Please convert the following caption into the JSON format shown below:

{
  "playback_speed": "State playback speed if altered, noting time-lapse / fast-motion / slow-motion  / stop-motion / speed-ramp /  time-reversed.",
  "lens_distortion": "Describe lens distortion if present, noting fisheye / barrel distortion.",
  "camera_height": "Specify camera height relative to the ground plane, such as aerial, overhead, eye, hip, ground, above water, or underwater. Note changes in height if there is any.",
  "camera_angle": "Specify camera angle relative to the ground plane, such as bird's eye, high, level, low, or worm's eye, and note any Dutch angle. Specify changes in angle only if angle changes.",
  "camera_focus": "Describe depth of field; if deep, note "deep focus" only; if shallow, specify the focus plane (foreground, midground, background), and any changes in focus (rack/pull, focus tracking).",
  "camera_steadiness": "Describe how stable the camera is, noting static shot / minimal shake / handheld / severe shake if present.",
  "camera_translation": "Describe translation direction and type, noting dolly in / dolly out / truck left / truck right / pedestal up / pedestal down / crane up / crane down.",
  "camera_rotation": "Describe rotation direction and type, such as pan left/right, tilt up/down, or roll clockwise/counterclockwise.",
  "camera_zoom": "Describe zoom in or out if present; if combined with dolly movement, note whether it is dolly-zoom-in or dolly-zoom-out.",
  "camera_arc": "Describe arc movements around a subject or the frame center, including horizontal arcs (arc clockwise or counterclockwise) and vertical arcs (crane up or down), and whether combined with tracking.",
  "tracking_shot": "If the camera tracks a subject, noting the spatial relationship as tracking from the front / tracking from the back / tracking from the side / tracking from above. Also note whether the subject appears larger, smaller, or unchanged in the frame during tracking.",
  "camera_movement_speed": " Only if notably slow or fast camera movement speed presents, note slow or fast.",
  "camera_movement_purpose": "Describe the reason and purpose of camera movement, such as tracking a subject, revealing a scene, or creating emphasis."

Caption Instruction:
Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  

If **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  

If **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  

Describe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  

If discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* that keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.

If the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (camera moves to follow a subject as it travels through space), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.

Try to make the description as concise as possible. For example, if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, regular or subtle movement speed, there is no need to mention these.

If the video is deep focus, just put in "Deep focus" in "camera_focus".
If there is no camera tracking mentioned in caption, leave 

When shot transitions occur, describe the camera framing and movement in each segment separately, note the type of transition (e.g., hard cut, soft transition), and explain how the framing and movement change between segments.
