{
  "type": "Briefly identify the shot type by summarizing the subject type mentioned in the caption (e.g., prominent human subject, non-human subject, subject appearance/disappearance, subject-type change, multiple subjects with or without a clear focus, or an atypical subject). Describe only what is explicitly indicated in the caption. List only the main subjects in the video (e.g., woman, man, dog, car). Do not include environment objects or background props (e.g., furniture, skateboards, trees). Do not include appearance or wardrobe details",
  "appearance": "Summarize key visual traits of each subject, such as hairstyle, facial hair, age, gender, ethnicity (if clear), or for objects, color, material, shape, and any distinctive marks.",

  "facial_expression": "If visible and relevant, describe each subject's facial expression clearly (e.g., smiling, frowning, neutral).",
  "pose": "Describe each subject's posture, stance, and orientation within the frame (e.g., standing, sitting, walking, facing camera).",

Caption Instruction:
Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don't mention things like "first frame" or "last frame"), and avoid using terms like "image" or "frame." Don't mention the background or motion unless it is necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.

Clearly identify each subject's type, using precise terms such as "man," "woman," "dog," "car," or "tree," rather than vague words like "thing" or "item." If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.

Describe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject's pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.

If there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as "the man," "the dog," or "the tree." If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., "the woman in the red dress," "the man with the beard"), location within the scene (e.g., "the man on the left," "the car in the midground"), actions (e.g., "the child playing with a ball," "the bird flying"), or relationships to each other (e.g., "the man next to the woman," "the first man that enters the frame"). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order is not relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.

When shot transitions occur, describe the subject in each segment separately, noting the type of transition (e.g., hard cut, soft transition) and explaining how the subjects change from one segment to the next.

If the video is a scenery shot without salient subjects, you do not need to describe a specific subject. Instead, concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., landscape, cityscape) in a single fluent paragraph. Briefly explain why there is no main subject, for example by noting that the focus is on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than on a particular object, using one to three sentences.

If the video features salient human or non-human subjects, focus your description on them. If the video features multiple subjects with a clear focus, you may describe the main subject in detail and briefly mention the secondary subjects. If the video features multiple subjects without a clear main focus, describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.

If the video features subjects revealing, disappearing, or switching, describe the transition in detail.

Caption: {caption}

Instructions:
1. Use the exact same JSON keys as shown above
2. Preserve all important information from the caption with all the keywords and details
3. Organize the information appropriately under each key
4. If the caption does not contain some information, please review the caption instruction above to determine what should be the input
5. It is okay to leave fields blank as "" if nothing is mentioned in the caption
6. Return only valid JSON without any additional text
7. No period after each caption
8. Don't mention any details of "wardrobe" and "appearance" in "type". Only mention each subject in short.
9. In the Appearance section, do not describe any information related to wardrobe, facial expression, or pose.
10. In the Relationship section, strictly avoid inferring or speculating about relationships between elements. Only describe relationships that are explicitly mentioned in the caption. Do not add any assumed or imagined relationships. If there is no direct relationship between them, do not mention one.
11. In the Pose section, describe only the pose of human subjects. Exclude all information related to objects.
12. Only describe subject reveals, disappearances, or changes in prominence in the Transition section. If none occur, leave it empty.
13. Landscape and environmental elements (such as mountains and clouds), as well as architectural elements (e.g., buildings), are not considered subjects. Do not include scenery-related or architectural information in the Type, Appearance, Wardrobe, Facial Expression, Pose, or Relationship sections. If the caption contains only landscape and environmental elements or architectural elements, keep the Type, Appearance, Wardrobe, Facial Expression, Pose, and Relationship sections empty.
14. In the Type section, avoid repeating identical terms. For example, instead of listing “man, man, man,” use expressions such as a specific number followed by the plural form (e.g., “three men”). If the caption mentions more than one subject of the same type, do not use the singular form in the Type section. Whenever possible, specify the exact number based on the caption to avoid ambiguity. Clearly indicate the prominent subject rather than listing all subjects with equal emphasis. The description should be written as a complete sentence, not as a list of isolated words or phrases. If the caption does not explicitly indicate a prominent subject, it is not necessary to designate one.
