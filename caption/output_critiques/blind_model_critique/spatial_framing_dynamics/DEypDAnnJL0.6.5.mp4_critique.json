    "pre_caption": "The frame presents a picture-in-picture composition featuring two separate video feeds. The primary feed, occupying the full screen, shows a medium close-up of a woman positioned in the center foreground. Behind her, a light-colored, textured wall is visible in the middle ground. A smaller, rectangular video overlay is situated in the bottom-right corner of the screen, covering a portion of the main subject. This overlay contains a medium close-up of a second woman, also in the foreground of her respective scene. Within this smaller frame, a wall with abstract art is in the middle ground, and a string of lights is visible on the left. The overall spatial arrangement remains static throughout the clip, with both cameras positioned at the height of their respective subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows two separate video feeds, suggesting a video call. The main, larger feed features a medium close-up of a young, light-skinned woman with curly, light brown hair and light-colored eyes. She is wearing a light green crewneck sweatshirt with a blue floral design on the chest. In a smaller video overlay in the bottom-right corner, a second woman is shown in a close-up, occupying only about half of the frame's height. This woman is fair-skinned with blonde hair and bangs, glasses pushed up on her forehead, and bright red lipstick. She is wearing a white collared shirt under a dark sweater and has a wide-eyed, surprised expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit space with a textured, light-colored wall. In the bottom right corner, a picture-in-picture video overlay displays a separate room. This secondary view is illuminated by blue and purple light and features a string of warm fairy lights on the left. On the wall within the overlay, a piece of abstract art with orange, black, and white geometric shapes is visible.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The frame shows two separate video feeds, each displaying a medium close-up of a woman, suggesting they are on a video call. The woman in yellow occupies the entire screen, while the woman in gray appears in a smaller video overlay in the bottom-right corner, covering about 25% of the screen and partially blocking a small part of the woman in yellow.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The video contains two separate frames, both with the camera positioned at the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the picture-in-picture format, but its claim that the arrangement is \"static\" is an oversimplification. In the video, the main woman in the center occasionally leans forward, which briefly tightens the medium close-up shot, and the woman in the overlay periodically turns her head toward the left side of her frame. The description of the main background wall as extending \"from the foreground to the background\" is spatially confusing; it would be more precise to describe it as a blurred wall occupying the middle ground, creating a shallow depth of field that isolates the subject. Furthermore, the caption misses a key spatial dynamic: the main subject's gaze is consistently directed down and to the right, indicating she is looking at the overlay of the second woman. Finally, the description of the overlay's contents could be more specific, noting that the abstract art is a large painting centered directly behind the second woman, and the string of lights hangs vertically along the far-left edge of her frame.",
