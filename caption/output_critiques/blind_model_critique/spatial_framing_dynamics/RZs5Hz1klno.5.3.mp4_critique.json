    "pre_caption": "This full shot, captured from the subjects' level, presents a static scene centered on a craps table in the middle ground. The table occupies the lower half of the frame. Surrounding it are six metallic figures: a seated figure is in the bottom-left foreground, with two standing figures positioned behind him on the left. A standing figure is located in the center, behind the table, while two seated figures are on the right side of the frame. In the background, more gaming tables and figures are visible, adding depth to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of six human-like figures with metallic, silver skin and hair are gathered around a green felt craps table. On the left, a male figure wearing a light blue t-shirt and blue jeans is seated, with another male figure in a white t-shirt standing to his left. A male figure in a grey t-shirt is seated next to another male figure in a light yellow t-shirt who is holding a dark smartphone. The man in the yellow t-shirt initially appears in the center-left and moves to the center as the camera shifts. On the right side of the table, a male figure in a dark grey collared shirt is seated next to a seated female figure with her hair in a bun, who is wearing a light blue collared shirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting resembling a casino, several mannequin-like figures with a silver, metallic texture are gathered around a craps table. These figures are dressed in casual clothing of various colors, including blue, gray, and yellow. The craps table features a green felt top with red and white betting lines and a dark wooden rim. In the dimly lit background, more gaming tables and similar figures populate the space, which has a light gray floor. The overall scene has a desaturated, monochromatic style, with the primary colors coming from the green table and the figures' attire.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the standing figure \"to his left\" is ambiguous; specifying their position relative to the frame, such as \"to the left of the seated figure,\" would provide clearer spatial orientation. The caption identifies the game as craps, but the presence of multiple seated figures around the main table suggests it is more likely a card game like poker or blackjack, as craps is typically played while standing. The description of the camera movement is vague; specifying the type of movement, such as a slow pan to the right, would more accurately describe how the figure in the yellow shirt shifts from center-left to the center. Furthermore, the two seated figures on the right are not assigned a depth position; clarifying if they are in the foreground at the main table or in the middle ground is necessary. Finally, the description of the background is too general, and the phrase \"enhancing the depth of the scene\" is an interpretive comment rather than a direct spatial observation.",
