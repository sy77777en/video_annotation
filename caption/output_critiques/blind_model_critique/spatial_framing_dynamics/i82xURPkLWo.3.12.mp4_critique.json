    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot frames a man who is centered in the foreground. Behind him, a wall of vertical wooden slats occupies the background. The man initially looks directly toward the camera, then briefly shifts his gaze toward the right side of the frame before returning his focus to the camera. The camera remains stationary at the man's eye level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged Black man with a medium skin tone is shown in a close-up. He has a short, buzzed haircut and a neatly trimmed goatee, wearing a plain, mauve-colored t-shirt. Initially, he looks directly at the viewer with a somber and pained expression, his brow furrowing slightly as if in distress. As he begins to speak, his gaze shifts forward and to the right, before finally returning to look directly at the viewer. His eyes appear weary, conveying a sense of deep emotional hurt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This daytime scene takes place in a rustic, semi-outdoor setting, possibly a wooden porch or open-air structure. The background is softly out of focus and features a wall constructed of vertical wooden slats. The overall color palette is muted, composed of earthy greens and browns, illuminated by soft, natural light. A man in a mauve t-shirt is positioned in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject and action, but it could be more precise about the spatial composition and dynamics. The term \"close-up\" is general; specifying that it is a medium close-up framing the man from the shoulders up would be more descriptive. While the caption states the man is \"centered,\" he might be positioned slightly to the right of the frame, leaving negative space on the left that motivates his glance. A key spatial detail is omitted: the shallow depth of field, which renders the man in sharp focus while the background slats are blurred, visually separating the foreground from the background. Furthermore, the description misses a potential shadow cast by the man onto the background wall, an element that would help define the distance between him and the wall. Finally, clarifying the \"gaze shift\" would improve the description of movement; specifying whether only his eyes move or if his head turns slightly would provide a more accurate account of the change in his spatial orientation to the camera.",
