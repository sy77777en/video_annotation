    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot. The scene is captured from a low angle, looking up at a row of modern residential buildings that extend diagonally from the lower-left to the upper-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground and background. In the middle ground, a pedestrian bridge with white supports spans horizontally across the frame, situated above a canal that fills the foreground at the bottom. The sky with clouds is visible in the top portion of the frame. The camera slowly zooms out, widening the perspective to reveal more of the buildings on the far left and right, as well as more of the canal and its stone-lined bank in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dynamic cityscape scene featuring a row of contemporary residential buildings along a canal on a bright, sunny day. The camera zooms out to reveal varied architecture, with structures of different heights, some featuring traditional gabled roofs while others have modern flat roofs with terraces and rooftop gardens. The facades display a mix of colors, including white, grey, and a prominent red building, all characterized by large windows and balconies. A modern pedestrian bridge with white supports spans the canal in the middle ground, enhancing the composition. The scene is designed to capture the overall architectural aesthetic and the peaceful, modern atmosphere of this urban waterside environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A daytime scene captures a row of modern, multi-story residential buildings situated along a canal under a partly cloudy blue sky. The architecture is varied, featuring a mix of flat and gabled roofs, numerous balconies, and large windows, with one building distinguished by a red facade. In the middle ground, a pedestrian bridge with white support pillars spans the calm water. Green trees are interspersed among the buildings and along the stone-lined canal bank.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the wide shot, low angle, and the slow zoom-out, it could be improved by avoiding assumptions and including more dynamic detail. The terms 'residential buildings' and 'pedestrian bridge' are speculative; a more precise description would be 'modern buildings' and 'bridge' unless their function is explicitly clear. The 'dark box' in the foreground is vague; if it's identifiable as, for instance, a dark stone bench, specifying this would add clarity. The description also overlooks potential secondary movements within the scene, such as the slow drift of clouds across the top of the frame or subtle ripples on the canal's surface. Furthermore, if there were any people, for example, a person walking from right to left across the bridge in the middle ground, their movement would be a key spatial dynamic to include. Finally, the canal's path described as extending 'from the bottom right foreground to the bottom left background' is slightly confusing; a clearer phrasing might be 'receding from the bottom-right foreground towards the center-left middle ground'.",
