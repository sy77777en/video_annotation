    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, positioning a skateboarder in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground of a covered walkway, with a black handrail curving through the foreground from the bottom left. As the skateboarder moves toward the camera, the framing transitions to a full shot, placing him in the foreground before he jumps over a central set of stairs. During the jump, he is captured from a low angle, occupying the upper center of the frame against the ceiling in the background. After landing in the foreground, he moves toward the left side of the frame and recedes into the middle ground, causing the shot to transition back to a wide shot. Throughout the video, a group of people remains stationary in the middle ground on the far left, and the entire scene is distorted by a fisheye lens, which curves the architectural lines of the walkway. The camera maintains a low position, close to the ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with light skin, long dark hair reaching his neck, and no visible facial hair, wearing a black t-shirt and loose blue jeans, skateboarding. He is standing upright on a skateboard, facing forward as he moves along a covered walkway. In one part of the video, he approaches the camera, and in another, he is seen from behind as he moves away. There are also five other people visible in the middle ground, sitting or standing near a wall; they appear to be watching the man on the skateboard. These individuals are dressed in black clothing, and their features are less distinct due to their distance from the camera. The focus remains on the man skateboarding throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place during the day along a covered outdoor walkway of a building. The floor is made of light-colored speckled tiles, and the walkway features a short ramp bordered by a black metal handrail and a small set of marble steps. The building's walls are a mix of light yellow paint on the upper portion and varied textures below, including green horizontal siding and red horizontal siding. The upper portions of the walls also include white walls with red graffiti and glass windows covered by black metal security bars. In the background, beyond the open side of the walkway, parked cars and other buildings are visible. The entire scene is viewed through a fisheye lens, which causes the architectural lines to curve and distort, creating a circular effect at the periphery. A person on a skateboard moves along the walkway and jumps down the stairs.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a man skateboarding. It begins with a wide shot of him, which changes to a full shot as he approaches the camera. As he moves away from the camera, it transitions back to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the skateboarder's movement creates a spatial contradiction; it states he moves \"toward the camera\" but remains in the \"middle ground,\" whereas moving toward the camera would naturally shift his position into the foreground. The description of the jump is also slightly static; instead of just noting his position at the apex, it could more dynamically describe his arc from the center to the upper center of the frame. Furthermore, the caption introduces a significant inconsistency by stating the \"camera tracks the main subject's jump,\" which implies camera movement, yet the overall description suggests a fixed, static camera, a common technique for this type of shot. This needs to be clarified: either the camera is static and the subject moves through the frame, or the camera movement should be described consistently throughout the action. Finally, the appearance of the \"group of people\" is vague; the caption should specify if they walk into the frame from the left edge or were previously out of focus in the background, and clarify their position relative to the skateboarder's landing point to provide a more complete spatial picture.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a wide shot, positioning a skateboarder in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground of a covered walkway, with a black handrail curving through the foreground from the bottom left. As the skateboarder moves closer to the camera, he transitions into the foreground, and the framing shifts to a full shot before he jumps over a central set of stairs. During the jump, he follows an arc from the center to the upper center of the frame, captured from a low angle against the ceiling in the background. After landing in the foreground, he moves toward the left side of the frame and recedes into the middle ground, transitioning back to a wide shot. Throughout the video, a group of people remains stationary in the middle ground on the far left, having been present from the start. The entire scene is distorted by a fisheye lens, which curves the architectural lines of the walkway. The camera maintains a low, static position, close to the ground, allowing the skateboarder to move dynamically through the frame.",
