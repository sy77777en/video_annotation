    "pre_caption": "This is a full shot where two square photographs are positioned side-by-side in the center of the frame against a gray, speckled background. The black and white photograph is on the left, and the color photograph is on the right. In the top center of the frame, a horizontal, teal-colored rope is mounted on the wall above the pictures. The photographs and the rope are in the foreground, with the wall serving as the background. The entire composition remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two square photographs are presented side-by-side on a gray, speckled wall. The photograph on the left is in black and white, showing a cluster of old, wooden houses, including both single-story and two-story structures with pitched roofs, lining the edge of a body of water. Taller houses with pitched roofs are visible behind them. Most of the buildings and trees on the ground are reflected in the calm water. The photograph on the right is in color and depicts a modern, multi-story apartment building with a light-colored facade and numerous balconies, also situated next to water, with its reflection visible on the surface. Above the two photographs, a horizontal, twisted, teal-colored rope is pinned to the wall, with its ends bent into vertical short lines pointing downward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Two square photographs are displayed side-by-side on a gray wall with white specks. Above them, a teal-colored, twisted horizontal rope is mounted to the wall, with its ends folded into vertical short lines pointing downward. The photograph on the left is in black and white and shows several rustic wooden houses along a body of water, with their reflections mirrored below. The photograph on the right is in color and features modern, multi-story buildings also situated by water, with their reflections visible on the surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Due to insufficient background information, it is difficult to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subjects and their initial positions, but it lacks detail regarding the camera's movement and its effect on all framed elements. The description of the movement is incomplete; it only mentions the rope exiting from the top but fails to describe what happens to the two photographs. A more accurate description would specify that as the camera tilts upward, the photographs, initially in the center, move toward the bottom of the frame and exit first. The caption should also clarify the type of camera movement, identifying it as a \"tilt up\" rather than a generic \"moves.\" Furthermore, the term \"full shot\" is ambiguous for this composition; \"medium shot\" would be more precise. The description could also benefit from specifying the camera's height, noting that it starts at eye-level with the photographs. Finally, the concluding phrase \"with the wall serving as the background\" is redundant and could be omitted for better conciseness.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a medium shot where two square photographs are positioned side-by-side in the center of the frame against a gray, speckled background. The black and white photograph is on the left, and the color photograph is on the right. A horizontal, teal-colored rope is mounted on the wall above the pictures. The camera starts at eye-level with the photographs and tilts upward, causing the photographs to move toward the bottom of the frame and exit first, followed by the rope exiting from the top. The entire composition remains static until the camera movement begins.",
