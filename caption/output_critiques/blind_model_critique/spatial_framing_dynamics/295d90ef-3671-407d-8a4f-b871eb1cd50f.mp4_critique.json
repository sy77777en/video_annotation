    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot, initially framing a skier in the top center of the frame and in the foreground, captured mid-air against a clear sky in the background. The camera, positioned below the skier, follows them as they descend, and the background transitions to a vast mountain range with a prominent peak in the center. The skier travels from the top center of the frame downwards, moving into the middle ground as the camera's perspective shifts to be above them. The skier lands in the bottom center of the frame on a snowy slope, where a large plume of snow erupts and obscures them from view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A skier, dressed in all-black winter gear including a helmet, a long-sleeved top, and pants, performs an aerial maneuver. The skier's equipment includes black skis with a white logo, which sometimes appear light-colored due to sunlight reflection, and ski poles. The video captures the skier rotating in mid-air before landing on the snow, causing a large plume of white snow to spray upwards and obscure them from view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a vast, sunlit, snow-covered mountain range during the day under a clear sky. A prominent, jagged, snow-capped peak dominates the background, surrounded by other rocky mountains. The landscape is a wide expanse of snowfields and snow-capped mountains. A skier dressed in dark clothing is captured performing a jump, rotating in mid-air before descending. The skier lands on the snowy slope, kicking up a large cloud of white powder upon impact.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the main action and the shift in camera perspective, but it could be more precise with its spatial terminology and dynamic description. The use of \"midground\" is confusing; initially, the skier is in the air against a background sky, making their depth relative. It would be clearer to state the skier begins in the background and moves toward the midground landing slope. The phrase \"moving into the middle ground\" is also awkward; a better description would be that the skier descends from the sky toward the snowy slope occupying the midground. Furthermore, while the background transition is noted, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the texture of the landing zone—for instance, an untouched field of powder in the midground that becomes visible as the camera tilts down. The final moment could also be more dynamic; instead of just being obscured, the skier is engulfed by the plume of snow which rapidly expands from the bottom center to fill the lower half of the frame, effectively ending the subject's visible action. Finally, the description of the camera \"following\" the skier could be improved by specifying the camera action, such as \"the camera tilts downward,\" which more accurately describes how the background changes from sky to mountains.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a wide shot, capturing a skier in the top center of the frame, soaring through the air against a clear sky. Positioned below, the camera tilts downward, tracking the skier's descent as they move from the background sky toward the midground, where a pristine field of powdery snow awaits. As the skier approaches the snowy slope, the background transitions to reveal a vast mountain range with a prominent peak at its center. The skier lands gracefully in the bottom center of the frame, and a dynamic plume of snow erupts, rapidly expanding to fill the lower half of the frame, engulfing the skier and concluding the visible action.",
