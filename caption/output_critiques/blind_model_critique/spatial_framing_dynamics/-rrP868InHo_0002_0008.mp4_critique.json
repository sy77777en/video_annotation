    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot initially frames a woman in profile in the left-center of the frame, occupying the foreground as she drinks from a cup held in the center. To her right, a large potted plant sits in the middle ground, with a window and red decorations visible in the background. The camera then subtly pulls back, slightly widening the frame to reveal more of her shoulders and the background on the left, which includes other patrons. Simultaneously, the woman lowers the cup out of the frame while maintaining her position and looking toward the right. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young adult East Asian woman with light skin and dark hair pulled back is shown in profile. She wears a black jacket with a visible silver snap button over a lighter-colored top and has a small, delicate gold stud earring in her right ear. She brings a white and yellow paper cup, which features a red calligraphic design, to her lips to take a drink with her eyes open, occasionally blinking. She then lowers the cup and looks toward the right of the frame with a slight smile.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set during the daytime in a brightly lit space, likely a cafe or restaurant, with large black-framed panels of glass resembling windows or doors. Sunlight casts across the area, illuminating the space. In front of the panels of glass, a large potted plant with dark green leaves sits in a white container. The surrounding is decorated with red elements, including small hanging lanterns and a red calligraphy hanging down. In the background, other tables, chairs, and patrons are visible. A woman in front of the panels of glass, serving as the main subject, drinks from a paper cup decorated with a red and gold design.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject and camera height, it understates the visual impact of the camera movement and misses key spatial details. The description of the camera \"mov[ing] forward while zooming out\" fails to capture the resulting dolly zoom effect, where the background would appear to expand dramatically around the subject, rather than just \"subtly widening.\" The caption also omits the change in shot size, which would transition from a close-up to a medium close-up by the end. Furthermore, the spatial depth could be more precise; the woman's hand and cup are in the foreground, not just at a 2D position, and the \"large potted plant\" is likely in the foreground or near-midground, not the middle ground, to be so prominent. The newly revealed \"other patrons\" lack a specified position and depth, such as being blurred figures in the deep background. Finally, the statement about \"maintaining the framing of the woman\" is contradicted by her head shifting to the center; it would be more accurate to state the camera reframes her to the center as she turns.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a woman in profile, positioned in the left-center of the frame, as she drinks from a cup held prominently in the foreground. To her right, a large potted plant is situated in the foreground or near-midground, with a window and red decorations visible in the background. The camera executes a dolly zoom, moving forward while zooming out, which creates a dramatic effect as the background appears to expand around the subject. This movement transitions the shot from a close-up to a medium close-up, revealing more of the woman's shoulders and the background on the left, where other patrons appear as blurred figures in the deep background. As the woman lowers the cup out of the frame, she turns her head toward the right, and the camera reframes her to the center, maintaining the subject's level throughout the shot.",
