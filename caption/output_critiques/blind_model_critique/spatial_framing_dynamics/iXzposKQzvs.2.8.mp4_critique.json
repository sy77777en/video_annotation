    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, the camera positioned at the subject's level. A female diver is in the center-right of the frame, standing in the middle ground on a light blue diving board. To her left, also in the middle ground, several judges are seated on high chairs. The background consists of grey tiered spectator stands, partially filled with an audience, occupying the upper portion of the frame. The bright blue swimming pool is in the foreground at the bottom. As the diver performs her dive, moving upwards from the board and then arcing downwards, the camera tilts down, transitioning to a full shot from an above-subject perspective. The diver enters the water in the bottom-center of the frame, now in the foreground, with the splash occurring in the center foreground as the pool surface comes to dominate the view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video primarily features a light-skinned woman with her blonde hair tied back, wearing a blue one-piece swimsuit, as she performs a dive from a springboard into a pool. She bends at the waist, springs off the board, tucks her body during the aerial rotation, and enters the water. Observing the dive are several men, positioned on high chairs beside the pool; they are dressed in dark suits over light-colored shirts with ties, and all wear light-colored face masks. In the background, an audience of men and women, wearing varied casual clothing and face masks, is seated in tiered stands watching the event.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place in an indoor aquatic center during a diving competition, marked by \"TOKYO 2020\" signage and the Olympic rings. The scene begins with the bright blue swimming pool visible at the bottom of the frame, becoming more prominent as the camera tilts downward. Multiple light blue, flexible diving boards are positioned above the pool. In the background, grey tiered spectator stands are partially occupied by people, many wearing face masks. The sequence captures movement from one of the diving boards into the pool, concluding with a visible splash in the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the diver being in the \"foreground\" and the pool in the \"middle ground\" is spatially confusing; given the diver is on a board above the pool, it's more likely she is in the middle ground of the scene's depth, positioned in the upper-center of the frame, with the pool occupying the bottom of the frame below her. The description of the camera movement as a \"transition to a full shot\" is also misleading. It is not a cut or a new shot, but a continuous camera tilt that follows the diver's arc, causing the perspective to shift from eye-level to a high-angle view as she enters the water. Furthermore, the initial shot is better described as a medium-long shot to establish the environment, and the framing as she hits the water is closer to a medium shot, making the repeated use of \"full shot\" inaccurate. Finally, the description of the pool \"extending from the foreground to the background\" after the splash is vague; it would be clearer to state that the splash occurs in the bottom-center, with the resulting ripples dominating the middle ground of the frame.",

As the diver performs her dive, moving upwards from the board and then arcing downwards, the camera tilts down, smoothly transitioning from an eye-level to a high-angle view.
