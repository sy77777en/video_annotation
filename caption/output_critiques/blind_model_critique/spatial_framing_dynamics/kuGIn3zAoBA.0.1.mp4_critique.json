    "pre_caption": "A medium close-up shot frames a man in the center-right foreground. He is positioned against a backdrop of a body of water in the middle ground and a distant, hazy shoreline in the background. The camera remains static at the man's eye level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned, middle-aged man with a bald head and short gray hair on the sides is shown speaking. He is wearing a white, short-sleeved polo shirt adorned with several logos. On the right side of his chest, a crest-like logo is visible with text above and below it. On the left side of his chest, there is a red and black logo with the words \"SYNDADS ATLANTIC.\" A black patch with white lettering is on his left sleeve, and a small, colorful logo is on his collar. He is positioned facing slightly to the left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors during the day, with a man positioned in the foreground against the backdrop of a large, calm body of water under a clear, pale sky. In the soft-focus background, a harbor or bay is visible, where numerous boats are scattered across the water in front of a distant, hazy shoreline. The entire setting is brightly illuminated by natural daylight.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the shot size, the subject's position, and the scene's depth, but it fails to describe any subject movement, making the video sound like a static photograph. For instance, the man might turn his head from the camera towards the water, a key spatial dynamic that is completely omitted. The description of his framing as a \"medium close-up\" could be more precise by specifying that he is framed from the chest up. Furthermore, the caption does not mention the man's orientation within the frame—whether he is facing the camera, in profile, or at a three-quarter angle, and if this orientation changes. While the background elements are correctly placed in the middle and background, the description could be enhanced by noting the position of any other distinct, non-moving elements, such as a small pier on the left side of the middle ground, which would provide a more complete spatial map of the scene without adding subjective detail.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium close-up shot frames a man from the chest up in the center-right foreground. He initially faces the camera but gradually turns his head towards the body of water in the middle ground, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The backdrop features a distant, hazy shoreline in the background, while a small pier is visible on the left side of the middle ground. The camera remains static at the man's eye level throughout the shot, capturing his movement and the spatial arrangement of the scene.",
