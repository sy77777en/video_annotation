    "pre_caption": "A high-angle, isometric wide shot presents a diagram against a dark grid background. In the center-left middle ground, a cluster of groceries, coins, and a \"Buy\" button is positioned. From this point, a glowing line extends to a voucher and a shopping basket in the top-right middle ground, with a \"5%\" label displayed along it. Another line extends to a stack of banknotes in the bottom-right middle ground. During the shot, a \"95%\" label appears on this lower line as the stack of banknotes increases in height. The text \"Own opinion\" remains static in the bottom-right corner of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An isometric animation on a dark grid background depicts a financial transaction. In the center-left, a collection of items includes various groceries like a red sausage, a yellow wheel of cheese, a white carton of eggs, and a white bottle with a blue cap, alongside a stack of gold coins. A teal, rectangular button with the word \"Buy\" in white text is positioned in front of these items. From this central group, two glowing light-blue lines extend. The upper line, labeled with \"5%\", connects to a white paper receipt labeled \"Voucher\" with a yellow plastic shopping basket positioned to the right. The lower line, labeled with \"95%\", connects to a stack of green banknotes marked with the euro symbol. The white text \"Own opinion\" is displayed in the bottom-right corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an animated, isometric diagram set against a dark grid background, a collection of 3D grocery items, including sausages, cheese, eggs, and a milk bottle, is positioned next to a green \"Buy\" button. A glowing line extends from the button upwards to a yellow shopping basket positioned to the right of a white sheet of paper labeled \"Voucher.\" Another glowing line extends downwards to a stack of green banknotes marked with a Euro symbol. Overlaid text displays \"5%\" along the upper line. The text \"95%\" appears as an overlay on the lower line as the stack of banknotes increases. In the bottom right corner, the text \"Own opinion\" is present as a static overlay.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a good overview of the diagram's components and their actions, but it lacks precision regarding the spatial framing and the specifics of the animation. The description should begin by establishing the shot size and camera perspective, such as \"In a static, eye-level medium shot,\" which is currently missing. While you mention 2D positions like \"center-left,\" you omit the 3D depth; it would be more complete to state that all diagram elements are positioned in the middle ground against the background grid. The description of the animation is too general. For example, instead of saying a line \"extends,\" you could specify that it \"animates outward\" or \"is drawn\" from one point to another. Similarly, \"appears\" is vague; does the \"95%\" label fade in, pop up, or slide into place? The growth of the banknote stack could also be more detailed—does it grow smoothly, or do individual bills animate to form the stack? Finally, the term \"cluster\" is imprecise; a more accurate description might detail the specific arrangement of the groceries, coins, and \"Buy\" button relative to each other, which would provide a clearer picture of the diagram's starting point.",

Another line is drawn to a stack of banknotes in the bottom-right, where a \"95%\" label fades in as individual bills animate smoothly to form the growing stack.
