    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, an Xbox One console is positioned in the middle ground, occupying the top-left and center of the frame. In the foreground, a blurry controller is situated in the bottom-right corner. The camera is positioned above the subjects, looking down at them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black Xbox One console is displayed in a dimly lit, greenish-hued environment. The console is rectangular, with a two-tone finish on its top surface—half matte and half glossy. The front of the console features the \"XBOX\" name and logo on the left, a horizontal disc drive slot, and a glowing white, circular Xbox logo power button on the right. In the blurry foreground, a black Xbox One controller is positioned to the right, resting on the same dark surface as the console.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, minimalist setting, a black Xbox console is positioned on a flat surface under dim, greenish lighting. The console features a rectangular, two-tone design with a matte finish on the left side, which bears the \"XBOX\" logo, and a glossy finish on the right, where an illuminated circular Xbox power button glows. A black controller rests in the blurred foreground. The scene is characterized by deep shadows and soft highlights on the top surfaces of the hardware. A small white overlay in the lower left corner displays \"[25].\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subjects and their general placement, but it lacks specificity and fails to describe the complete spatial environment and any potential dynamics. The term \"full shot\" is ambiguous for an object; \"medium shot\" would be more precise if the console fills a significant portion of the frame. The description of the controller as simply being in the \"bottom-right corner\" is too general; it could be improved by specifying that perhaps only the top portion of the controller, with its joysticks and buttons, is visible. Furthermore, the caption omits any description of the background, which might be an out-of-focus wooden entertainment center or wall that would complete the sense of depth. Most critically, the caption assumes a completely static scene. It misses the opportunity to describe subtle movements, such as a slow, almost imperceptible camera pan from left to right that slightly alters the composition, or the blinking white power light on the console, which is a small but notable dynamic element within the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium shot captures an Xbox One console prominently in the top-left and center of the frame, with a blurry controller in the bottom-right corner, where only the top portion with its joysticks and buttons is visible. The camera is positioned above, looking down at the subjects. In the background, an out-of-focus wooden entertainment center adds depth to the scene. The composition subtly shifts with a slow, almost imperceptible camera pan from left to right, while the console's white power light blinks gently, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static setup.",
