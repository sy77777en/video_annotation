    "pre_caption": "The scene opens with a full shot of an 18th-century garden party. In the foreground, a man in a dark coat walks from the left to the right side of the frame, leading two dogs. The middle ground is populated with several groups of people: a central group sits and stands in conversation, another group including a child sits on the grass to the left, and two women sit on the grass to the right. A large striped tent extends from the center to the right side of the frame in the middle ground. In the left background, a grand palace is visible in the distance. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, slowly zooms out, transitioning into a wide shot that reveals more of the expansive lawn and further emphasizes the scale of the palace in the background, making the figures in the middle ground appear smaller within the vast setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large group of people in 18th-century attire are gathered on a vast green lawn for an outdoor party. In the foreground, a man with dark hair wearing a dark green coat, a black tricorn hat, and a red sash walks from left to right, holding a walking stick and leading two medium-sized dogs—one brown and the other off-white. In the center, a group is engaged in conversation; a man with a white powdered wig and a tan coat sits on a wooden chair, next to a woman in a light-colored dress and a large hat adorned with a white feather. Facing them is another seated man in a blue-grey coat with brown hair, while another man with a white powdered wig and a dark coat stands to the right of him. To the left, another group sits on the grass, including a man with long brown hair, a woman in a light dress and straw hat, and a small child in a red coat. Several other men in dark coats and powdered wigs are also seated on the grass nearby. On the right, two women in light-colored, full-skirted dresses and hats sit on the ground. A large blue-and-white striped tent with a yellow and red interior is positioned in the center and extends to the far right, sheltering more guests seated at tables. In the distant background, a massive, classical-style palace is visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is an outdoor garden party set on a vast green lawn during the day, under an overcast sky. In the background stands a grand, sprawling palace of classical design. To the right, a large marquee with a blue-and-white striped roof and a matching scalloped valance shelters a dining area with a red-and-yellow interior. Numerous people in 18th-century attire are gathered across the lawn; some sit on the grass and chairs in small groups, while others stand and converse. A man in a dark coat and hat walks across the foreground with two dogs on a leash. In the distance, several horses are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subjects and their general placement, it describes the scene with a static quality that doesn't fully capture the video's imagined movement and dynamics. The description of the man walking with \"two dogs on the man's left front\" is slightly awkward; \"to his left and slightly ahead of him\" would be more natural. The caption misses the subtle, continuous movements within the static groups; for instance, the central group is actively gesturing in conversation, and the child on the left is not just sitting but is seen rolling a hoop on the grass. More importantly, the camera movement is not just a slow zoom out but also includes a subtle, concurrent pan to the right, which follows the man's movement and keeps him centered as he approaches the right edge of the frame before the zoom accelerates. The description of the camera height as \"at the subjects' level\" is too general, as some are sitting; it is more precisely at the eye-level of the standing figures in the foreground. Finally, the effect of the zoom-out could be described more dynamically; it doesn't just make the figures smaller but actively shifts the frame's focus, diminishing the prominence of the foreground conversations and elevating the grand scale of the tent and the palace to become the dominant visual subjects by the end of the shot.",
