    "pre_caption": "In an initial wide shot, a passenger airplane is positioned in the left-center of the frame and in the middle ground. Below and ahead of it, an illuminated airport occupies the center-right background. The bottom half of the frame is filled with a dark, teal-glowing surface that extends from the foreground into the background. As the video progresses, the airplane flies forward and away from the camera, moving deeper into the background toward the airport. Consequently, the plane becomes smaller relative to the frame, shifting its position from the left-center toward the center. The camera remains at the airplane's altitude throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-colored passenger airplane is shown from a rear three-quarter view as it approaches an airport for a nighttime landing. The plane, appearing as a silhouette against the dark sky, has its landing gear down. Below and ahead of the aircraft, an airport complex is visible, featuring brightly lit terminal buildings. The airport is set in a dark environment, with digital effects creating a teal-colored glow that adds an aperture effect to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a nighttime scene, a large passenger airplane, viewed from its rear quarter, descends toward a dimly lit airport. The plane is a dark silhouette with its landing gear deployed against the black sky. The airport features a section of brightly illuminated terminal buildings, while the majority of the area is enveloped in a teal-colored glow, likely due to digital effects creating an aperture effect around the airport. The surroundings are quite dark, making it difficult to determine if the scene is set on a coastline or an island, and there is no visible body of water. In the distance to the left, the faint, unlit structures of a city are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the airplane's size change is contradictory to its movement; as the plane moves \"away from the camera\" and \"deeper into the midground,\" it would logically appear smaller, not \"larger relative to the frame.\" Based on the video, this size increase is due to a slow camera zoom-in that is not mentioned in the caption. The phrase \"flies forward and away\" is also ambiguous; the plane is actually moving from the left side of the frame towards the right and receding into the depth of the scene. Furthermore, the caption omits the crucial detail that the entire scene is captured from a high angle, which is necessary to understand why the terminal buildings are \"below\" the airplane. The description of \"camera movements\" is too vague; the camera is specifically panning to the right and zooming in to track the plane, which causes both the plane and the airport scenery to shift toward the center of the frame. A more accurate caption would specify the high-angle shot and the pan-and-zoom camera action to correctly explain the observed spatial dynamics and resolve the contradiction in the airplane's perceived size.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a high-angle wide shot of a passenger airplane positioned in the left-center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. Below and ahead of it, an illuminated airport occupies the center-right background. The bottom half of the frame features a dark, teal-glowing surface extending from the foreground into the background. As the video progresses, the airplane moves from the left side of the frame toward the right, receding into the depth of the scene. The camera pans to the right and zooms in, tracking the plane's movement, which causes both the plane and the airport scenery to shift toward the center of the frame. This camera action results in the airplane appearing larger relative to the frame, despite moving away from the camera. The camera maintains a consistent altitude with the airplane throughout the shot.",
