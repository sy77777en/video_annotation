    "pre_caption": "This static wide shot captures a dense city street at night, focusing on the scenery. The camera is positioned at an elevated, level angle, looking down the street that occupies the center of the frame and recedes into the background. Tall, dark buildings line the left and right sides of the frame from the middle ground to the background, creating a canyon-like perspective. A large, horizontal yellow sign is positioned in the foreground at the bottom center. Numerous vertical neon signs in green, red, and white are located in the middle ground and background, stacked vertically down the center of the composition. A crowd of people is visible on the street below, primarily in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a level-angle view of a bustling city street at night, showcasing a narrow, densely packed urban scene. The street is alive with a multitude of vertical and horizontal neon signs glowing in green, red, and yellow, with Chinese characters illuminating the dark alleyway between tall, shadowy buildings. Below, a crowd of people moves through the street, adding to the sense of constant activity. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on capturing the vibrant, almost overwhelming atmosphere and the dense urban texture of the environment. The shot emphasizes the scale and energy of the city street rather than any individual element within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a level angle, a narrow and crowded city street is viewed at night, flanked by dark, multi-story buildings. The scene is illuminated by an array of vertical and horizontal neon signs with Chinese characters, casting a glow in shades of green, red, and yellow. In the foreground, a large horizontal sign with yellow panels and blue characters has the words \"唱片盒带\" in Chinese below it. The street below is densely packed with pedestrians moving through the illuminated space.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the downward tilt from a high angle and the general composition of the street, it misses key dynamic elements and spatial relationships that seem central to the scene. The description of the camera as being at a \"level angle\" is confusing; \"high-angle\" would be more accurate. The caption fails to describe the movement within the scene; for instance, the crowd of people and numerous vehicles are not static but flow continuously down the central street, away from the camera, enhancing the sense of depth. The \"large, horizontal yellow sign\" is not just positioned at the bottom center but is a digital billboard with scrolling text that moves from right to left, and as the camera tilts down, this sign moves from the bottom edge of the frame to occupy the lower third. Furthermore, the caption omits crucial atmospheric details that define the space, such as the wet pavement that creates vivid reflections of the neon signs, and the steam rising from vents in the foreground, which partially obscures the view of the street initially before the tilt reveals more. Describing the flow of traffic and the changing position and nature of the yellow sign would more accurately capture the \"dynamic\" quality of the shot.",
