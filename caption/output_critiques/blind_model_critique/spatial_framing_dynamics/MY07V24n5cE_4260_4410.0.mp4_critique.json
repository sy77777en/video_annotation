    "pre_caption": "This full shot, captured from the subjects' level, presents a centrally composed scene within a dark, misty space. In the middle ground, a person lies on a transparent pedestal located at the center of a circular platform, which occupies the bottom center of the frame. Five robed figures are arranged symmetrically around them: two stand on the left and two on the right in the middle ground, with a fifth figure positioned in the center background, forming a semi-circle. Beams of light descend from the top right, illuminating the central action. Throughout the shot, a white, web-like structure of particles materializes and swirls dynamically above the person on the pedestal in the center middle ground, while the camera and all figures remain stationary.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark, open space with a circular raised platform, a person in reddish-orange clothing lies on a translucent, crystalline table. Focused beams of cool white light illuminate the scene from above. A glowing, white, web-like structure made of dots materializes over their body and then ascends and disappears. Five tall figures in long, black, hooded robes stand around the table on a tiered platform. These figures have skeletal faces and hold their hands clasped in front of them as if in prayer or ritual. Two of the skeletal figures stand to the left, two to the right, and one is positioned in the center, all focused on the person on the table.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark space with a slightly elevated circular, multi-tiered platform, several hazy beams of bluish-white light cast from the top right and slightly project downward to the left, creating a mysterious atmosphere. At the center of the frame, a figure lies upon a translucent, crystalline altar. Two skeletal figures in dark, hooded robes stand to the left, two to the right, and one in the center, all with their hands clasped. A white, web-like field of energy particles materializes and swirls upward from the central figure before disappearing. The overall scene is rendered in dark, monochromatic tones.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the core elements and camera movement, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and visual hierarchy. The term \"full shot\" is slightly misleading for the initial framing; it begins closer to a medium-long shot, as the central person spans from the foreground to the midground, and only transitions into a full or long shot as the camera pulls back. The description of the figures as \"symmetrically arranged\" is contradicted by the singular light source from the \"top right,\" which would likely cast strong, asymmetrical shadows and highlight the right-side figures more than the left, a key detail that is omitted. Furthermore, the description of the particle effect is too general; it fails to mention how the \"web-like structure\" expands outward from the central person, momentarily obscuring the faces of the surrounding figures before it contracts and shoots upward, which is a significant spatial interaction. Finally, the caption misses the opportunity to connect the \"misty space\" to the perception of depth, as the mist could make the foreground figures appear sharper while softening the details of those in the midground, an effect that would be amplified as the camera recedes.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene opens with a medium-long shot, capturing a person lying on a transparent pedestal that spans from the foreground to the midground, situated at the center of a circular platform. Five robed figures are positioned around them: two on the left and two on the right in the midground, with a fifth figure in the center background, forming a semi-circle. A single beam of light from the top right casts asymmetrical shadows, highlighting the figures on the right more prominently. As the camera gradually pulls back into a full shot, a dynamic, white, web-like structure of particles emerges from the central person, expanding outward to momentarily obscure the faces of the surrounding figures before contracting and shooting upward. The misty atmosphere enhances the perception of depth, making the foreground figures appear sharper while softening the details of those in the midground, an effect that becomes more pronounced as the camera recedes.",
