    "pre_caption": "This is a medium shot of a woman and a man positioned in the foreground on the right side of the frame, inside what appears to be a hot air balloon basket. The woman is slightly in front of the man. In the middle ground, the large Pyramid of the Sun occupies the bottom-left quadrant. Two other hot air balloons are also in the middle ground: one is located in the center-right of the frame, and another is further away in the top-left. The expansive green landscape stretches across the bottom of the frame in the middle ground and background. The camera is held at the subjects' level. During the shot, the woman turns her head from looking toward the lower-left to face the camera, while the man turns his head from the camera to look toward the left side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned woman with long, dark brown hair is in the foreground, initially gazing toward the lower-left corner of the frame before turning to smile broadly at the camera. She is wearing a dark jacket and a patterned scarf around her neck. Standing behind her and to her right is a light-skinned man, who has his arm around her. He is wearing a blue jacket and a dark baseball cap, initially looking at the camera before shifting his gaze to his right, directing his attention toward the left side of the frame. They are positioned closely together in what appears to be the basket of a hot air balloon.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a selfie POV shot where the camera is held by the person being filmed, the scene unfolds from inside a hot air balloon basket high above the Teotihuacan archaeological site. The view is captured at sunrise, with the sun low on the horizon casting a warm glow across a hazy sky. Dominating the landscape below is the large, gray, stepped Pyramid of the Sun, set amidst a vast expanse of green terrain. Several other hot air balloons float in the air; one nearby features a red and white striped pattern, and another in the distance showcases a vibrant mix of dark purple, light purple, green, and blue. A smiling woman and a man are visible in the foreground within the basket.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects and background elements, it describes the scene as mostly static, which seems unlikely for a video shot from a moving hot air balloon. The critique is that it fails to capture the dynamic movement of the entire scene. For instance, the main balloon is likely drifting slowly from left to right, causing the Pyramid of the Sun to shift its position from the bottom-left quadrant gradually toward the bottom-center of the frame. The caption also misses the subtle, independent movements of the other three hot air balloons; the two in the upper-left are probably drifting away from the camera, becoming slightly smaller, while the one in the upper-center-right is ascending slowly. Furthermore, the description of the landscape is too general; it should differentiate between the textured fields in the middle ground that are scrolling past below and the static, hazy mountain range visible in the distant background. The description of the subjects' position on the \"right side\" could also be more precise, as I imagine them occupying the right third of the frame, with the woman positioned closer to the center than the man.",
