    "pre_caption": "In a static, low-angle full shot, two figures are framed in the middle ground. One figure stands to the left of the center, and the other stands to the right. A wicker basket is positioned in the bottom right of the frame, slightly in front of the figure on the right. The ocean and a wide sky occupy the background. Initially, both figures move their hands around their heads before becoming stationary for the remainder of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black and white scene, two figures stand on a sandy beach. The figure on the left wears a light-colored, long coat that reaches mid-calves, paired with dark shoes. The second figure, positioned in the center, is dressed in a dark suit jacket and trousers with dark shoes. The heads and faces of both figures are completely obscured by thin strands wrapped around them. They are both seen adjusting these head coverings before standing still. A large, dark, woven wicker basket sits on the sand in front of the second figure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a black and white, level-angle shot, two figures stand on a wide, sandy beach. The ocean extends from the midground to the horizon in the background under a bright sky with wispy clouds, and gentle waves roll onto the shore. The figures, silhouetted against the bright light, have their faces obscured by many strands. The person on the left wears a long coat, and the person on the right wears a dark suit. A large, dark wicker basket is positioned in the center right of the frame. The sun casts long, dark shadows of the figures and the basket across the sand.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the figures' positions as \"left of the center\" and \"center\" is somewhat ambiguous; clarifying their relationship to each other, such as \"standing side-by-side,\" would be more informative. The basket's location is described as both \"center-right\" and \"in front of the figure in the center,\" which is contradictory. It would be clearer to state its position relative to the frame and its depth, for example, \"a wicker basket sits in the right foreground.\" The term \"full shot\" might be inaccurate if the figures' feet are cut off by the bottom of the frame, in which case \"medium-long shot\" would be more precise. The action \"move their hands around their heads\" is vague; a more descriptive verb, if the action is clear, such as \"adjusting their hats\" or \"brushing hair from their faces,\" would provide more detail without being subjective. Finally, the description of the beach could be more specific, noting if the figures are standing near the water's edge in the middle ground, which would better establish the scene's depth.",
