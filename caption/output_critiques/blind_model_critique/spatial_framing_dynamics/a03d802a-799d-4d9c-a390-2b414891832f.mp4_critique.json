    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot, captured from a low-angle, forward-facing perspective, does not feature a main subject. The hood of the vehicle is positioned in the bottom foreground. A highway extends from the bottom of the frame into the center background, with its white lane lines appearing to converge in the distance. The rapid forward motion blurs the environment, stretching the overhead streetlights in the middle ground and background into long, yellow, horizontal streaks across the top of the frame. Other city and vehicle lights in the background are similarly blurred into streaks along the left, right, and center, creating a dynamic effect of the entire scene rushing from a central vanishing point in the background towards the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dynamic cityscape scenery shot from the dashcam perspective of a vehicle traveling at high speed down a multi-lane highway at night. The long-exposure photography technique blurs the surrounding environment, transforming the yellow overhead streetlights and distant city lights into long, horizontal streaks against a dark blue sky. The wet asphalt reflects these glowing trails, enhancing the sense of rapid motion. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the overall atmosphere and sensation of speed within the urban environment, using the flow of light and motion to create an abstract visual experience rather than highlighting a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera, capturing the scene ahead, shows a high-speed drive along a multi-lane highway at night. The rapid motion creates significant blur, stretching the bright yellow overhead streetlights and distant red taillights into long, horizontal streaks of light. The dark, glossy hood of the vehicle is visible at the bottom of the view, positioned above the dark, reflective pavement marked with blurred white lines. Along the sides of the road, indistinct city lights are smeared into colorful bands against a dark blue night sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the wide shot, level-angle perspective, and the general effect of motion blur, it could be more specific about the spatial composition and the characteristics of the light. For example, the description of the highway converging in the \"center background\" is plausible, but if the vehicle were in a side lane, the vanishing point would be off-center, a key detail affecting the scene's symmetry. The caption focuses on \"yellow, horizontal streaks\" from streetlights but misses the opportunity to describe a more complex light environment; it could specify the presence of red light streaks from taillights concentrated in the left background and white streaks from headlights or buildings on the right, which would provide a more detailed account of the spatial distribution of elements. Additionally, describing the light trails as simply \"horizontal\" is an oversimplification; they would likely appear shorter and more radial near the vanishing point, elongating and flattening towards the periphery of the frame. Mentioning the dark, featureless sky occupying the top of the frame would also add important context by highlighting the contrast that makes the light streaks prominent.",
