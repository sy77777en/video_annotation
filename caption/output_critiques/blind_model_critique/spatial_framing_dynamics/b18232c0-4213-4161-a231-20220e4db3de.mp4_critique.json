    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot, captured from a static, high-angle, top-down perspective, frames a large, multi-level traffic intersection that fills the scene. A circular roundabout is positioned in the center, with an underpass cutting diagonally through its middle ground from the top left to the bottom right, creating a lower level of traffic flow. Roads extend from the roundabout towards all corners and sides of the frame, surrounded by arid landscape in the periphery. Throughout the time-lapse, numerous cars move simultaneously on both levels: vehicles circulate counter-clockwise on the upper-level roundabout, while traffic on the lower level moves in two directions through the underpass.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This aerial, top-down video shows a large, multi-level road intersection. The primary feature is a circular roundabout with dark gray asphalt and white lane markings. One half of the roundabout is hollowed out, revealing an underpass beneath this section, allowing a lower level of traffic to pass through. Numerous cars, mostly white, black, and silver sedans and SUVs, are visible on both the roundabout and the underpass. A few yellow taxis and a white bus are also present. The central island of the roundabout is a landscaped area containing green trees, bushes, and a paved, light-colored square plaza. The surrounding terrain is arid and light brown, with some scattered trees.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A drone-filmed time-lapse video offers a top-down view of a bustling, multi-level traffic roundabout on a clear day, effectively showcasing distinct traffic flow patterns. Vehicles in various colors, including white, black, and yellow, circulate around the dark gray asphalt road encircling a landscaped central island, while others pass through a tunnel beneath. The central island features green trees, shrubs, light-colored paved walkways, and a square plaza at its core. Set in an arid urban environment with light brown, sandy ground and sparse vegetation, the video captures the dynamic movement of cars around the roundabout and through the underpass.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject and its general activity, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and visual details. The term \"bird's-eye view\" might be inaccurate; a true top-down perspective would flatten the scene, making it difficult to perceive the underpass as a distinct lower level. A \"very high-angle shot\" would be more likely, as this would create the sense of depth needed to see the underpass running beneath the central roundabout. The description of the underpass cutting \"diagonally downward from the upper part of the background\" is confusing because the rotating camera means the \"background\" is constantly shifting; it would be clearer to describe its path relative to the static roundabout, for instance, \"an underpass bisects the scene from the top-left to the bottom-right, passing beneath the roundabout.\" Furthermore, the caption misses the visual effect of the time-lapse on the vehicles, which likely appear as continuous streaks of white and red light rather than distinct cars, a key element of the shot's dynamic. The description of the camera's movement could also be enhanced by specifying the direction and extent of the rotation, such as a slow 90-degree clockwise pan that gradually brings different exit ramps into focus. Finally, the \"arid landscape\" could be described with more texture, perhaps noting patches of manicured green grass lining the roads, which contrasts with the surrounding brown, undeveloped land visible at the edges of the frame.",
