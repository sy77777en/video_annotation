    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle shot focused on a man's upper body in the lower-left foreground as he is on the ground. He pushes himself up, moving toward the center of the frame. As he does, a second man enters from the left, and the shot reframes into a medium shot with the camera now at the subjects' level. The two men then occupy the center of the frame in the middle ground, with the first man on the right and the second on the left. They move around this central space as they fight, positioned in front of the tiled walls and a white container visible in the background on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark hair, a mustache, and a goatee, dressed in a dark jacket, is initially seen on the ground before pushing himself up. As he gets to his feet, a second man, also with dark hair and wearing a dark jacket, enters the scene. The two men then engage in a physical fight, throwing punches at one another.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit, confined indoor space with light-colored, rectangular-tiled walls and a concrete floor. A hazy, yellowish-green light illuminates the room, which is filled with dust or smoke. In the background, a white container sits against the wall. Two men in dark clothing are engaged in a physical altercation within this enclosed area.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a man falling to the ground, with most of his body occupying the lower half of the frame. As he gets up, another person enters the frame from the left, and the video finally presents a medium shot of the two engaged in a fight.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the initial high-angle shot and the transition to a subject-level medium shot, it lacks detail regarding the spatial dynamics of the fight itself. The description of the men's final positions—one in the midground center and the other in the foreground left—presents a static snapshot rather than the continuous movement of a fight; for instance, it fails to mention how they grapple and exchange positions, with the second man pushing the first toward the white container in the right background, nearly knocking it over. The phrase 'move around this space' is too general and could be improved by describing their specific trajectory, such as them stumbling from the center towards the left side of the frame before the first man regains his footing and shoves the second back into the midground. Additionally, the camera's reframing could be more precisely described; for example, specifying that the camera tilts up and simultaneously pulls back to achieve the medium shot, which would better capture the dynamic shift in perspective as the first man rises to his feet.",
