    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured at the subject's level, a person is initially positioned in the middle ground, lying on a bed that occupies the lower half of the frame, extending from the center-left to the center-right. A pillow is in the left foreground. The person's red-haired head is in the center-left, with a small, glowing blue rectangle held near their eye. In the background, a bright window with a box fan on the sill is centered. The person then sits up, their upper body moving into a vertical orientation in the center of the frame, and the glowing rectangle is no longer visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with red-dyed hair is shown in a dark, black-and-white room. Initially, the person is lying in bed, propped up on an elbow, with a digital effect in the shape of a rectangular eye mask emitting a bright blue glow covering their eyes. The individual, silhouetted against a window, then sits up in bed. They are wearing a light-colored short-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and dark shoes or boots, with other features obscured by the darkness.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, monochromatic bedroom. In the middle ground, a silhouetted person with red-dyed hair lies on a bed before sitting up. A glowing cyan rectangular overlay is visible near their eye. In the background, a bright window with blinds is partially covered by curtains, and a box fan sits on the windowsill, also in silhouette against the light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the shot size as a \"full shot\" seems inaccurate, as the final action focuses on the person's \"upper body,\" suggesting a medium long or medium shot would be more precise. The description of the camera height as \"at the subject's level\" is also ambiguous; if the camera is static and level with the bed, it would be positioned *below* the subject's torso and head once they sit up, creating a slight low-angle shot in the final framing, a detail that is missed. Furthermore, placing the person and bed in the \"middle ground\" is spatially confusing, as elements occupying the bottom of the frame are typically perceived as being in the foreground; the bed and the person are more likely in the foreground, with the space between them and the back wall constituting the middle ground. The caption also misses an opportunity to describe the dynamics of the glowing rectangle's disappearance—whether it fades, blinks out, or is otherwise deactivated—which is a key visual event. Finally, the description of the movement could be more dynamic, specifying that the person moves not just into the center but also *upward* from the bottom of the frame as they transition from a horizontal to a vertical orientation.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium shot of a person lying on a bed in the foreground, which extends across the lower half of the frame. A pillow is visible in the left foreground. The person's red-haired head is positioned in the center-left, holding a small, glowing blue rectangle near their eye. In the background, a bright window with a box fan on the sill is centered. As the person sits up, their upper body moves upward and into a vertical orientation in the center of the frame, creating a slight low-angle shot. The glowing rectangle disappears, possibly fading or blinking out, as the person transitions from a horizontal to a vertical position.",
