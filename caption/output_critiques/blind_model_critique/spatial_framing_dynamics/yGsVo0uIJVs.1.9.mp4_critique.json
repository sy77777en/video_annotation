    "pre_caption": "A full shot presents a submarine positioned diagonally in the middle ground, extending from the upper left background to the lower right foreground. The vessel's stern is in the bottom right, with its conning tower situated in the center-left of the frame. The camera is positioned slightly above the submarine, looking down at its hull. The surrounding scene is filled with water and vertical light rays. The spatial composition remains static throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A submarine with a long hull is depicted submerged in water, with rays of light penetrating from above, casting a blue-green hue over the scene. The vessel is viewed from its rear quarter, showcasing its cylindrical body, a prominent conning tower rising from the top, and the tail section with horizontal and vertical stabilizers. The surface of the submarine's hull appears somewhat weathered or textured.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An elongated submarine is submerged in deep water. Shafts of turquoise-blue light pierce the surface from above, illuminating the water with vertical beams that shimmer across the vessel's hull. The submarine is viewed from the side and slightly from the rear, showing its long body, the conning tower rising from the top, and the horizontal and vertical stabilizers at the stern. The hull appears weathered or textured. An overlay in the bottom left corner reads \"[6];geographicus.com,\" and \";geographicus.com\" disappears later.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the submarine's orientation creates a contradiction. If the vessel extends from the upper left background to the lower right foreground, the part in the lower right is the bow, not the stern, as it is closest to the camera and leading the movement. The caption should clarify that the bow is in the foreground. The term \"shifts\" is also ambiguous; the change in the submarine's perceived angle from diagonal to horizontal is a direct result of the camera's perspective change as it moves downward and forward, not the submarine itself turning, and this cause-and-effect relationship is missing. Furthermore, the conning tower's position is described as static in the upper-left, but given the significant camera motion, its position within the frame would dynamically change, likely moving towards the center or top-center as the camera gets closer and tilts up. The initial \"full shot\" classification is incomplete because the camera's forward push-in effectively transforms it into a medium shot by the end, a key dynamic that is not mentioned. Lastly, the description of the light rays is static, whereas the video likely shows them sweeping across the submarine's hull as it moves, an important spatial interaction that would enhance the description.",

The conning tower starts in the center-left of the frame. As the camera moves downward and forward, the submarine's perceived angle shifts from diagonal to horizontal, transforming the shot into a medium shot. The conning tower dynamically moves towards the center or top-center of the frame. The surrounding scene is filled with water, and vertical light rays sweep across the submarine's hull, enhancing the visual interaction as the camera approaches.",
