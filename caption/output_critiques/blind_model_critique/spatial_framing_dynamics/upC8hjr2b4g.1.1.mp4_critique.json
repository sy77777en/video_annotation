    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a black SUV is initially positioned in the bottom center of the frame, occupying the middle ground on a cracked road. The road is flanked by two walls on the left and right sides of the frame. In the background, at the top of the frame, a large, closed gate is centered between two pillars. The two halves of the gate then swing open outwards. Following this, the SUV drives forward along the center of the road, moving from the middle ground into the background and passing through the now-open gate. The camera maintains its fixed, high-angle perspective throughout the entire sequence, observing the car as it recedes into the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high-angle perspective, a black Jeep SUV with a sunroof is positioned on a cracked, paved road. The entire scene is obscured by a thick, blue-tinted fog. The car faces a large, dark-colored gate made of vertical bars, which is set between two substantial pillars. The gate is part of a wall topped with barbed wire. The two sides of the gate swing open, and the car proceeds to drive forward through the opening.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows an outdoor scene on a cracked, pale concrete road flanked by tall, solid walls topped with barbed wire and metal gates. The environment is enveloped in dense, bluish-white fog, limiting visibility and muting colors throughout the setting. Initially, the gates are closed but open as a dark-colored car enters the frame and moves forward through the large, open gates. The ground surface is marked by visible cracks and faint lane lines, while the surrounding structures are made of smooth, light-colored stone or concrete with minimal ornamentation. The fog creates a diffused, low-contrast atmosphere, and no overlays or additional visual elements are present.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the walls is confusing; stating they are \"at the end and on the left and right sides\" and \"nearly invisible at the top\" is unclear. A more precise description would be that low walls line the road on the left and right, extending from the midground to the background where they meet the gate. The description of the camera movement and its effect on the subject is also indirect. Instead of saying the SUV \"moves into the foreground due to the camera movement,\" it would be more accurate to describe the visual change itself, such as \"the camera zooms in and tilts down, transitioning from a wide shot to a medium shot, which causes the SUV to fill the foreground.\" Furthermore, the initial entry of the SUV \"from the bottom center\" implies it appears in the middle of its journey; it would be clearer to state that it enters the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame and then drives away from the camera toward the gate in the background. Finally, describing the SUV's exit as moving \"from the foreground to the midground\" is incomplete; as it drives away down the road, it would more accurately be described as receding from the foreground, through the midground, and into the background until it is small in the distance.",
