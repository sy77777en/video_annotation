    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot from an underwater perspective, showing a person with dark hair in the center-right foreground as bubbles rise toward the top of the frame. In the top-left, another person's feet are visible in the water. The camera then moves upward to the water's surface, maintaining a medium shot at the subject's level. In the final framing, the person with dark hair is in the center middle ground with their head above water, while a woman sits on the pool's edge in the top-left middle ground, leaning forward. The background consists of dark windows and plants across the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a body of blue-lit water, a person with dark, curly hair is seen both underwater and at the surface. A woman with light-colored, straight hair and a light skin tone sits on the edge of the water, wearing a dark swimsuit. She leans forward, smiling down at the person in the water. The woman's feet, which have red-painted toenails, are visible submerged in the water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, in an indoor pool area, the scene is saturated in a deep blue light. The perspective shifts from an underwater view, where bubbles rise through the blue water, to a position at the water's surface. The surrounding space is dark, with large windows and potted plants visible in the background. A person is in the pool, and another is seated on the edge.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good chronological flow of the action, but it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and the dynamics of the movement. For instance, while it correctly identifies the person's feet in the top-left, it omits their depth, which I imagine are in the middle ground, creating a sense of distance from the main subject in the foreground. The description of the camera movement is accurate, but it should also note that the subject simultaneously moves upward through the water, and the camera's tilt is a direct response to follow this action. The final framing description is missing the depth of the subjects; the person who has surfaced is clearly in the foreground, while the woman on the pool's edge is in the middle ground. Furthermore, the caption fails to account for the person whose feet were initially visible; in the video I'm picturing, this person is now standing in the left middle ground, next to the seated woman, and this detail should be included to resolve their disappearance from the description. Finally, stating the camera is at the \"subject's level\" is only true for the final part of the shot; it begins at a low angle, looking up at the subject from below, before tilting up to meet their eye level as they surface.",
