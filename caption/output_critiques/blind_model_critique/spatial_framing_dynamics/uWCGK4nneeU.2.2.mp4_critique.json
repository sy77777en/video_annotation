    "pre_caption": "The shot begins from a high-elevation perspective, with metallic components of a vehicle occupying the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a vast desert landscape with rolling mountains stretches across the entire width of the scene. A large, single cloud is positioned in the center of the sky in the background, with three small aircraft flying in formation to its left and center. As the camera tilts upward, the foreground vehicle components move down and out of view, transitioning the scene into an extreme wide shot focused on the distant landscape and sky. The small aircraft continue to fly from left to right in the background, while bolts of lightning flash from the bottom of the central cloud down toward the desert floor in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially shows gray, metallic components of an aircraft's top at the bottom of the frame, which then move out of view. The scene reveals a large, white, fluffy cloud against a light blue sky. Flying in a loose formation near the cloud are three small, dark aircraft. A few bright, white bolts of lightning briefly flash, extending from the base of the cloud down toward the desert landscape below.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an elevated, wide-angle view of an expansive, arid desert landscape under a light blue sky. Rolling, sandy mountains with defined ridges and dark shadows stretch across the horizon. A single, large, puffy white cloud is positioned centrally in the sky, with several small, dark aircraft flying in formation nearby. During the sequence, multiple bolts of lightning flash down from the base of the cloud toward the desert floor.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera starts with the lower part showing a part of an airplane, and as the camera rises and tilts upward, the airplane leaves the frame, revealing an extreme wide shot of the scenery in the distance.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the camera movement and the dramatic elements of the lightning and aircraft. However, based on the video, the spatial description could be more precise. The \"metallic components\" in the foreground are clearly the hood of a moving off-road vehicle, and specifying this would add clarity. More importantly, the large, single cloud is located in the **background**, not the middle ground; it is the lightning from this background cloud that strikes the desert floor in the middle ground, and this distinction is critical for spatial accuracy. The initial shot is better described as a medium wide shot from a point-of-view perspective before it transitions. Lastly, while the caption notes the aircraft moving deeper into the background, it omits their 2D trajectory; they fly horizontally from the upper left toward the center of the frame as they recede.",
