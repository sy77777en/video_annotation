    "pre_caption": "This is a static, extreme wide shot of a cityscape. A large, reflective skyscraper is positioned in the foreground and middle ground, occupying the right half of the frame. In the middle ground, a cluster of white buildings and a reddish-brown quarry are visible in the bottom-left quadrant. A vast, hazy city stretches across the background, filling the space to the left of the skyscraper and extending to the distant hills. A digital overlay of lines and logos is superimposed over the entire scene in the absolute foreground. The camera is positioned at a high-angle aerial perspective, looking across the landscape from a height roughly level with the upper portion of the main skyscraper.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, dominated by a modern skyscraper with a dark, highly reflective glass facade that mirrors a distorted view of the urban surroundings. The building stands against a vast, hazy city that stretches into the distant hills, featuring a mix of residential towers and green spaces. To the left, a large, reddish-brown excavated area sits below several white apartment buildings, highlighting a contrast between development and raw landscape. There is no main subject because the composition is designed to capture the expansive scale and atmosphere of the urban environment, focusing on the interplay between architecture and the sprawling city rather than a specific person or object. A faint digital overlay of interconnected lines and logos is superimposed across the scene, adding a technological or data-driven aesthetic.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of a sprawling cityscape under a hazy sky. A prominent skyscraper with a dark, reflective glass facade occupies the right side of the scene, its surface mirroring a distorted view of the urban surroundings, including a green and white helipad. In the lower-left corner of the midground, a cluster of white high-rises is situated on a large, reddish-brown, terraced quarry. Numerous other buildings are visible throughout the scene, which is overlaid with a network of thin white lines connecting small, white 'M' logos.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main elements and the general camera motion, it describes the scene as a static composition rather than a dynamic one. The primary issue is the failure to explain how the \"camera moving downward\" affects the spatial framing. For instance, as the camera descends, the foreground skyscraper would not just occupy the right half but would appear to rise within the frame, altering its relationship with the background and potentially revealing more of the city behind it. The term \"extreme wide shot\" may also be inaccurate; if the skyscraper occupies half the frame, \"wide shot\" is more appropriate. Furthermore, the \"level aerial perspective\" is likely only the initial state; the downward movement would transition it to a high-angle shot relative to the elements below. The caption should integrate the motion into the description, detailing how the relative positions and prominence of the skyscraper, the middle-ground buildings, and the background city evolve throughout the descent. Lastly, calling the reddish-brown area a \"quarry\" could be an assumption, and describing the digital overlay's behavior (static or animated) would add necessary detail.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a dynamic wide shot of a cityscape. A large, reflective skyscraper initially occupies the right half of the frame, but as the camera moves downward, the skyscraper appears to rise within the frame, altering its relationship with the background and revealing more of the city behind it. In the middle ground, a cluster of white buildings and a reddish-brown area, possibly a quarry, are visible in the bottom-left quadrant. A vast, hazy city stretches across the background, filling the space to the left of the skyscraper and extending to the distant hills. A digital overlay of lines and logos is superimposed over the entire scene in the absolute foreground, though it remains static. The camera starts at a level aerial perspective, but the downward movement transitions it to a high-angle shot relative to the elements below, dynamically changing the spatial framing throughout the descent.",
