    "pre_caption": "The video features a skier captured in a full shot, positioned centrally within the frame. The skier is in the foreground, with snow-covered trees forming the background. The camera, held at the skier's level using a selfie stick, maintains a consistent angle as the skier moves dynamically through the scene. The skier's movement causes snow to spray, partially obscuring the view and adding a sense of motion. The trees, positioned in the background, frame the scene on both sides, enhancing the depth and creating a tunnel-like effect as the skier navigates through the snowy landscape. The camera remains steady, focusing on the skier's swift maneuvers and the surrounding environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person snowboarding through deep snow in a forested area. The snowboarder is wearing a gray ski hat and goggles, a blue jacket, and dark pants. They are captured from a selfie angle, likely using a selfie stick, as they navigate through snow-covered trees. The snowboarder is moving at a high speed, creating a spray of snow around them, which partially obscures the view. The scene conveys a sense of dynamic movement and skillful maneuvering through the snowy landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed on a long pole, captures a rapid descent through a dense, snow-covered forest. The camera faces the individual as they carve through deep powder, kicking up large clouds of white snow that occasionally obscure the view. The landscape is characterized by tall evergreen trees heavily laden with snow, set against a bright, overcast sky. The low-angle perspective looks up from the snowy ground toward the towering trees.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject and setting, it misrepresents the shot size and camera dynamics typical of this perspective. Describing it as a \"full shot\" is likely inaccurate; given the use of a selfie stick, the framing is more probably a medium or medium-full shot, capturing the snowboarder from the waist or knees up, with the board itself often out of frame or only partially visible. The statement that the camera \"remains steady\" is also questionable, as such footage invariably includes vibrations and bobbing motions that follow the snowboarder's movements, which is a key part of the spatial experience. The description of the snowboarder's movement could be more precise; rather than just moving \"through the scene,\" the entire frame is moving forward, causing the background trees to rush past the centrally-fixed subject. Furthermore, the caption omits the snowboarder's orientation—a crucial spatial detail—failing to mention that they are likely facing the camera. A more accurate description would note the dynamic camera shake, clarify the shot as a medium shot, and describe the forward motion of the entire frame through the landscape, with the snowboarder's body shifting side-to-side within this moving frame as they carve down the slope.",
