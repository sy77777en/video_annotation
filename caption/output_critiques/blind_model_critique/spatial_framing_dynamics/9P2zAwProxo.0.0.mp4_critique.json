    "pre_caption": "A man is featured in a medium shot, positioned in the center foreground of the frame. In the middle ground, another person is seen to the left of center, walking toward the camera. A snowmaking machine is located in the far-left middle ground. In the background, a large building and a parking lot are visible in the top right, with bare trees situated on both the left and right sides of the frame. The camera is held at the main subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with a beard and mustache stands in the foreground, looking toward the camera. He is wearing a black ski helmet and large, dark ski goggles that cover his eyes. His attire consists of a black jacket with white sleeves. In the midground, another person wearing a blue jacket and dark pants is seen walking toward the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed, captures a wide, snow-covered slope at a ski resort on an overcast day. In the background, a large, multi-story building with a black roof and red and light brown walls sits on a hill above a parking lot filled with cars. The landscape is dotted with bare trees, and the ground is almost entirely blanketed in white snow. To the left, a white and orange snowmaking machine is situated on the snow, and dark red structures with pointed tops stand nearby. Another person is visible in the distance on the snow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and elements, correctly placing them in the foreground, middle ground, and background. However, the description of the movement is incomplete. It states that a person is \"walking toward the camera\" but fails to describe the full trajectory of this action. For example, it doesn't specify if this person walks past the main subject, stops, or exits the frame, nor does it describe how their size and position within the frame change as they approach. Additionally, the description of the main subject as \"featured\" is passive; specifying his orientation, such as \"facing the camera\" or \"looking off-screen,\" would provide a more precise spatial description. The positioning of the parking lot as \"upper center\" is also somewhat ambiguous for such a large element; it would be clearer to state that it extends across the central portion of the frame from the middle ground backward. Finally, the spatial relationship between the trees and the snowmaking machine could be clarified, for instance, by noting if the machine is positioned in front of or between the trees on the left.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man is facing the camera in a medium shot, positioned in the center foreground of the frame. In the middle ground, another person is walking toward the camera from the left of center, gradually increasing in size as they approach.

A snowmaking machine is located in the far-left middle ground, positioned between the bare trees on the left side of the frame. In the background, a large building and a parking lot extend across the central portion of the frame from the middle ground backward, with bare trees situated on both the left and right sides of the frame.
