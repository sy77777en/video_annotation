    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot frames the head of an elephant in profile, positioned on the left side of the frame and extending toward the center. The elephant's head and its large, curved tusks, which stretch from the left toward the bottom right, occupy the foreground. In the background, the out-of-focus, bare branches of trees are visible at the top and right of the frame against a pale sky. Midway through the shot, the tip of the elephant's trunk enters the frame from the bottom, moves upward into the bottom-left foreground near its mouth, and then moves back down and out of view. The camera remains static and positioned at the elephant's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot shows the head of an elephant in profile, facing towards the right. Its brown skin is thick and covered in deep, intricate wrinkles. Two large, curved, white tusks with dark, worn patches extend from its mouth. The elephant's eye is visible, and midway through the video, the textured tip of its trunk curls up near its mouth before moving away again.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting under a pale, overcast sky, the scene provides a close-up profile of an elephant's head. The background is softly blurred, featuring the thin, bare branches of trees. The elephant's brown skin is deeply wrinkled and textured. Two long, curved, white tusks with dark, worn patches extend forward. The trunk lifts from below, curls upward, approaches the mouth, and then moves downward and out of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the initial framing is clear, but the explanation of the camera movement creates ambiguity. The caption states the camera \"pans to the right and tilts downward\" but fails to connect this movement to any action by the elephant, making it seem unmotivated. If the elephant were to lower or turn its head, the camera would likely follow, and this cause-and-effect relationship is missing. Furthermore, the caption neglects to describe the final framing after the camera movement concludes, leaving the viewer to guess if the composition has changed. The description of the tusks could also be improved by specifying that they emerge from the elephant's head in the foreground, rather than just stating they are also in the foreground as a separate element. Lastly, while the trunk's movement is noted, a more descriptive verb like \"curls\" instead of \"moves\" would better capture the nuance of the action, and the \"close-up\" shot size might be more accurately described as a \"medium close-up\" if it encompasses the entire head and the full curve of the tusks as implied.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium close-up shot frames the head of an elephant in profile, positioned on the left side of the frame and extending toward the center.

In the background, the out-of-focus, bare branches of trees are visible at the top and right of the frame against a pale sky. Midway through the shot, the tip of the elephant's trunk curls into the frame from the bottom, moves upward into the bottom-left foreground near its mouth, and then curls back down and out of view. The camera remains static and positioned at the elephant's level throughout the shot, maintaining the initial composition.",
