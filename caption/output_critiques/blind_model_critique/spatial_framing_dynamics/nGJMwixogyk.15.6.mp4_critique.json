    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing the entire stone staircase, the large red temple gate, and the surrounding plaza. People are dispersed across the frame, with some in the foreground at the bottom center and bottom left of the steps, others in the middle ground ascending or descending the stairs, and a few near the background at the top of the steps close to the gate. The temple gate occupies the upper center of the frame in the background, flanked by trees and a secondary structure to the right. Signs are positioned at the bottom center and bottom left of the steps in the foreground. The camera is positioned at approximately eye level with the people in the foreground, looking slightly upward toward the gate, which emphasizes the height and scale of the architecture. There is no significant camera movement or change in shot size; the spatial arrangement remains consistent, with people moving casually up and down the steps, creating dynamic but subtle shifts in their positions within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows several people of varying ages and genders walking or standing on wide stone steps leading up to a large, traditional Japanese temple gate with vivid red pillars and ornate architectural details. Among the people, there are women wearing short-sleeved shirts, men dressed in uniforms, and some individuals carrying bags or backpacks. The group is dispersed across the steps, with some ascending, some descending, and others briefly stopping. The people are generally facing toward or away from the temple gate, and their postures suggest casual movement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, shows an outdoor setting at the entrance of a traditional Japanese temple complex during daylight. The scene features wide stone steps leading up to a passageway, flanked by decorative lattice windows on both sides, set against a backdrop of dense green trees and a clear blue sky. The roof above is curved and tiled in black and white. The ground is paved with textured stone, and several signs with Japanese text and symbols are positioned near the base of the steps. A few people are walking or standing on the steps and open plaza, their placement adding scale to the architecture. The sunlight casts defined shadows, indicating a clear, bright day. No overlays such as text, icons, or watermarks are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the initial wide shot and the main elements like the temple, stairs, and crowd, it lacks specificity regarding the dynamic aspects of the shot. The description of the camera movement as \"continuously moves forward\" is too general; a more accurate description would be a handheld forward walk, creating a push-in effect that causes the temple to grow larger in the frame, and might also include a slight upward tilt to keep the temple's roof in view as the camera gets closer. Consequently, the caption misses the crucial transition of the shot size, which likely evolves from a wide shot to a medium-wide or medium shot of the temple entrance by the end of the video. The description of the crowd is also somewhat static; for instance, it could specify that a constant stream of people flows up the central staircase, making the scene feel more alive. Furthermore, the caption omits the camera's height, which appears to be at eye-level relative to the people in the plaza, positioning the viewer as a participant in the scene. Finally, the placement of the signage could be stated more clearly, such as \"two signs are positioned at the base of the stairs, one in the center and one on the right side of the frame.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing the entire stone staircase, the large red temple gate, and the surrounding plaza. The camera, held at eye level, moves forward in a handheld manner, creating a push-in effect that makes the temple grow larger in the frame. This movement includes a slight upward tilt to keep the temple's roof in view as the camera approaches. The shot transitions from a wide shot to a medium-wide or medium shot of the temple entrance by the end of the video. A constant stream of people flows up and down the central staircase, adding a dynamic and lively feel to the scene. The temple gate occupies the upper center of the frame, flanked by trees and a secondary structure to the right. Two signs are positioned at the base of the stairs, one in the center and one on the right side of the frame.
