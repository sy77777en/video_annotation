    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a young woman is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. To her left, a hanging decoration is situated in the foreground. In the background on the right side of the frame, a light-colored vertical structure is visible. The subject and the camera remain stationary throughout the shot, with the camera positioned at the woman's eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with fair skin, long dark brown hair, and light-colored eyes is shown in a close-up. Initially, her mouth is slightly agape, revealing her upper teeth, before she transitions into speaking and then closes her mouth. Her eyes are wide as she looks off-camera with an expression of alarm or surprise. The focus is tightly on her face, capturing her reaction in a dimly lit setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a hanging decoration is visible on the left, composed of a string of white, brush-like objects and a pink, fuzzy pom-pom. The background is mostly dark, with a light-colored vertical structure, resembling a door frame, on the right side of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by identifying the shot size, subject position, and key background elements. However, it could be more precise about the framing and depth. The term \"close-up\" is general; if the shot includes her neck and shoulders, \"medium close-up\" would be more accurate, and the description should mention that the top of her head is slightly cropped by the upper edge of the frame. A crucial missing detail is the shallow depth of field, which is typical for such a shot; the caption should state that the hanging decoration and the vertical structure are out of focus, which spatially isolates the subject in the foreground. The description of the decoration's placement, \"To her right behind her,\" could be refined to the clearer \"in the middle ground, over her right shoulder.\" Furthermore, \"light-colored vertical structure\" is vague; imagining it as the edge of a door frame, the caption could specify it as \"the out-of-focus edge of a white door frame in the background.\" Lastly, while her mouth movement is noted, the description of her as \"stationary\" might be an oversimplification; even in a static shot, a subject often makes subtle movements, and the caption could be improved by noting if she, for example, slightly tilts her head to the right as she speaks.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a medium close-up shot, a young woman is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The top of her head is slightly cropped by the upper edge of the frame. Over her right shoulder in the middle ground, a hanging decoration is visible, while in the background, the out-of-focus edge of a white door frame can be seen. The shallow depth of field isolates the subject, keeping her in sharp focus while the decoration and door frame are blurred. Although the camera remains at the woman's eye level, she subtly tilts her head to the right as she speaks, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise stationary shot.",
