    "pre_caption": "The video is presented in a static split-screen format. On the left side of the frame, a close-up shot captures a man in the foreground, positioned centrally within this section. Behind him, an out-of-focus, dimly lit scene occupies the background. The right side of the frame is dedicated to a graphical overlay in the foreground, which features a vertical money ladder centered within this panel. The £4,000 level is highlighted in the middle of this list. At the top of the right panel, three lifeline icons are displayed, while a text overlay identifying the program is situated in the top-left corner of the entire frame. The camera is positioned at the man's level, and there are no changes in framing or camera position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is presented in a split-screen format. On the left, a close-up shows a middle-aged, fair-skinned man with short, thinning brown hair. He is wearing a light blue polo shirt with a dark-colored collar and is looking down with a tense expression. On the right side of the screen, a graphic displays a vertical list of monetary values, a \"money ladder,\" ranging from £100 to £1 MILLION. The level for £4,000 is highlighted with an orange box and dark numbers. At the top of this graphic, one \"50:50\" lifeline icon is shown as available, while two other lifeline icons are crossed out with red 'X's.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a broadcast-style viewpoint used in television production, showcasing an indoor scene from a television game show. On the left, a man is visible against a dimly lit, out-of-focus background in purple tones with some indistinct figures. The right side of the screen features a graphical overlay displaying a vertical \"money tree\" with 15 prize levels, ranging from £100 to £1 MILLION in orange text, accompanied by their respective numbers on a dark background with blue and white radial blurry lines. The £1,000, £32,000, and £1 MILLION levels and their corresponding numbers are shown in off-white. The rank below £4,000 features a light blue diamond pattern between the amount and the number. The £4,000 level is highlighted by an orange horizontal bar, with the £4,000 text in dark color and its number in off-white. Above the money tree, three circular icons are shown; one for \"50:50\" and two others crossed out with a red \"X\". A text overlay in the top-left corner identifies the program as \"ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2001)\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: A TV program displays a split screen: the left side shows a close-up of a man, while the right side presents a numerical ranking list.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the static split-screen format and the man's close-up, it misses several key spatial details and dynamics. The description of the man as \"positioned centrally\" is inaccurate; he is framed slightly to the left within his panel, creating looking room to the right, presumably towards an off-screen host or monitor. The caption also omits the most crucial element of the right-hand panel: the text of the current question and four multiple-choice answers, which are displayed in the center of that panel, with the money ladder positioned to its right. Furthermore, the statement of \"no changes\" is an oversimplification. Although the camera is static, the man leans forward slightly, causing the shot to tighten from a close-up to an extreme close-up of his face. Concurrently, the highlighted £4,000 on the money ladder has a subtle, slow pulsing glow, representing a minor but present dynamic within the graphic. Finally, the program title overlay is not in the top-left of the entire frame, as this would obstruct the view of the man; it is instead situated in the top-left corner of the right-hand graphical panel, above the lifelines.",
