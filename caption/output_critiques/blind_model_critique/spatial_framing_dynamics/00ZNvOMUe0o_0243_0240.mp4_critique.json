    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot, captured from a high-angle perspective, frames a red off-road vehicle in the bottom-left quadrant of the frame, situated in the middle ground of a vast, arid landscape. A dirt track originates in the foreground at the bottom left, where the front of a second vehicle is partially visible, and extends into the background toward a distant mountain range on the horizon. The red vehicle moves backward along the track, shifting from the middle ground toward the foreground and moving closer to the bottom-left corner of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a red, two-door off-road vehicle, resembling a Jeep Wrangler, shown from a high-angle rear view. It is equipped with a silver or white roof rack and has a spare tire mounted on the back. In the lower-left corner, the front portion of a second, dark-colored vehicle is partially visible, also featuring a roof rack. The red vehicle is positioned further along a dirt path than the partially seen vehicle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an expansive, arid landscape during the day under a partly cloudy, blue sky. The vast, flat terrain is brown and covered with sparse, low-lying shrubs. A light brown dirt track with visible tire ruts winds through the foreground before stretching toward a distant mountain range on the horizon, which has some snow on its peaks. A red, boxy off-road vehicle with a white roof rack is reversing along this track, moving closer to the camera. The front of another vehicle is partially visible in the bottom left, also reversing toward the camera.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject, angle, and general movement, it lacks precision regarding key spatial and dynamic elements. The description of the \"second vehicle\" is too vague; the video clearly shows the dark hood and windshield of the camera vehicle in the immediate foreground, which acts as a framing device and establishes a distinct point-of-view. The caption also understates the dynamic impact of the red vehicle's movement; it should specify that the vehicle grows significantly larger in the frame as it reverses from the middle ground, a crucial detail illustrating the change in depth. Furthermore, the dirt track is not just an element but a strong diagonal leading line that cuts from the bottom-left foreground toward the center-right background, guiding the viewer's eye and defining the vehicle's path. Finally, the description omits the prominent cloud of dust kicked up by the red vehicle, a key visual that emphasizes its motion and interaction with the arid environment.",
