    "pre_caption": "The video begins as a medium shot with a woman in the center foreground, standing on a gravel path. In the left foreground, a black bollard and a small fence are visible. A decorative stone railing extends across the middle ground behind her, with a large replica of the Eiffel Tower positioned in the center background and large buildings to its right. The camera then zooms out to a medium full shot, revealing the woman from the knees up and bringing a red and black backpack into view in the bottom-left foreground. Throughout the shot, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young adult woman with fair skin and dark hair styled in a ponytail is the central subject. She wears a white, long-sleeved blouse with billowy sleeves, a black high-waisted wrap skirt with a white and light blue pattern at the hem, a dark, cord-like necklace with a pendant, and a pair of black and white drop earrings. Throughout the video, she maintains an expressive, open-mouthed smile while looking toward the camera. She stands in a dynamic, dance-like pose with her arms outstretched, one hand reaching forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is set during the day at The Parisian Macao under an overcast sky. A large, grey, steel lattice replica of the Eiffel Tower stands prominently in the background, with large, tan-colored hotel buildings positioned behind and to the right of it. In the foreground, a woman wearing a white blouse and a black skirt gestures towards the camera. She stands on a gravel path next to a decorative, carved stone railing with a quatrefoil pattern. Green shrubbery, a black bollard, and a bamboo fence are positioned near the railing. As the camera zooms out, a black and red backpack and a concrete slab become visible in the lower-left corner of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject, the zoom-out, and the key background elements, but it could be more precise with its spatial descriptions and dynamics. The phrasing \"lower-left corner of the midground\" is confusing; it would be clearer to state that the bollard is in the lower-left of the frame and positioned in the midground. Similarly, the backpack that is revealed would likely be in the foreground with the woman, not the midground, if it's close to her. The description also misses the opportunity to detail how the framing of the background elements, such as the Eiffel Tower, changes during the zoom-out; its position relative to the top of the frame would likely shift. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention any action from the woman herself; for instance, she might turn her head slightly toward the camera as it zooms out, a small but important dynamic. Finally, stating the camera is at \"the subject's level\" throughout the zoom might be an oversimplification, as a slight upward tilt often accompanies a zoom-out to maintain headroom and compositional balance, a detail that would enhance the description's accuracy.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium shot of a woman standing on a gravel path in the center foreground. In the lower-left of the frame, a black bollard is positioned in the midground, alongside a small fence. Behind her, a decorative stone railing stretches across the scene, with a large replica of the Eiffel Tower prominently placed in the center background, flanked by large buildings to its right. As the camera zooms out to a medium full shot, the woman is revealed from the knees up, and a red and black backpack appears in the foreground near her. During the zoom-out, the Eiffel Tower's position shifts slightly upward in the frame, maintaining compositional balance. The woman subtly turns her head toward the camera, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The camera maintains a slight upward tilt throughout the zoom to preserve headroom and compositional harmony.",
