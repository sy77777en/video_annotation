    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot presented as a static extreme wide shot. From a high-angle, top-down perspective, the camera captures an architectural model of an urban development that fills the entire frame. A grid of gray roads runs diagonally and horizontally, sectioning the scene. In the top left quadrant, a large U-shaped building complex is positioned next to an irregular black shape. Various other rectangular and L-shaped buildings are distributed across the center, right, and bottom portions of the frame, interspersed with clusters of green trees. Another black shape is located in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a high-angle shot of a minimalist architectural model depicting a cityscape. The scene is characterized by a grid of gray roads intersecting a pale gray landscape, upon which uniformly designed white, multi-story buildings with grid-like facades are arranged in rectangular and L-shaped configurations. Clusters of small, dark green model trees are interspersed between the structures and on some flat rooftops, providing a natural contrast to the stark, geometric architecture, while a few abstract, solid black shapes are also present on the ground. There is no main subject, as the composition emphasizes the overall urban planning concept, focusing on the scale, layout, and relationship between the built environment and green spaces rather than any single element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, top-down perspective, the scene depicts an architectural model of an urban development. The layout is set on a flat, light gray surface, with a grid of darker gray, textured roads defining the blocks. Numerous white, multi-story buildings with grid-like facades are arranged in rectangular, L-shaped, and U-shaped configurations. Clusters of miniature green trees are situated in open spaces between the buildings and on some of the flat rooftops. Several large, irregular black shapes are also visible on the ground, appearing as voids within the planned environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the high-angle, top-down perspective and the subject as an architectural model, it misses the crucial dynamic element of the shot. The video is not static; it features a slow, subtle zoom-in that starts as an extreme wide shot and gradually transitions to a wide shot, focusing more on the central cluster of buildings. This movement causes the elements at the far corners to slowly exit the frame. The description of \"irregular black shapes\" is too ambiguous; the video clearly shows these are representations of water, identifiable by their glossy texture which reflects light differently than the matte finish of the buildings and roads. Additionally, the caption fails to mention a prominent, taller cylindrical building located in the center-right of the frame that acts as a clear focal point, distinguishing it from the other \"rectangular and L-shaped buildings.\" The description of the roads as a simple \"grid\" is also an oversimplification, as the video shows a hierarchy with wider main avenues and narrower secondary streets.",
