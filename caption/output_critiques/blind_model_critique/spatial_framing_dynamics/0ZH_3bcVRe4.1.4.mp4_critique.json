    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, positioning the main subject in a cap and goggles in the left foreground, shown in profile. In the middle ground, two other men are positioned, one in the center and one on the right, walking from the right side of the frame toward the left. A stainless steel counter is visible in the center middle ground, with a vent hood and spraying water in the background. As the two men in the middle ground walk past and move to the far left, the main subject in the foreground turns his head slightly toward the camera. The shot simultaneously tightens into a medium close-up, focusing more closely on the main subject from the chest up. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a man in the foreground with medium-length light-colored hair, wearing a silver jacket, a black cap, and large, dark goggles. He is initially seen in profile, facing two men in the middle ground. The second man has short dark hair and is wearing a light-colored, uniform-style shirt with a name tag. The third man, with dark, styled hair, a beard, and sideburns, is dressed in a dark jacket with a wide collar and follows the second man, walking toward the left of the frame from the right. The main subject then turns to face more toward the camera after the other two men move to the far left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within an evenly lit, industrial kitchen with a distinct blue-green color cast. Stainless steel counters and shelves hold stacks of white plates and various containers. In the midground, a large vent hood is visible, with water spraying down from a sprinkler system and steam rising nearby. The walls appear to be tiled, contributing to the sterile and cold appearance of the room. Three figures are present in the kitchen, with two walking from right to left, passing by the third figure.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption captures the basic actions, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and element relationships. The description of the two men's framing change from \"medium close-up\" to \"full bodies visible\" is confusing; it would be clearer to describe their continuous movement, stating that they start in the right middle ground, become larger as they walk toward the foreground plane, and then shrink as they recede into the left midground. The caption says the main subject \"shifts to the center-right,\" which is ambiguous; it should clarify if the camera pans to follow him or if he physically moves across a static frame. The description of the environment is also slightly disjointed. Instead of listing the counter and water separately, their relationship could be integrated, for example, by describing the water as spraying from a nozzle over the stainless steel counter. This would create a more cohesive picture of the scene's depth and composition.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a medium shot, featuring the main subject in a cap and goggles positioned in the left foreground, shown in profile. In the middle ground, two other men start on the right side of the frame and walk toward the left, moving from the right middle ground to the foreground plane, and then receding into the left midground. A stainless steel counter is centrally located, with water spraying from a nozzle above it, creating a cohesive backdrop. As the two men continue their movement, the main subject in the foreground turns his head slightly toward the camera. The shot tightens into a medium close-up, focusing more closely on the main subject from the chest up. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the scene, maintaining a static frame as the main subject subtly shifts his position.",
