    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot, with the camera positioned high above the scene. A person carrying a bicycle is in the middle ground, located slightly left of the frame's center, ascending a large, steep hill that occupies the foreground and middle ground on the right side. A vast, arid landscape is visible in the background to the left, under a cloudy sky at the top of the frame. As the person climbs upward and toward the right, the camera moves closer and repositions itself, transitioning the shot into a wide shot. The camera's final position is below the subject, creating a low-angle view that shows the person silhouetted against the sky as they move toward the top center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a red shirt and red pants is seen climbing a steep, sandy hill. The individual is carrying a bicycle directly on their shoulders while walking on sand dunes, with a black backpack on their back as they make their way up the incline.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a vast, arid landscape during sunrise or sunset, with the low sun casting long shadows and a warm, golden light. The scene is dominated by a steep, barren hillside of brown earth in the foreground. In the distance, a wide expanse of rolling hills and valleys stretches to the horizon under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. A person wearing red pants and carrying a bicycle on their back is seen ascending the steep slope of the foreground hill. Sparse, low-lying green vegetation is visible in the lower elevations of the landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to below the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the initial extreme wide shot and the subject's action, but it contains a significant contradiction and could be more precise in its spatial descriptions. The final shot is described as a \"level-angle view\" while also stating the camera is \"below the subject\"; a camera positioned below the subject creates a low-angle shot, not a level-angle one, and this low angle is what logically produces the silhouetted effect mentioned. The description of the camera's movement as it \"moves closer and repositions itself\" is vague; it would be more descriptive to specify the nature of this movement, such as a continuous descent and pan that follows the subject's ascent, which would better convey the dynamic shift in perspective from a high-angle overview to a low-angle tracking shot. Furthermore, while the person is correctly placed left of center, the caption could better integrate their position with the environment by stating they are on the slope of the hill that occupies the right side, clarifying their spatial relationship to the dominant landform. Finally, the transition from an extreme wide shot to a wide shot could be clarified as a continuous camera push-in rather than an implied cut, which would better reflect the fluid motion described.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, with the camera positioned high above the scene. A person carrying a bicycle is slightly left of center, ascending the slope of a large, steep hill that dominates the right side of the frame. In the background to the left, a vast, arid landscape stretches under a cloudy sky at the top of the frame. As the person climbs upward and toward the right, the camera continuously descends and pans, smoothly transitioning into a wide shot. This dynamic movement shifts the perspective from a high-angle overview to a low-angle tracking shot. The camera's final position is below the subject, creating a low-angle view that silhouettes the person against the sky as they move toward the top center of the frame.",
