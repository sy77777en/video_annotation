    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The background is out of focus, showing a wall and a portion of a dark piece of furniture in the top right. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the shot. The woman, initially looking upward, closes her eyes and tilts her head back slightly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with light brown skin and long, voluminous, curly hair with blonde highlights is shown in a close-up. She is wearing a white, textured top. Initially, she looks upward with her light-colored eyes open and a neutral expression. She then closes her eyes and tilts her head back slightly.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a flickeringly lit room with a plain wall and wooden flooring, a young woman with curly hair is seen from above her shoulder. The background is out of focus, showing a glimpse of a dark-colored piece of furniture and a rug. The woman looks upward before slowly closing her eyes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundational description, but it misses some key nuances in the spatial composition and movement. While it identifies the shot as a close-up, it's more specifically a medium close-up, as the woman's shoulders are visible in the bottom of the frame. Her position is not perfectly centered; she is framed slightly to the left, which gives more breathing room to the dark wooden headboard that occupies the middle ground on the right. The description of her movement lacks detail on its effect on the framing; as she tilts her head back, her chin moves from the center towards the upper center of the frame, and her hair, initially resting on her shoulders, falls back, altering the shape of her silhouette against the background. Furthermore, the caption overlooks the lighting; a distinct key light from the top left casts soft shadows across the right side of her face and neck, which helps to sculpt her features and create a clearer separation from the blurred background wall.",
