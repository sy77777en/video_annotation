    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a person in a black suit positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of a futuristic arena. The surrounding arena walls and a circular blue light are visible in the background, while a patterned floor occupies the foreground and middle ground. The person, initially in a low crouch, turns toward the camera to catch a disc. As they do, the shot cuts to a medium shot, reframing the subject from the waist up while they remain in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person is shown in an athletic stance, wearing a form-fitting, full-body black suit and a matching black helmet that completely covers their head. The suit is detailed with glowing orange lights on the chest, arms, and legs. The helmet has a dark, reflective texture, and a small, glowing blue reflection of light can be seen on the forehead. The person holds a white, circular disc with glowing orange sections and catches another one from outside of the frame later in the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dark, futuristic indoor arena characterized by its geometric, angular architecture. The environment is constructed from dark, reflective materials, with all surfaces and structures outlined by glowing cyan lines. The floor features a similar reflective quality with a visible pattern, which can only be partially seen in the frame, but is likely a hexagonal shape. In the upper background, a row of bright white stadium-style lights can be seen as a reflection on the wall. A figure in a black suit with glowing orange details is positioned on the arena floor. A circular, blue light containing arrows around it is positioned on the wall at the top center of the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively outlines the sequence of events, it could be more precise in its description of spatial dynamics and contains a likely inaccuracy. The statement that the camera remains at the subject's level \"throughout the sequence\" is questionable; when the subject lands in a crouch after the tumble, a fixed camera would be positioned above them, creating a high-angle shot, before returning to their level in the final medium shot. The description of the \"aerial tumble\" could also be enhanced by specifying the direction of movement, such as tumbling forward from the middle ground toward the foreground, which would add a layer of depth to the action. Furthermore, the caption could clarify the spatial origin of the second disc, for instance, stating it is thrown from off-screen right. Finally, the phrase \"shift to the center of the frame and the foreground\" is slightly ambiguous; it would be clearer to state that the cut to the medium shot is what reframes the subject in the center-foreground, rather than implying it's a separate action performed by the subject after the cut.",
