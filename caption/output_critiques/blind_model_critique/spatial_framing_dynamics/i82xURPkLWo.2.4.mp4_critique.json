    "pre_caption": "The video uses a close-up shot, framing the man’s torso and hands as the main subject, with his arms and the objects he holds occupying the center and lower center of the frame in the foreground. The man’s hands, holding a photograph and a lighter, are positioned just above a round metallic bowl filled with ash, which sits on a wooden railing at the bottom center of the frame in the foreground. The photograph, initially held above the bowl, is set on fire with the lighter, and then dropped directly downward into the bowl, remaining in the foreground and center of the frame throughout the action. The camera remains at the same height as the man’s hands and the bowl, maintaining a level perspective. The background, which is softly blurred, occupies the upper part of the frame and remains in the background, showing indistinct outdoor scenery with no major elements drawing focus away from the central action. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera angle, and the spatial dynamics are defined by the downward movement of the photograph from the man’s hand into the bowl.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a medium skin tone, wearing a maroon t-shirt and dark blue jeans with a black belt, holds a rectangular photograph over a round, metallic bowl filled with gray ash. Using a lit, black, flip-top lighter in his right hand, he sets the bottom of the photograph on fire. The photo is a headshot of an older, light-skinned man with a bald head and a slight smile, wearing a white collared shirt. The man then drops the burning photograph into the bowl.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit outdoor setting on a wooden deck, a person holds a rectangular photograph of an older, bald man over a metallic, bronze-colored bowl. The bowl, filled with grey ash, sits on a light-colored wooden railing. Using a black flip-top lighter, the person ignites the bottom of the photograph. The flame spreads across the paper before the person releases the burning photo into the bowl. The background is softly blurred, showing an indistinct natural environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the core action, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and composition. The description of the \"man's torso\" might be an overstatement for a close-up; if only his forearms are clearly visible, specifying this would be more accurate. The caption completely omits the movement of the lighter, which would likely be brought up from a lower position to meet the photograph in the center of the frame before being moved away, representing a key spatial interaction that initiates the main event. Furthermore, the flame itself becomes a new, dynamic element, originating on the photograph and growing as the photo descends, yet its presence and movement are not described. The description of the background as \"indistinct outdoor scenery\" is too vague; even when blurred, there might be discernible elements like \"soft-focused green foliage and a pale sky\" that would provide more context. Finally, while the photograph's movement is noted as \"downward,\" the caption could better articulate this as a clear vertical shift from the upper-center of the frame to the bottom-center, emphasizing the change in its position along the Y-axis within the static shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a close-up shot focusing on the man's forearms and hands, which are the main subjects. His hands, holding a photograph and a lighter, are positioned above a round metallic bowl filled with ash, resting on a wooden railing at the bottom center of the frame. The lighter is brought up from a lower position to ignite the photograph in the center of the frame, before being moved away. The flame becomes a dynamic element, growing as the photograph descends vertically from the upper-center to the bottom-center of the frame, landing in the bowl. The camera maintains a level perspective with the man's hands and the bowl. The softly blurred background, featuring soft-focused green foliage and a pale sky, occupies the upper part of the frame, providing context without drawing attention away from the central action. The shot size and camera angle remain constant, with the spatial dynamics highlighted by the vertical movement of the photograph along the Y-axis.",
