    "pre_caption": "The video uses a close-up shot, framing the man’s torso and hands as the main subject, with his arms and the objects he holds occupying the center and lower center of the frame in the foreground. The man’s hands, holding a photograph and a lighter, are positioned just above a round metallic bowl filled with ash, which sits on a wooden railing at the bottom center of the frame in the foreground. The photograph, initially held above the bowl, is set on fire with the lighter, and then dropped directly downward into the bowl, remaining in the foreground and center of the frame throughout the action. The camera remains at the same height as the man’s hands and the bowl, maintaining a level perspective. The background, which is softly blurred, occupies the upper part of the frame and remains in the background, showing indistinct outdoor scenery with no major elements drawing focus away from the central action. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera angle, and the spatial dynamics are defined by the downward movement of the photograph from the man’s hand into the bowl.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a medium skin tone, wearing a maroon t-shirt and dark blue jeans with a black belt, holds a rectangular photograph over a round, metallic bowl filled with gray ash. Using a lit, black, flip-top lighter in his right hand, he sets the bottom of the photograph on fire. The photo is a headshot of an older, light-skinned man with short black hair and a slight smile, wearing a white collared shirt. The man then drops the burning photograph into the bowl.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit outdoor setting on a wooden deck, a person holds a rectangular photograph of an older, bald man over a metallic, bronze-colored bowl. The bowl, filled with grey ash, sits on a light-colored wooden railing. Using a black flip-top lighter, the person ignites the bottom of the photograph. The flame spreads across the paper before the person releases the burning photo into the bowl. The background is softly blurred, showing an indistinct natural environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the camera position is contradictory, stating it is both at \"eye level\" and a \"high-angle perspective\"; it should be clarified as a high-angle shot looking down onto the hands, as the man's face is not visible. The description of the action is too simplistic and misses key spatial dynamics. For instance, it fails to mention the movement of the hand holding the lighter as it approaches the photograph, the appearance of the flame as a new element in the center of the frame, and the subsequent retraction of that hand. Furthermore, the caption neglects to describe the physical transformation of the photograph as it burns—it would likely curl and blacken, with the image distorting and disappearing before being dropped, which is a significant spatial change of an element within the frame. The description of the background as \"indistinct outdoor scenery\" could be improved by noting the blurred colors, such as greens and browns suggesting foliage, which would add more texture. Lastly, while the caption states there are no changes in shot size, a subtle, slow push-in on the bowl as the burning photograph falls into it would be a common technique to emphasize the finality of the action, and this potential micro-dynamic is not considered.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a high-angle shot focusing on the man's torso and hands, with his arms and the objects he holds prominently in the center and lower center of the frame. The man's hands, holding a photograph and a lighter, are positioned above a round metallic bowl filled with ash, resting on a wooden railing at the bottom center of the frame. The action begins as the hand holding the lighter moves towards the photograph, introducing a flame that becomes a new focal point in the center of the frame. As the photograph ignites, it curls and blackens, with the image distorting and disappearing before being dropped into the bowl, marking a significant spatial transformation. The camera maintains a high-angle perspective, looking down onto the hands and bowl, with the background softly blurred, featuring hints of greens and browns that suggest foliage. This adds texture without distracting from the central action. Although the shot size remains largely consistent, there is a subtle, slow push-in on the bowl as the burning photograph falls, emphasizing the finality of the action.",
