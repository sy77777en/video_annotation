    "pre_caption": "A full shot frames a police car positioned centrally in the middle ground, angled slightly toward the left. The dark silhouette of another vehicle occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the background, a building with lit windows is visible on the left, along with another parked car further back. A street light pole stands to the left of the police car. The camera remains static at the car's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black-and-white police car, a sedan model, is parked on a street at night. The front and rear of the car are black, while the middle section, including the doors, is white. On the front door, the word \"POLICE\" is written in large, black, capital letters above the number \"113000\". A small American flag decal is visible on the front fender. The car is equipped with a red light bar on the roof, two antennas, and a push bar on the front bumper. Seated in the driver's seat is a blue, glowing, translucent humanoid figure. The text in the video is all in white, with the timestamp \"2:30 AM August 16th 1975\" at the bottom left corner and \"Granger, Salt Lake City, Utah\" at the bottom right corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night in Granger, Salt Lake City, Utah, a vintage black-and-white police car is parked on a paved street. The sedan features \"POLICE\" and the number \"113000\" in black lettering on its white side doors, along with a single red light on the roof and a push bumper. A blue, silhouetted figure is visible in the driver's seat. The scene is dark and hazy, with a building illuminated by interior lights visible in the background. Overlay text in white at the bottom left corner reads \"2:30 AM August 16th, 1975,\" while text at the bottom right corner reads \"Granger, Salt Lake City, Utah.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects and their initial positions, it misses key dynamic aspects of the video. It fails to mention the police car's flashing red and blue lights, a dominant visual element. More importantly, while it describes the complex camera movement—a forward and rightward motion with a left pan—it does not explain the resulting changes in spatial framing. For instance, it should specify that this movement causes the foreground vehicle silhouette to quickly exit the frame to the left, and the police car, initially central, shifts towards the right side of the frame by the end of the shot. This movement also creates a noticeable parallax effect, where the street light pole moves from the left of the police car to a position behind it. Finally, the description of a \"full shot\" is static; it should note that the shot transitions towards a medium shot as the camera advances, and it omits the camera's height, which appears to be at a low angle from within another vehicle.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a low-angle shot from within another vehicle, capturing a police car centrally positioned in the middle ground, angled slightly toward the left. The police car's flashing red and blue lights dominate the scene. In the foreground, the dark silhouette of another vehicle is visible at the bottom of the frame. The background features a building with lit windows on the left and another parked car further back. A street light pole stands to the left of the police car. As the camera moves forward and right while panning left, the foreground vehicle silhouette quickly exits the frame to the left. This dynamic movement shifts the police car from the center to the right side of the frame by the end of the shot, creating a noticeable parallax effect where the street light pole moves from the left of the police car to a position behind it. The shot transitions from a full shot to a medium shot as the camera advances.",
