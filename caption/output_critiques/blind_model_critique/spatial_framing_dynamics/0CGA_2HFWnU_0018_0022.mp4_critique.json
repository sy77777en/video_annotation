    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot captured in an extreme wide shot from a high-angle aerial perspective. Initially, the foreground across the bottom of the frame is filled with low-rise residential buildings and trees. In the middle ground, a white apartment building stands in the center, with the downtown skyline of skyscrapers situated behind it, stretching across the middle of the frame. A body of water is visible to the left. The background is dominated by a mountain range that extends across the upper portion of the frame, beneath a partly cloudy sky at the top. The camera slowly ascends, causing the foreground elements to move toward the bottom edge of the frame, revealing more of the urban landscape while the middle ground and background elements maintain their relative positions from an increasingly elevated viewpoint.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features an extreme wide shot of a cityscape, with the camera moving upward to reveal the sprawling urban landscape nestled against a backdrop of majestic mountains. In the foreground, a mix of low-rise residential buildings and lush green trees transitions to a dense cluster of downtown skyscrapers in the mid-ground, with a body of water and a bridge visible to the left. The distant mountains, some with snow-capped peaks, rise under a partly cloudy blue sky. The composition emphasizes the vast scale of the city and its stunning natural setting, focusing on the overall environment and atmosphere rather than any single element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an extreme wide aerial view of the Vancouver cityscape on a clear day, with the camera moving upward. In the background, a prominent mountain range with snow-capped peaks rises behind the dense downtown core, which is filled with numerous skyscrapers. A body of water is visible to the left of the city center. The foreground is composed of lower-rise residential buildings and abundant green trees, with a white, multi-story apartment building with a grid-like facade standing out in the bottom center-left. The sky is blue with scattered white clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main elements and the camera's ascending motion, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and initial framing. The term \"level-angle aerial perspective\" is slightly contradictory; the shot is more accurately described as a high-angle aerial shot that becomes an extreme high-angle shot. The description of the skyline \"stretching across the middle of the frame\" might be an overstatement if, for example, the body of water on the left occupies a significant portion of the middle ground, confining the skyline to the center and right. The caption's claim that the middle and background \"maintain their relative positions\" is an oversimplification of the parallax effect; as the camera ascends, the skyline and mountains would also shift downwards in the frame, albeit more slowly than the foreground, and the perceived distance between them would compress. Furthermore, the description of what is revealed—\"more of the urban landscape\"—is vague. A better caption would specify that the ascent reveals the street grid and intervening neighborhoods between the foreground and the downtown core. Finally, positioning the white apartment building in the \"bottom center-left\" is slightly awkward; \"in the lower-left quadrant\" or \"left of center in the foreground\" would offer greater clarity.",
