    "pre_caption": "This tracking shot begins as a full shot, capturing a woman in the foreground on the right side of the frame as she runs toward the left. As she moves, the camera pans to follow her, and the framing tightens into a medium-full shot, positioning her in the center-right of the frame from the shins up. In the middle ground, a fence and bushes stretch horizontally across the scene, blurred by the camera's movement. A white house and a large tree occupy the background, positioned behind the fence. The camera maintains a position at the woman's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black woman with blonde, curly hair styled in an updo is shown running. She is wearing a light-colored, sleeveless athletic tank top with a dark logo on the chest, paired with black running shorts. On her feet, she wears white and black running shoes with white socks. She is depicted from a front-side view, engaged in the act of running.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a daytime outdoor scene, the view moves leftward and slightly backward, creating a motion blur effect across a residential neighborhood. A person in a light-colored tank top and dark shorts runs from right to left. In the background, a white house with barred windows is visible, while in the midground, a silver fence and a line of green bushes separate the house from the foreground. A large, leafy tree with a thick trunk stands prominently against a bright, partly cloudy sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is good but could be more precise about the camera's movement and the spatial arrangement of background elements. The caption states the framing \"tightens\" but doesn't specify if this is due to a camera zoom or the camera physically moving closer to the subject (a dolly-in) while tracking her. In the video, the camera appears to dolly diagonally forward and left, moving both with and toward the woman, which is a more specific dynamic than just \"tightens.\" Additionally, describing the midground elements as a \"large tree and a fence\" is too general; the video shows the tree is a distinct vertical element on the far left of the midground, while the fence runs horizontally from the center to the right. The final framing of the woman as \"center-right\" is slightly inaccurate; she is consistently held in the right third of the frame to give her leading room as she runs left, a common compositional choice for moving subjects. Finally, the \"slight pan at the end\" seems to be a small, corrective adjustment as the woman's pace slightly varies, which is a detail that would clarify the nature of the camera's movement.",

In the background, a white house is visible behind the fence.
