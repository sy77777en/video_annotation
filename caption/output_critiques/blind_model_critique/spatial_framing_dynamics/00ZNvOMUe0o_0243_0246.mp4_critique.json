    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape with no single main subject. Initially, a dense green forest occupies the foreground and middle ground, filling the majority of the frame from the bottom upwards, with a large tree prominent in the right foreground. The ocean and a portion of the coastline are visible in the background, positioned across the top of the frame under a blue sky. The camera, positioned at a high aerial angle, slowly ascends. This movement causes the foreground trees to shift downwards, revealing more of the middle-ground forest and the full expanse of the curved coastline in the background. As the shot progresses, the ocean and sky take up slightly more space at the top of the frame, while the vast jungle stretches out below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures an expansive aerial landscape scenery shot, revealing a breathtaking panorama of a tropical coastline. The view sweeps over the vibrant green canopy of a dense, rolling jungle that stretches down to meet the deep blue ocean. In the distance, the shoreline curves into a wide bay under a bright blue sky lightly scattered with fluffy white clouds. There is no single main subject in this shot. The focus is intentionally broad, capturing the immense scale and natural beauty of the entire environment. The composition emphasizes the relationship between the forest, the land, and the sea, creating an atmospheric and immersive experience rather than directing attention to a specific object or entity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of a dense, green forest covering rolling hills. The camera slowly ascends, revealing a view of the blue ocean in the distance. A curved coastline with a beach separates the lush vegetation from the water. The scene takes place during the day under a clear blue sky with a few scattered white clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the core elements and the camera's upward movement, it could be more precise about the dynamic changes in framing and scale. The description of the initial shot as an \"extreme wide shot\" is slightly inaccurate; it would be better described as a wide shot that *transitions into* an extreme wide shot as the camera ascends, emphasizing the dramatic change in perspective. The camera movement itself might be more complex than a simple \"ascend,\" possibly involving a simultaneous pull-back motion that would more effectively create the sense of reveal. Furthermore, the phrase \"take up slightly more space\" significantly understates the visual transformation; as the camera rises, the ocean and coastline likely shift from being a narrow band at the top to occupying a substantial portion of the upper half of the frame, becoming a co-dominant feature with the forest. The caption also misses an opportunity to mention finer details that would emerge during the ascent, such as the white foam of waves breaking on the shore or the distinct texture of the sand, which become visible as the coastline is more fully revealed.",
