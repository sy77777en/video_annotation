    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of scenery, featuring dark tree branches in the left and right foreground. In the background, the rooftops of houses are positioned in the center of the frame, with a cloudy sky at the top. The camera then tilts downward to reveal a wide shot of a man standing in the center of a large lawn, which occupies the middle ground. In the final frame, a tall green hedge forms the background at the top of the frame. The camera is positioned high above the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a view over a tall green hedge, showing the rooftops of suburban houses against a cloudy sky. The camera then tilts downward to reveal a man standing alone in the center of a large, manicured lawn. He is wearing a white hood that conceals his head and face, a black suit jacket, black trousers, and a white collared shirt that is untucked on both sides. A black tie hangs loosely around his neck, askew to his right. He stands still, facing slightly to his left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins with a view over trees and a tall hedge, showing the tiled roofs of suburban houses under a partly cloudy sky. The camera then tilts downward to reveal a large, manicured green lawn enclosed by the hedge. In the center of the lawn, a man stands alone, dressed in a black suit, white shirt, and a loosened black tie, with a white hood concealing his head and face. The scene is shot during the daytime with even lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the camera's downward tilt and the basic composition of the initial and final frames, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and composition. In the opening shot, the background rooftops are likely positioned in the lower-center of the frame, below the horizon line, with the cloudy sky occupying the upper half, a detail not specified. The description of the transition could be more dynamic by explaining how the foreground tree branches slide upward and the background rooftops are obscured as the lawn enters the frame from the bottom during the tilt. For the final frame, the description of the man in the \"center\" could be clarified to specify if he is in the vertical and horizontal center of the frame, and his small scale within the wide, high-angle shot could be emphasized to better convey the spatial relationship with the vast lawn. Furthermore, the hedge in the background could be described more specifically, for instance, as forming a solid, straight line that occupies the top third of the frame, providing a stronger sense of the final composition's rigid geometry.",
