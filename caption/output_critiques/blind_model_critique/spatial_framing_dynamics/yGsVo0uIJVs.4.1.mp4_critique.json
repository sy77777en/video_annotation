    "pre_caption": "This static full shot centers on a massive ship under construction, which occupies the middle ground and background of the frame. In the lower-right foreground, the back of a partially visible person is shown. A group of three people stands in the left middle ground, while two smaller figures are positioned in the central middle ground near the ship's base. The scene is framed on the left by a large, textured wall. In the background, a bridge-like structure extends across the upper right portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, establishing a clear sense of depth with elements placed in the foreground, middle ground, and background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The central subject is a massive ship under construction within a dry dock. The ship's hull is painted red on the bottom half and black on the top half. Its bow is pointed and unfinished, and the entire structure is enveloped in extensive metal scaffolding. In the lower-right foreground, the back of a person is visible. This individual wears a yellow hard hat and an orange safety vest over a dark shirt. In the midground on the left, a group of three people stands together, all wearing yellow hard hats and orange safety vests over dark clothing. They are observing the ship. In the distance, near the base of the ship, two more smaller figures, also appearing to be workers, can be seen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A massive ship with a red and black hull is under construction within a vast, excavated basin with sheer, textured walls. The ship is surrounded by extensive metal scaffolding, and a tall, derrick-like structure is visible on its deck. The ground is a flat, earthen surface. In the foreground, a construction worker in a yellow hard hat and orange vest is seen from behind, looking towards the vessel. To the left, a small group of three other workers stands together, while a few more figures are scattered in the distance near the ship. A bridge-like structure extends over the basin in the background. The scene is enveloped in a hazy, bright light under a pale, uniform sky.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of a large ship along with several humanoid subjects. A humanoid in the lower-right foreground is partially visible, while three humanoids in the midground on the left are fully visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the key subjects and their placement across the foreground, middle ground, and background, it could be more precise and dynamic. The term \"full shot\" is ambiguous for a subject of this scale; \"wide shot\" would be more appropriate. The description of the ship as being \"centered\" conflicts with the subsequent mention of a left-to-right pan; the caption should describe the ship's changing position within the frame as the camera moves. The \"bridge-like structure\" is likely a gantry crane, and using this more specific term would add clarity. Furthermore, the caption describes the scene as a static composition before mentioning the camera movement at the end. It would be more effective to integrate the movement into the description from the beginning, explaining how the slow pan and upward tilt gradually reveal the scene's scope, reframe the subjects, and emphasize the immense scale of the ship in relation to the human figures. For example, the pan might begin on the group of three people and the wall, with the ship on the right, before moving to center the ship's hull and reveal the two smaller figures at its base, creating a more narrative flow of the visual information.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This wide shot captures a massive ship under construction, initially positioned on the right side of the frame. The scene begins with a slow pan and upward tilt, starting with a group of three people and a large, textured wall on the left. As the camera moves, the ship's hull becomes centered, revealing two smaller figures at its base, emphasizing the ship's immense scale in relation to the human figures. In the lower-right foreground, the back of a partially visible person is shown. A gantry crane extends across the upper right portion of the frame, adding to the industrial setting. The camera's movement creates a dynamic narrative flow, gradually unveiling the scene's depth with elements placed in the foreground, middle ground, and background.",
