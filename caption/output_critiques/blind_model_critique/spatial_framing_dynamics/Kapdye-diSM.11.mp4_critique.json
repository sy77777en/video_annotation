    "pre_caption": "This medium shot, filmed from a high angle, initially frames a red sports car in the foreground, occupying the bottom-left and center of the screen. A large stone building extends from the middle ground along the top and left side of the frame, while an asphalt street with parking lines fills the center and right, leading to a white sedan parked in the middle ground at the top right. A text overlay is fixed in the bottom-right corner. As the camera moves forward, the red car shifts toward the bottom-left corner, revealing more of its rear. Simultaneously, a man in the middle ground walks from right to left along the sidewalk at the top left before exiting the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A red, two-door sports car is positioned in the foreground, angled to show its rear three-quarters. The car has a sleek, curved body, a black roof panel, and silver, five-spoke, star-shaped wheels with a yellow center cap featuring a black horse emblem. A small \"Ferrari\" script logo is visible on the rear of the vehicle. In the midground, a white sedan is parked further down the right side of the street. On the sidewalk to the left, a man in a dark suit jacket is walking past a building window.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, moves along an outdoor city street during the day. The scene is set on an asphalt road with white painted lines designating perpendicular parking bays. To one side, a large, multi-story building constructed from light-colored stone features classical architecture with numerous windows. The camera moves parallel to the building's wall. A bright red sports car is stationary nearby. In the middle ground, a white sedan is parked further down the street. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"the STRADMAN\" in a stylized red and white font.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the key elements and the high-angle shot, but the description of the camera and subject movement could be more precise. Stating the camera \"moves forward\" while the car \"shifts toward the bottom-left\" is slightly counterintuitive; a more likely movement to achieve this effect would be a forward dolly combined with a slight pan or arc to the right. The caption also misses that as the camera moves closer, the red car would likely appear to grow in size before shifting its position in the frame. Furthermore, the description of the man's appearance is abrupt; it is unclear if he enters the frame from the left edge or emerges from behind an element like a pillar of the stone building. Finally, for a \"wide shot,\" the description of depth stops at the middle ground; mentioning any visible background elements, such as distant trees or other buildings behind the white sedan, would provide a more complete spatial context.",
