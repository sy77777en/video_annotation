    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a man in a fedora is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, gesturing with his arms, which extend across the central space. Initially, another man in a black t-shirt is visible in the center-left middle ground behind the main subject; he then moves horizontally to the left side of the frame and exits. On the right side, a man in a blue t-shirt remains in the middle ground. On the left side, a man in a white t-shirt and cap, also in the middle ground, transitions from a bent-over to an upright position. A row of computer monitors lines the background behind the subjects. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a light-skinned man with a short beard, wearing a tan fedora and a black t-shirt with a white logo that reads \"Dilla Donuts.\" He is centrally located, gesturing with his arms and has an open-mouthed expression. Three other men are positioned around him. Initially to the left rear of the main subject is a younger, light-skinned man with short brown hair in a black t-shirt, who also has his mouth open. He gradually moves toward the left side of the frame and eventually exits from the left. To the right, a man with short dark hair and glasses wears a blue t-shirt and is smiling. On the left, a man with a beard, glasses, and a purple and grey baseball cap is seen in a white t-shirt, initially bent over before straightening up.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a brightly lit indoor room with plain, light-colored walls and standard white lights on the ceiling. In the background, a row of computer monitors with black screens and white frames at the bottom sits on a long desk. Several men in casual attire are positioned throughout the space, moving energetically. The video is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom, and the overall color palette is desaturated.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively identifies the subjects and their general positions, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and interactions. For instance, the description of the main subject's gestures is vague; it could specify if his arms are pointing toward one of the other subjects or the background monitors, which would create a clearer link between the elements in the scene. The movement of the man in the black t-shirt could be detailed further by describing if he walks directly behind the main subject, creating a momentary overlap that emphasizes the depth between foreground and middle ground. Similarly, for the man in the white t-shirt, clarifying whether he rises from a seated position or simply straightens up from leaning over a desk would provide a more accurate depiction of his change in vertical space. Finally, the description of the \"row of computer monitors\" could be enhanced by noting if they are illuminated or displaying content, as this would add another layer to the background's spatial presence and the overall environment.",

Initially, another man in a black t-shirt is visible in the center-left middle ground behind the main subject; he then moves horizontally to the left side of the frame, momentarily overlapping with the main subject, before exiting. On the right side, a man in a blue t-shirt remains stationary in the middle ground. On the left side, a man in a white t-shirt and cap, also in the middle ground, transitions from leaning over a desk to an upright position.
