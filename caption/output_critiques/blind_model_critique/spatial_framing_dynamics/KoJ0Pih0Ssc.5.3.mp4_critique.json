    "pre_caption": "This scenery shot, which does not feature a main subject, begins with a low-angle close-up. Brown dirt fills the foreground in the bottom half of the frame, while a strip of yellow grass and a parallel concrete walkway occupy the middle ground in the upper half. In the background, a line of anti-tank obstacles is positioned in front of a grey wall. The camera then pulls back, pans right in a clockwise arc, and tilts up, smoothly transitioning into a wide shot. In this final composition, a tall, curving grey wall, identified by a blue text overlay in the lower-center as the \"OUTER WALL,\" dominates the right side of the frame, running from the middle ground into the background. The dirt path, grass, and the initial wall with obstacles are now on the left, with city buildings visible in the distant background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a historical recreation scenery shot of a fortified urban border, likely the Berlin Wall's \"death strip.\" The perspective pans across the desolate, multi-layered security zone, starting with a view over brown dirt and a wide, raked strip of grassland. This area is bordered by a concrete pathway and a grey wall, in front of which stands a uniform line of X-shaped, metal anti-tank obstacles. The view then shifts to follow a second, taller, and smoother grey concrete wall with a rounded top, which curves into the distance, set against a backdrop of nondescript city buildings under a clear sky. There is no main subject, as the focus is deliberately placed on the oppressive and complex environment, using the sweeping motion to convey the scale and impassibility of the entire fortified structure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor, high-security corridor under a clear, sunny sky, the camera arcs clockwise and tilts upward along a dirt path. Adjacent to the path is a strip of yellow, patchy grass situated between two parallel concrete walkways. To the left, a tall, grey concrete wall is lined with a row of metal anti-tank obstacles, with city buildings visible in the background. To the right, a solid, curving grey concrete wall runs alongside the path. As the camera progresses, a blue overlay text box with the white words \"OUTER WALL\" appears in the lower-middle part of the frame, indicating the wall on the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the core camera movement and the general shift from a detailed to a wide perspective, but it could be more precise in its spatial descriptions. The initial shot is described as a \"close-up,\" but given that it contains multiple distinct environmental layers (dirt, grass, walkway, obstacles, wall), a \"medium shot\" would be a more fitting classification. The description of the final composition could also be improved by clarifying the relationship between the key elements; for instance, specifying that the dirt path runs along the *exterior* of the \"OUTER WALL\" would provide a clearer mental image. Furthermore, the anti-tank obstacles and the strip of grass, which are key elements in the opening frame, are not mentioned in the description of the final wide shot. In the video, they remain visible as a continuous line at the base of the wall, and including this detail would create a more cohesive description of how the elements are reframed after the camera movement. Finally, describing the camera's motion as \"arcs clockwise, pans right, and tilts up\" is slightly redundant; a more concise and accurate description might be that the camera \"cranes upward and pans right\" to reveal the expansive view.",
