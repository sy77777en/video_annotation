    "pre_caption": "A high-angle wide shot, filmed from directly above, shows a small, red figurine lying in the center of the frame on a dark, paved surface. A white line is visible on the left side of the frame. The right half of the frame is consumed by a deep shadow, while the figurine and the area to its left are illuminated. The camera and all elements within the scene remain completely static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, red, male figurine lies face down on a dark, asphalt-like surface marked with a white line, with its face turned toward the right side of the frame. The entire figure is a uniform, bright red color. It is positioned at the center of the frame, with its hands behind its back, as if bound. The light source illuminates the center, left side, and lower-right corner of the frame, while the rest of the area remains in deep shadow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a bird's eye view of a dark, paved surface at night. The asphalt ground, marked with a single pale yellow line on the bottom left, is partially illuminated, casting a deep shadow that envelops most of the right side of the scene, except for the bottom right corner. In the lit area, a small, solid red, human-like figure lies on its stomach on the pavement.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Your description accurately captures the core elements and the camera movement, but it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and the dynamic transition. The initial framing feels more like a medium-long shot focused on the area around the figurine, rather than a true wide shot, which only becomes apparent after the zoom. The description of the yellow line as \"occupying the left side\" is slightly misleading; in the video, the line clearly traverses the frame diagonally from the top-left, passing just to the left of the central figurine before exiting towards the bottom-right. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the final state of the composition; as the camera zooms out to an extreme wide shot, the figurine becomes a small red speck, and the single yellow line is revealed to be one of several marking an empty parking space, with the shadow on the right originating from a car parked in the adjacent spot. Specifying that the initial shot transitions from a medium-long to an extreme wide shot and describing what this change reveals would better illustrate the full spatial dynamic of the scene.",
