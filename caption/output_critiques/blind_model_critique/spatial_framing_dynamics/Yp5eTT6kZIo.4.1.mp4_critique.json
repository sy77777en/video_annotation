    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a level angle, presents a seascape with a large naval vessel positioned in the left middle ground and a smaller ship visible in the center background on the horizon. The sea occupies the lower half of the frame, with a cloudy sky filling the top half. A second vessel, carrying numerous soldiers, enters the scene from the right foreground and moves forward, its front half eventually occupying the right side of the frame. The soldiers are fully visible standing on the deck of this foreground vessel. The camera remains at the subjects' level, moving in tandem with the foreground ship.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, grey military warship, likely a destroyer, is positioned in the midground on the left. It has a complex superstructure with masts, radar equipment, and gun turrets. In the foreground on the right, the rear and side of a metallic, reflective vessel are visible. A group of soldiers stands crowded together on its deck along the railing. These men are all wearing drab-colored military uniforms and helmets, and are seen in profile and from the front as they look out over the water. On the command platform, there are two helmeted soldiers and one person wearing a wide-brimmed military cap. Far in the distance, between the two larger vessels, the silhouette of a third ship is visible on the horizon, appearing smaller due to the distance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a vast, teal-green ocean under a dramatic sky filled with dark clouds and pierced by rays of sunlight. The low sun creates a bright, shimmering path of light across the choppy water's surface. In the middle ground, a large, gray naval warship with a complex superstructure is visible, while a second ship can be seen on the distant horizon. A personnel-filled vessel enters from the right foreground, its metallic hull and railing visible, with silhouettes of several soldiers in helmets standing. The boat's movement creates a bow wave that cuts through the water.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the sea from a level angle. At first, a ship is fully visible on the left side of the frame. Then another ship enters from the right, and eventually its front half is revealed, with many soldiers standing fully visible on it.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and their general positions, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and the nature of the movement. The phrase \"moves forward\" is ambiguous; a more descriptive path, such as \"moves diagonally from the right foreground toward the center,\" would better clarify the ship's trajectory. While the caption correctly states the shot is wide, it fails to describe the dynamic change in framing; as the foreground ship enters and moves, the effective shot on that subject tightens from a long shot to more of a medium-long shot, a key detail that is missed. The description of the soldiers as \"fully visible\" is also vague; specifying that they are visible as small, distinct figures on the deck would provide a better sense of scale. Finally, the sentence structure describing the background vessel being obscured is slightly clunky; integrating this action more fluidly into the description of the foreground ship's movement would improve coherence—for instance, \"As the foreground ship moves across the frame, its hull progressively obscures the vessel on the horizon.\"",
