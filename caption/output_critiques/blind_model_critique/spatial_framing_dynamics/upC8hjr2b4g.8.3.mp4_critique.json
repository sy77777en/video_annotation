    "pre_caption": "A medium shot statically frames two central figures. In the middle ground, a larger, standing figure is positioned slightly left of center, leaning forward over a smaller, seated figure located to the right of center. The larger figure's right hand rests on a dark brown surface in the bottom-left foreground. In the right background, a third, out-of-focus figure is visible. The camera remains stationary at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit setting, two low-polygon, white, sculptural figures are in the foreground. The larger of the two, a masculine-presenting figure, stands and leans forward, placing its left hand on the back of the head of the smaller figure. Its right hand rests on a surface beside it. The smaller figure, also rendered in the same faceted, white style, is seated in a chair with a perforated back. This figure has a cap-like shape on its head and is looking down with its head bowed. In the background, another similar but less distinct white, low-polygon figure stands in the shadows. All figures have a non-realistic, blocky, and geometric appearance, resembling digital sculptures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting with a dark background, two white, low-polygon figures are centrally positioned. A larger, standing figure leans forward, placing its left hand on the back of the head of a smaller, seated figure whose head is bowed. The seated figure is in a white chair with a perforated back, while the standing figure rests its other hand on a dark brown surface in the foreground. The lighting casts soft shadows across their faceted, geometric forms. In the deep background, a third, out-of-focus figure is faintly visible. Yellow subtitles appear sequentially at the bottom of the screen, reading: \"The students that've been there longer,\" \"who are more acquainted with the rules,\" \"put in some kind of discipline on other students.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subjects and their basic arrangement but lacks crucial details about the video's dynamics and spatial relationships. It describes the scene as static, failing to mention that the standing figure on the left actively gestures with their left hand toward the seated figure, while the seated figure turns their head upward to follow the gesture. The description of depth is also imprecise; the dark brown desk is in the foreground, but both central figures are clearly positioned in the middle ground, with the standing figure leaning over the desk, not positioned entirely in the foreground. Additionally, the caption omits the camera's perspective, which is at a high angle relative to the seated figure, looking down on the interaction. Most importantly, it misses a slow camera push-in that gradually tightens the frame from a medium shot to a medium close-up, increasing the focus on the interaction between the two central figures.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium shot initially frames two central figures, capturing a dynamic interaction. In the middle ground, a larger, standing figure is positioned slightly left of center, actively gesturing with their left hand toward a smaller, seated figure located to the right of center. The seated figure turns their head upward to follow the gesture. The larger figure's right hand rests on a dark brown desk in the bottom-left foreground, while they lean over it. In the right background, a third, out-of-focus figure is visible. The camera, positioned at a high angle relative to the seated figure, looks down on the interaction and gradually pushes in, transitioning from a medium shot to a medium close-up, enhancing the focus on the exchange between the two central figures.",
