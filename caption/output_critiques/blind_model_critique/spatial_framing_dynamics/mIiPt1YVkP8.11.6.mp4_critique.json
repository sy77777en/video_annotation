    "pre_caption": "A high-angle wide shot presents a static view of a miniature airport model. A small, white model airplane is located in the bottom left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a curved taxiway. A long runway extends diagonally across the middle ground from the top left to the bottom right. A complex system of taxiways occupies the foreground and middle ground, looping around the bottom and left sections of the frame and intersecting with the runway. The camera is positioned above the scene and remains stationary.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, white model of a passenger airplane is situated on a miniature airport layout. The airplane is a jet with two engines mounted under its wings and is positioned on a curved, dark gray-brown taxiway marked with a yellow centerline. This taxiway is part of a larger network that intersects with a long, straight runway that is light brown in color. The runway features white markings, including directional arrows, a centerline, and a prominent threshold marked with a series of parallel white stripes. The entire airport model is set against a uniform, dark brown surface representing the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A high-angle view captures a stylized, miniature model of an airport. A single, long runway with white markings, including a prominent threshold, cuts across the frame. A complex system of curved taxiways, delineated by yellow centerlines, weaves around and intersects with the runway. A small, white, unadorned model airplane sits on a taxiway loop near the runway intersection. The ground features varying shades of brown, adding depth to the scene and creating a more dynamic color scheme.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by identifying the shot size and key elements, but it lacks specificity regarding the video's dynamic aspects and overall composition. The description of the camera movement as \"zooms in at certain points\" is too general; it should detail the transition, specifying that the initial wide shot smoothly zooms into a medium shot, which reframes the white airplane in the center of the screen. A crucial potential omission is the movement of the airplane itself; if the video shows the model taxiing along the curved path, the caption is incomplete as it only describes a static initial position. Additionally, the description of the scene feels sparse by focusing only on the tarmac; mentioning the position of other significant elements, such as a large terminal building occupying the top right background or smaller service vehicles parked in the midground near the main aircraft, would create a more comprehensive and accurate spatial map of the model airport.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a high-angle wide shot of a miniature airport model, capturing a static view of the scene. A small, white model airplane is initially positioned in the bottom left of the frame on a curved taxiway. As the video progresses, the camera smoothly zooms into a medium shot, centering the airplane as it taxis along the curved path. The long runway extends diagonally across the middle ground from the top left to the bottom right, intersecting with a complex system of taxiways that loop around the bottom and left sections of the frame. In the top right background, a large terminal building is visible, while smaller service vehicles are parked in the midground near the main aircraft. The camera remains stationary except for the zoom transition, providing a dynamic view of the model airport's layout and activity.",
