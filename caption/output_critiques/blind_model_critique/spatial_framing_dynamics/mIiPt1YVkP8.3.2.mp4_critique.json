    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot from a camera positioned at the level of an approaching aircraft, showing an animated airport at night that occupies the bottom half of the frame. The approaching plane is in the top right background, while two stationary airplanes are visible on a taxiway in the bottom left middle ground. The camera slowly zooms in, transitioning to a wide shot, as the approaching aircraft moves from the top right toward the center, descending toward the occupied taxiway. Before reaching the ground, the aircraft pulls up and climbs away from the center of the frame. The zoom reveals two additional stationary aircraft on the taxiway in the bottom middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A computer-generated animation depicts a nighttime scene at an airport, focusing on a potential aviation incident. The main subject is a white passenger jet shown in the air on a landing approach. On the ground, four other white passenger jets are stationary on a taxiway. The situation's urgency is conveyed through a series of text overlays representing radio communications. A light blue text from \"UAL1\" questions the approaching plane's trajectory, stating, \"Where is this guy going?\" This is followed by a yellow text from \"SFO TWR\" issuing a command: \"Air Canada, go around.\" In response, the animation shows the airborne jet aborting its landing and climbing away, while a final red text from \"ACA759\" confirms, \"In the go around, Air Canada 759.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is an animated depiction of an airport at night, set against a dark, featureless sky. The airport layout consists of gray runways and taxiways, outlined with white markings and small, glowing lights. Circular patches of green grass are visible between the paved surfaces. On the ground, four white airplanes are positioned on a taxiway. A white passenger jet is seen descending toward the airport, aligned with the taxiway. Before reaching the ground, the aircraft aborts its landing, pulls up, and climbs away from the airport. Throughout the video, text overlays appear at the bottom of the screen, displaying call signs and dialogue. These include \"UAL1: Where is this guy going?\" and \"UAL1: He's on the taxiway.\" in blue and white, \"SFO TWR: Air Canada, go around.\" in yellow and white, and \"ACA759: In the go around, Air Canada 759\" in red and white.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main actions and shot transitions, but it could improve the description of spatial relationships and dynamic changes. For instance, stating the camera is \"at the level of an approaching aircraft\" is ambiguous; a more precise description, based on the visual of a plane in the \"top right background,\" would be that the camera is at a low angle on the ground, looking up. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the dynamic change in depth; as the aircraft moves from the top right, it should be noted that it also travels from the background toward the middle ground, increasing significantly in size. Furthermore, the connection between the aircraft's movement and the camera's pan is unclear. A more integrated description would state that as the aircraft pulls up and banks left, the camera pans left to follow it, which in turn reveals the two additional planes. Finally, the positions of the initial two stationary planes are not updated; as the camera moves forward, they would likely shift from the bottom left middle ground to become more prominent in the bottom left foreground before the pan redirects the view.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a low-angle extreme wide shot from a camera positioned on the ground, looking up at an animated airport at night. The airport occupies the bottom half of the frame, while an approaching aircraft is visible in the top right background. Two stationary airplanes are initially seen on a taxiway in the bottom left middle ground. As the camera slowly zooms in, transitioning to a wide shot, the approaching aircraft moves from the top right background toward the middle ground, increasing significantly in size as it descends toward the occupied taxiway. Just before reaching the ground, the aircraft pulls up and banks left, prompting the camera to pan left to follow its movement. This pan reveals two additional stationary aircraft on the taxiway in the bottom middle ground. As the camera moves forward, the initial two stationary planes shift to become more prominent in the bottom left foreground before the view redirects with the pan.",
