    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot frames a flock of birds as small silhouettes against a sunset sky in the background. The birds are scattered in several loose groups across the middle and upper portions of the frame, occupying the middle ground. A dark, indistinct cloud formation is positioned along the bottom of the frame, also in the middle ground. The flock moves horizontally from left to right across the scene. The camera is positioned below the subjects, looking up towards the sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A flock of birds, appearing as dark silhouettes, flies in several loose groups. The individual birds are seen with their wings outstretched as they move across the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene captures a flock of birds silhouetted against a grainy, gradient sky at sunset. The sky transitions from a muted, grey tone at the top to a soft orange hue. A dark, indistinct cloud formation is visible along the bottom of the scene. The birds are scattered across the sky, flying in the same general direction. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays white text that reads, \"Soft feathered wings, moving quietly across the sky.\"**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera zooms in significantly, making it difficult to determine the exact height relative to the subject, but it appears to be positioned below the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's assignment of depth feels counter-intuitive; describing the birds as \"foreground\" while the clouds are \"middle ground\" is confusing. Given the birds are \"small silhouettes,\" they are likely distant, placing them in the middle ground, while the \"dark, indistinct cloud formation\" at the bottom of the frame would be closer and thus in the foreground. The description of the flock's movement as purely \"horizontally from left to right\" is an oversimplification. In the video, the flock's movement is more fluid; the groups of birds subtly change altitude and density, creating an undulating effect rather than a rigid horizontal path. Furthermore, the caption states the birds are \"scattered in several loose groups,\" but it fails to mention that the largest group is concentrated on the left, gradually thinning as it moves right, with smaller satellite groups trailing at slightly different heights, a key detail of the scene's composition. A more accurate description would reverse the depth of the birds and clouds and detail the more complex, wave-like dynamics of the flock's movement and its evolving spatial distribution.",
