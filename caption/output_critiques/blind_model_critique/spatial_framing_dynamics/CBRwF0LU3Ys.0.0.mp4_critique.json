    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, a hot air balloon is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, set against a vast, snow-covered landscape that occupies the background. The camera, initially at the balloon's level, tracks alongside it while tilting downwards, transitioning to a position above the subject. Throughout this dynamic movement, the balloon remains centered in the frame as the expansive wintry terrain rushes by below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A hot air balloon with a red, white, and blue vertically striped envelope is shown in the air. The side of the balloon features the word \"PORSCHE\" in blue capital letters. Below this, the text \"-30°\" is displayed in white on a blue background, and \"+30°\" is displayed in white on a red background. Underneath the numbers, the blue hashtag \"#DRIVE2EXTREMES\" is visible. The balloon is attached to a light brown wicker basket.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an aerial view of a vast, snow-covered landscape during sunrise or sunset. A single hot air balloon with red, white, and blue vertical stripes drifts over the scene. The balloon is marked with the word \"PORSCHE\" in blue text above large numbers reading \"-30°\" in white on a blue background and \"+30°\" in white on a red background. Below, the wintry terrain consists of dense, dark forests interspersed with open snowfields, and a frozen river winds through the landscape. The low sun casts a golden light across the horizon as the camera moves dynamically, tilting while tracking the balloon's flight over the expansive wilderness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively describes the camera's dynamic movement and the balloon's consistent central framing, it could be more precise about the initial and final spatial compositions. The term \"wide shot\" is somewhat general; a \"medium-long shot\" might better capture the balloon's prominence at the start. The description of depth could be enhanced by mentioning a foreground element, such as textured, snow-covered ground at the bottom of the frame, which would provide a clearer reference point as the camera moves. Additionally, the caption misses an opportunity to describe the spatial relationship within the subject itself, such as mentioning the basket suspended directly below the balloon's envelope. Finally, the description of the movement's conclusion could be more specific; instead of just \"a position above the subject,\" stating that it culminates in a \"direct top-down view\" would more accurately depict the final framing and complete the visual arc of the shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a medium-long shot, a hot air balloon is prominently positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, set against a vast, snow-covered landscape that occupies the background.

Throughout this dynamic movement, the balloon remains centered in the frame, with the basket suspended directly below the envelope, as the expansive wintry terrain rushes by below. Textured, snow-covered ground in the foreground provides a clear reference point as the camera moves.",
