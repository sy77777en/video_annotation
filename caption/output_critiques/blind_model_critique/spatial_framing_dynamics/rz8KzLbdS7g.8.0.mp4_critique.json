    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot filmed from an eye-level, first-person perspective. The video begins with a large, rough-hewn stone pillar in the center-right foreground, partially obscuring a traditional Japanese house in the middle ground. A chain-link fence runs along the bottom of the frame, with a manicured pine tree visible behind it in the center-left. As the camera tracks steadily to the left, the stone pillar moves out of the frame to the right. This movement reveals more of the narrow paved road in the left foreground and middle ground, along with a wooden notice board that comes into view in the center, behind the fence. The house and pine tree, which were initially central, shift to the right side of the frame by the end of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a streetscape scenery shot capturing a quiet residential lane in a Japanese town. The camera tracks left along a narrow paved road, revealing traditional Japanese houses with dark tiled roofs and wooden facades. One prominent house features sliding glass doors and red curtains, fronted by a manicured pine tree and a small garden enclosed by a chain-link fence. The bright sunlight and clear blue sky with a few white clouds create a peaceful, sunny afternoon ambiance. The video lacks a central subject, as the camera's slow movement is designed to immerse the viewer in the tranquil atmosphere and architectural character of the neighborhood rather than focusing on a specific entity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, moves along a narrow street in a quiet Japanese residential neighborhood on a bright, sunny day. The view begins focused on a traditional house with a dark tiled roof and wooden-framed glass doors, partially obscured by a large, rough-hewn stone pillar. A rusty chain-link fence runs alongside the paved road, enclosing a yard with a manicured pine tree, and a yellow bamboo pole is used to protect the pipes inside. As the camera moves left, it reveals more of the quiet lane, lined with similar houses under a blue sky with white clouds and crisscrossing power lines. Inside the fence, there is a wooden notice board with a sheet of paper bearing large characters, covered with glass.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation for the video's spatial dynamics, but it could be more precise and comprehensive. While described as a \"wide scenery shot,\" the prominence of the foreground pillar suggests it might be more accurately termed a medium-wide shot. The description of the camera tracking \"steadily\" might be an oversimplification; if it's a first-person perspective, noting a slight, natural sway consistent with walking would add authenticity. The chain-link fence, placed in the \"bottom-left,\" likely extends along the entire bottom edge of the frame, acting as a constant foreground element. As the camera tracks left and the house shifts right, the caption fails to mention what is revealed in the newly opened-up space in the left and center middle ground—perhaps another part of the garden, a wall, or the side of another building. Furthermore, the description omits any mention of the sky, which would occupy the top portion of the frame, and fails to describe the movement of shadows, such as the pillar's shadow sweeping across the road, which would be a key dynamic element in a tracking shot.",
