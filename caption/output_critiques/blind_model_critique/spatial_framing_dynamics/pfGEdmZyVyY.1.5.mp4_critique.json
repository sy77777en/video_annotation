    "pre_caption": "In a static medium shot, a skeletal figure's upper body is visible in the middle ground, positioned slightly left of the frame's center. The foreground is almost entirely filled with a large, partially out-of-focus pile of sandwiches and plates, which obscures the lower half of the skeleton and the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, to the right of the skeleton, a small side table holds more stacks of sandwiches and a lit lamp. The background features dark curtains to the far left, a framed picture on the wall directly behind the space between the skeleton and the lamp, and a dark wooden cabinet on the far right. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level, creating a fixed composition with no spatial changes.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a dark, desiccated skeletal figure sitting upright on a sofa. The figure has a blackened, almost burnt texture, with sparse, thin white hairs visible on its skull and jaw area, and an open-mouthed expression revealing dark, empty eye sockets. It is dressed in a dirty, light-colored, sleeveless top or apron with a hole in the chest. The lower half of the figure is obscured by a massive pile of sandwiches and slices of bread that surround it. These sandwiches are stacked on numerous plates and a side table, and are also strewn across the floor, with many showing visible signs of green and black mold.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit room, where a skeletal figure in a tattered, blackened, and heavily stained tank top sits in a chair draped with a crocheted blanket. The room is overwhelmed with stacks of sandwiches, many showing signs of mold, piled on plates, the floor, and a small wooden side table. A single vintage lamp with a fringed shade illuminates the scene, casting a warm glow and deep shadows. In the background, dark patterned curtains hang beside a framed picture on the wall and a dark wood cabinet.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video depicts a skeleton sitting on a sofa in a domestic indoor living room, surrounded by a large pile of bread slices. Only the upper body of the skeleton is visible, while the rest is obscured by the bread.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main elements and camera movement, but it could be more precise about the resulting changes in framing and depth. The description of a \"medium shot\" is only accurate for the beginning; as the camera pulls back, the shot transitions into a medium-long shot, and this change should be explicitly noted. The camera's height is also omitted; it appears to be positioned at a slight high angle, looking down on the scene, which allows the viewer to see over the foreground sandwiches. While the \"blurred gray subject\" is mentioned, its form could be described more concretely, for example, as \"the blurred, rounded back of an upholstered chair,\" which would better define the viewing space. Additionally, the caption should specify that the plane of focus is on the skeleton in the middle ground, creating a clear distinction from the out-of-focus foreground and the softer background. Finally, the description misses the spatial effect of the lit lamp, which casts a warm light on the right side of the skeleton and the adjacent table, creating shadows that enhance the sense of three-dimensional space and separate the middle ground from the dark background.",
