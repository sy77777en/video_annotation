    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a man in a spacesuit is positioned in the left foreground. A massive, dark spacecraft occupies the upper portion of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the background. In the right background, industrial metal structures are visible. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and angled upward, capturing the man as he looks up toward the spacecraft.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short, dark hair stands in a snowy environment, looking up and to the top left corner of the frame. He is wearing a white, bulky spacesuit with various patches and straps across the chest and legs, along with thick white gloves. In his hands, he holds a clear, spherical helmet.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds in a snowy, industrial environment under an overcast sky. A massive, dark metallic structure with large, circular thrusters on its underside looms overhead. Snow falls and blows through the air, creating a hazy, low-visibility atmosphere dominated by a muted palette of white and gray. In the background, metal trusses and platforms are visible. A figure in a white spacesuit stands on the ground holding a helmet.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and their general placement, but it lacks the dynamic detail expected for a video and could be clearer about spatial relationships. The description of the scene is static, failing to mention any movement, such as the man slowly turning his head to look up at the ship, steam venting from the spacecraft's hull, or blinking lights on the background structures, which would confirm this is a video. The phrasing for the spacecraft's position, \"extends from the upper right of the midground to the lower left of the background,\" is confusing; it would be more effective to state that the ship is angled diagonally across the frame, receding from the midground into the background. Furthermore, the caption misses a key foreground element by not specifying what the man is standing on, such as a metal gantry or platform, which is crucial for understanding his position. Finally, while the upward angle is noted, the description doesn't connect it to the man's action; stating that he gazes *up* towards the spacecraft would create a stronger sense of scale and spatial interaction between the subject and the massive object.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a medium full shot, a man in a spacesuit stands on a metal gantry in the left foreground. He slowly turns his head to gaze up at a massive, dark spacecraft, which is angled diagonally across the frame, receding from the midground into the background. Steam vents from the spacecraft's hull, adding a sense of movement. In the right background, industrial metal structures with blinking lights are visible, enhancing the dynamic atmosphere. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and angled upward, emphasizing the man's interaction with the towering spacecraft above him.",
