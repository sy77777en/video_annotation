    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot underwater, showing a man in a blue wetsuit in the center-middle ground holding a large spiny lobster that dominates the foreground. A second person with a camera is positioned in the top-left background. The man holding the lobster moves closer to the camera, shifting the shot to a medium close-up as he swims upward and breaks the surface. In the final shot, the man is in the center of the frame at the water's surface, with the lobster held in the right foreground, while the second person is visible in the left background. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with facial stubble is shown both underwater and at the surface of the ocean, wearing a blue and black wetsuit with a white \"YOUNGBLOODS\" logo on the chest and a scale-like pattern. He has on a black diving mask, a snorkel, and a head-mounted camera. Throughout the video, he holds a large, orange and white spiny lobster, displaying its segmented underside, long legs, and prominent spiny antennae. In the midground, a second person in a dark wetsuit and diving gear is visible, holding a large underwater camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds in a clear, turquoise ocean under a bright, blue sky. The perspective shifts from an underwater view, where sunlight filters through the water to a sandy seabed with rocky formations, to the choppy surface of the sea. A person wearing a blue and black patterned wetsuit with the white text \"YOUNGBLOODS\" on the chest is seen holding a large, orange spiny lobster. They are equipped with a black snorkel mask and have a camera mounted on their head. In the midground, another person in diving gear is also visible in the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the core action and the transition in shot size, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and environmental context. The description of the second person becoming visible \"as the camera moves\" is ambiguous; it would be more informative to specify that the camera pans left to reveal them in the midground, or that they swim into the frame from off-screen. The transition of breaking the surface is a significant spatial event that is undersold; a better description would note the camera lens emerging from the water, changing the background from a blue underwater scene, perhaps with a visible reef in the background, to an above-water view with the sky visible. The change in the lobster's position from \"dominating the foreground\" to the \"right foreground\" is mentioned, but the caption should clarify if this is because the man repositions the lobster as he swims upward, which is a key subject action. Lastly, stating the second person is \"initially invisible\" is speculative; it is more accurate to say they are initially out of frame and then enter the top-left midground.",
