    "pre_caption": "In a static, high-angle close-up, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene. She is propped up in bed, with pillows occupying the background space directly behind and around her. Throughout the shot, she remains centrally located as she slowly tilts her head upward, bringing her face closer to the camera positioned above her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young adult woman with light skin and curly brown hair pulled up on her head is shown from a high angle. She is sitting up in bed, wearing a light pink satin robe over a white top. Her face is illuminated from below in an otherwise dark room, and she is looking upward, gradually raising her head with wide, focused eyes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective looking down, the scene is set in a dark room at night. A woman is propped up in bed against white pillows and a grey bed frame. The only illumination comes from a light source positioned below her, casting a glow on her face and a light pink, satin-like robe, while the surrounding area remains in deep shadow, highlighting the contrast.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the woman in the \"middle ground\" is questionable for a close-up shot; as the primary subject, she would be considered in the foreground. Consequently, the pillows are more accurately placed in the middle ground, with the wall or headboard behind them constituting the background. The shot size might be better described as a medium close-up, as \"propped up in bed\" implies her shoulders and upper chest are visible, not just her face. The description could be improved by including potential foreground elements, such as the edge of a duvet at the bottom of the frame, which would add another layer of depth. Furthermore, stating she \"remains centrally located\" is an oversimplification; a more precise description would note the subtle vertical shift of her features within the central portion of the frame as her head tilts upward. Mentioning that the pillows in the middle ground are in soft focus would also add a critical detail about the scene's spatial depth.",
