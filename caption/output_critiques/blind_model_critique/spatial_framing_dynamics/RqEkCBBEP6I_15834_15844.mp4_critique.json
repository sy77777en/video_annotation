    "pre_caption": "This is a third-person game perspective, maintaining a medium shot of the character from behind while providing a wide shot of the scene. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. Initially, the character is in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, facing a lectern also in the middle ground, with walls of drawers in the left and right foreground and a collapsed rock wall in the background. The character walks past the lectern, then turns 180 degrees, causing the camera to pivot with him. Now, the character is in the middle ground, facing the background which is a continuation of the tunnel, while the lectern is in the foreground. He walks forward, moving from the middle ground deeper into the background, passing through a green-lit doorway on the left side of the frame. He continues along the tracks, moving around a central pillar in the middle ground, which shifts his position from the center to the left side of the frame before he recenters. The camera follows his movements consistently from an over-the-shoulder position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This third-person perspective video follows a man with shoulder-length dark hair as he explores a dark, collapsed tunnel. The man, seen from behind, wears a dark coat and has a satchel slung over his shoulder. He walks along train tracks, using a flashlight to illuminate his path. At the start, he is in a red-lit area and walks past a wooden lectern draped with a pink cloth, which has an open book resting on it. He makes a 180-degree turn before proceeding forward. As he moves forward, the lighting shifts to a turquoise tone when he reaches green doors with white graffiti. After passing through these doors, he is seen holding a pistol and walking through a tunnel that has graffiti on the walls and standing water in some areas.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot, framing the character from the hip up, follows them through a dark, collapsed tunnel with train tracks. Initially, a lectern with an open book stands in the middle of the tracks. The environment is illuminated by the character's flashlight and ambient red lighting, revealing rough rock walls, some of which are lined with rows of small, labeled drawers. After passing through a green door with white graffiti, the tunnel is illuminated by a blend of yellow, light blue, and red lights. The character continues along the track through a waterlogged area while holding a pistol. The walls and doors are covered in graffiti. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"COLLAPSED TUNNEL,\" \"MURDER CULT,\" and \"PLOT BOARD\" with an icon. In the bottom right corner, a HUD shows a gun icon with the numbers \"4|25\" and a progress bar for a certain game item, marked with the number \"1\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a third-person game perspective. The camera follows the character's movement, showing a medium shot of them, while showing a wide shot of the scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the general sequence of events, it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and dynamic transitions. The description of the \"walls of drawers extending from the foreground to the midground\" is slightly ambiguous; it would be clearer to state that the drawers line the walls starting from the midground and receding, as the immediate foreground is occupied by the character. The 180-degree turn is described as a single action, but the caption misses the dynamic visual shift during the camera's pivot, where the collapsed rock wall in the background briefly fills the frame before the tunnel entrance is revealed. Furthermore, the description of the camera pan could be improved by clarifying that the pan *reveals* the support columns, rather than implying the pan causes them to appear, and by specifying if the character is walking or stationary while looking around. The caption also omits key environmental details, such as the ambient lighting of the initial room and the specific placement of the collapsed rock wall, which appears to be a large pile of rubble in the center background, not a full wall. Lastly, stating the shot remains a consistent \"medium shot\" might be an oversimplification; as the character advances into the tunnel, the camera appears to pull back slightly, transitioning into a medium-long shot to give a broader view of the path ahead.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a third-person game perspective, maintaining a medium shot of the character from behind while providing a wide view of the scene. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. Initially, the character is centered in the frame and in the middle ground, facing a lectern also in the middle ground. The walls of drawers line the walls starting from the midground and recede, while a large pile of rubble, not a full wall, occupies the center background. The ambient lighting of the initial room is subtly illuminated. As the character walks past the lectern, he turns 180 degrees, and the camera pivots with him, briefly filling the frame with the collapsed rock wall before revealing the tunnel entrance. Now, the character is in the middle ground, facing the tunnel, with the lectern in the foreground. He walks forward, moving from the middle ground deeper into the background, passing through a green-lit doorway on the left side of the frame. As he continues along the tracks, the camera pans to reveal support columns, and he moves around a central pillar in the middle ground, shifting his position from the center to the left side of the frame before recentering. The camera consistently follows his movements from an over-the-shoulder position, transitioning into a medium-long shot as the character advances into the tunnel, providing a broader view of the path ahead.",
