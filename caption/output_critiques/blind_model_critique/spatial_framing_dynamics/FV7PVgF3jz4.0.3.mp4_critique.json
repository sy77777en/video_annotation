    "pre_caption": "The shot begins with a static, layered composition, where the red-lit keys of a keyboard occupy the bottom foreground. In the middle ground, vintage editing equipment is positioned centrally, with a pile of tangled black tape situated directly behind it, while additional reels are visible on the wall in the background. A man enters the frame from the right and moves into the central middle ground, where a medium shot captures his upper body as he sits down behind the equipment. He interacts with the tape reels before picking up a large, silver film canister. He then rises and moves towards the left, exiting the frame and leaving the equipment in the center of the shot. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's height throughout his presence in the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark, curly hair and a light skin tone appears in the frame. He is wearing a white tank top with black suspenders and has tattoos on both arms. He sits down behind a table with vintage-looking film or tape editing equipment, which is surrounded by tangled black movie film. He interacts with the film before picking up a large, circular, silver-colored metal film canister. He then holds the canister and moves out of the frame. In the foreground, the red-lit keys of a keyboard are visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit room bathed in an ambient red glow, a workspace is arranged with vintage-style equipment. The out-of-focus keys of a keyboard, illuminated in red, occupy the immediate foreground, though a dark block briefly obscures the view at the beginning and end of the video. On a surface beyond, a person interacts with two white film editing machines, each featuring a spinning reel. A tangled mass of shiny black movie film, catching an orange light, is piled behind the devices. The person handles the film, holding a large, round, silver film canister in their hand before exiting the frame. The background wall is adorned with additional reels and a pulley-like system under the red light source.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video takes place in an indoor studio environment. Initially, there is no subject in the frame. Then, a person appears and sits down, and his upper body is shown. He then picks up a disc-shaped object and walks out of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The subject only appears in the middle of the video, and the camera height is at the subject during that part.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively establishes the initial layered composition and the subject's main actions, but it could be more precise about the dynamic spatial relationships created by the camera movement. The description of the \"black obstruction\" is vague; specifying if it's a chair or another piece of equipment would add clarity. The caption states a medium shot is used when the man sits, but it omits the initial shot size, which is likely a wider shot to establish the scene before he enters. The most significant point of confusion is the camera movement. The caption states the camera \"trucks to the right throughout his presence\" but concludes that the equipment is left \"in the center of the shot.\" These two statements are contradictory; if the camera trucks right to follow the man's movement, the centrally-located equipment would shift to the left of the frame by the end of the shot. A more accurate description would detail how the camera's truck movement reframes the scene, perhaps keeping the man in the right half of the frame as he moves, and specify the equipment's final position in the left of the frame. Additionally, the caption does not mention the camera's height, which appears to be at a straight-on, eye-level angle relative to the seated man.",
