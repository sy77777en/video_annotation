    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground, with the camera at his level. In the background, a green field is visible, blurred with horizontal motion. The man lowers his head, directing his gaze toward the bottom right of the frame while remaining centrally framed. The camera maintains this consistent close-up on him as the background continues to blur, suggesting a tracking movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man, who appears to be in his 30s or 40s, is shown from the chest up. He has short, dark brown hair and a short, dark beard and mustache. He is wearing a blue and white zip-up jacket over a white t-shirt. On his head, he wears a pair of large, light gray over-ear headphones with a 'b' logo visible on the side. He is lowering his head and looking toward the lower right corner of the frame with a focused expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit setting with a green, turf-like floor, a man wearing light gray over-ear headphones bends forward and lowers his head in place. He is dressed in a blue and white color-blocked zip-up jacket. The background is dark and blurred with motion, suggesting an indoor sports facility or a field at night under artificial lighting. The camera captures the man in a close-up view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject, his action, and the general camera setup, but it could be more precise and less redundant. The description of the background as extending \"from the middle ground to the background\" is confusing for a scene with motion blur, as the depth planes would likely be compressed into a single, streaking background element; it would be clearer to describe it simply as a deep background in horizontal motion. The phrase \"occupying the central focus\" is redundant when the subject is already described as \"positioned in the foreground\" and \"centrally framed.\" Furthermore, the statement that the blur is \"suggesting a dynamic movement\" is speculative; the caption should state the visual fact that the background is in motion relative to the subject. A more specific shot size, such as \"medium close-up\" (if his shoulders are visible), would be more informative than the general \"close-up.\" Finally, the description could be enhanced by noting a key visual detail, such as how the passing light from the moving scenery might be intermittently illuminating the man's face, which would add to the dynamic quality of the shot without being subjective.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is centrally framed, with the camera at his eye level. The background is a green field in horizontal motion, creating a streaking effect. The man lowers his head, gazing toward the bottom right of the frame. The camera maintains a consistent focus on him as the background moves relative to his position. Intermittent light from the passing scenery occasionally illuminates his face, enhancing the dynamic quality of the shot.",
