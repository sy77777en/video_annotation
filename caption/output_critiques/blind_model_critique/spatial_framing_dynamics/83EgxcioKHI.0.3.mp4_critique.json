    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a person in a red coat सब्जेक्ट is positioned in the center-right foreground, running away from the camera. Two other individuals are slightly ahead in the middle ground, one to the left and one to the right of the main subject. A wrecked car is situated in the center-left middle ground, between the figures, while a large industrial building occupies the center and left middle ground. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, follows from behind, maintaining a relatively stable distance as the group moves away from the foreground and deeper into the scene along a muddy path.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a person seen from behind, running away from the camera. They are wearing a bright red, long-sleeved coat over a dark, long dress. They are running with two other individuals in a desolate, muddy area. To the left and slightly ahead of the main subject, a person in a long, dark coat walks or runs forward. To the right of the main subject, another person in a dark overcoat is pushing a wheelchair with someone seated in it. Initially, this individual is positioned closer to the front-left of the main subject, but as they move, the person transitions to the front-right of the main subject. Between the figures, in the midground, is a dark, wrecked car with a smashed front end and a caved-in hood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a desolate, industrial area under a foggy, overcast sky. A muddy, debris-strewn path extends from the lower-middle foreground to the middle-right background of the frame, where three figures are seen running away from the camera toward a large, multi-story industrial building on the left side of the path. To the left of this building, an arched gateway is part of a smaller structure with a sign that reads \"BEXHILL WATER AUTHORITY.\" The environment is littered with debris, and two wrecked, burnt-out cars are abandoned along the path. The entire scene is rendered in a desaturated, greenish-blue color palette, with the exception of a red jacket worn by one of the figures.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview, but it contains a potential contradiction and could be more precise about the subjects' movements and the camera's relationship to them. The statement that the camera maintains a \"relatively stable distance\" conflicts with the group moving \"deeper into the scene,\" which would cause them to shrink in the frame. The description should clarify if the camera is tracking at the same speed, keeping the subjects' size consistent, or if it's moving slower, causing them to recede from a full shot into a long shot. The term \"running\" for the main subject seems too fast for a group with a wheelchair; \"moving quickly\" or \"hurrying\" might better describe the collective pace. The description of the third individual is vague; specifying their action (e.g., scouting ahead, carrying supplies) would improve clarity. Additionally, the movement of the wheelchair pusher from the main subject's front-left to front-right could be more descriptive—was it a gradual drift or a distinct maneuver to change their formation? Lastly, the muddy path is a significant element of the foreground and middle ground that could be introduced earlier, as it grounds the entire scene and dictates the subjects' movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a full shot, a person in a red coat is positioned in the center-right foreground, hurrying away from the camera. Two other individuals are slightly ahead in the middle ground, one to the left and one to the right of the main subject. The individual on the left appears to be scouting ahead, while the one on the right is pushing a wheelchair, gradually drifting from the main subject's front-left to front-right. A wrecked car is situated in the center-left middle ground, between the figures, while a large industrial building occupies the center and left middle ground. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, tracks at the same speed, keeping their size consistent in the frame as the group moves along a muddy path, which is a significant element of the scene, grounding the subjects' movement as they progress deeper into the scene.",
