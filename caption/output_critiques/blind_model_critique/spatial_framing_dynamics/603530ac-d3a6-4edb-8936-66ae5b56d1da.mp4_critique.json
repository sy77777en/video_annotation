    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a woman in a dive, occupying the upper frame in the middle ground against a background sky, with a shoreline in the bottom left background. The camera is positioned low, looking up at her. As she descends, the shot tightens to a medium shot at water level, capturing her body entering the water in the foreground while the shoreline sits in the middle ground. The perspective then shifts to an underwater shot from a position below the point of entry, where the woman becomes a dark shape moving from the top center downwards into the middle ground. A large cloud of bubbles and turbulent water fills the foreground and moves upwards, obscuring her against the dark background water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with her hair tied back is shown mid-dive, her body arched and arms extended forward. She is wearing a dark, patterned one-piece swimsuit. As she enters the water headfirst, creating a large splash, her form becomes a dark, indistinct shape seen from an underwater perspective amidst a turbulent cloud of white and turquoise bubbles. The backlighting makes her hair color appear indistinct.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a bright, sunny day, a person dives into a large body of water, viewed from a low angle against the sky. Midway through the video, the perspective reveals a sunlit, rocky shoreline in the distance from the water's surface, before transitioning to an underwater shot. The moment of entry is captured below the surface, where the deep teal water is filled with the turbulence of the dive, showing churning white foam and a multitude of rising air bubbles.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a full shot of a woman preparing to dive into the water. As she approaches the water, it shifts to a medium shot, and finally, she almost disappears from the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject and then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a strong, sequential breakdown of the action, but it could be more precise about the transitions and visual details. The description of the first segment transitioning to the second is ambiguous; \"As she descends... The shot then tightens\" suggests a continuous camera movement, but a hard cut to a new camera position at water level seems more plausible and should be stated explicitly as \"The video then cuts to...\". In the initial shot, \"some ship equipment\" is too vague; specifying it as \"a ship's metal railing\" or \"the edge of the deck\" would ground the scene more effectively. The description of the woman's movement could also be improved; instead of just her hands moving to the \"lower right,\" it would be clearer to state that her entire body arcs from the upper frame toward the center-right as she descends. Finally, the underwater scene's description of a \"dark shape\" against \"dark teal background water\" is slightly confusing. It's more likely she is silhouetted against the brighter water surface above, with the bubbles from her entry momentarily obscuring this silhouette as they rise into the foreground before she continues her descent out of the frame.",
