    "pre_caption": "In this wide shot, a portion of a large airplane's wing and two engines are framed in the bottom left foreground. In the distance, a smaller fighter jet is positioned in the top right of the frame, flying in the middle ground against a background of clear sky. The lower half of the frame is filled with a hazy expanse of mountains in the background, establishing significant depth between the two aircraft and the landscape below. The camera is positioned at the height of the large plane's wing, looking out towards the horizon, with the fighter jet flying at a higher altitude. The spatial composition remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A portion of a large airplane's wing and two of its large, cylindrical jet engines are visible in the foreground. The wing and engines are teal with orange accents, and the engines feature large, dark, circular intakes. In the distance, a smaller, gray military fighter jet flies in the upper right of the scene. The fighter jet has a sleek design with swept-back wings and a single vertical tail fin.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From the perspective near a large aircraft, the scene captures a view over a teal-and-orange-colored wing and two large, cylindrical engine nacelles. In the distance, a smaller, gray fighter jet flies against a clear sky that transitions from blue at the top to a soft, pale glow along the horizon. Below, a hazy expanse of rolling hills and mountains stretches out, partially obscured by the atmospheric haze. The overall lighting indicates it is daytime.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and their general placement, but it fails to capture the dynamic nature of the scene. The fighter jet is not statically \"positioned\"; in the video, it actively maneuvers, initially holding formation in the upper right before banking slightly and moving closer toward the center of the frame, its engines glowing. This movement is a key element that the caption omits. Additionally, the description of the background is too simple. The video clearly shows a layer of scattered, thin clouds drifting between the two aircraft and the hazy mountains below, which not only adds another layer of depth but also reinforces the sense of high-speed forward motion for both planes. Finally, the description of the foreground could be more precise; the engine closest to the camera is fully framed in the bottom left corner, while the second engine is further down the wing and partially obscured, a detail that would better define the foreground composition.",
