    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot that explores an underwater habitat. The scene opens with a close-up, low-angle shot of a large, algae-covered rock in the center and top of the frame, positioned in the middle ground above a sandy seabed in the foreground. The camera then pulls back and pans right, transitioning to a wide shot that reveals a broader environment. In this wider view, large rocks occupy the left and center-background, with a dense bed of seagrass in the middle ground and schools of small fish swimming throughout. The camera continues to pull back and tilts upward, eventually breaking the water's surface to create a split-level view. The final frame shows the underwater rocks and seagrass in the bottom half and the tops of the rocks above the rippling water in the top half, with the camera positioned at water level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an underwater scenery shot that explores a shallow marine ecosystem. The scene is characterized by large, algae-covered rocks resting on a sandy seabed, surrounded by dense beds of green seagrass. Numerous small, silvery fish, including some darker-colored fish and striped sergeant major fish, swim in schools around the rocks and through the seagrass. The camera's movement, which transitions from a close-up and eventually breaks the water's surface to show the rocky shoreline, emphasizes the environment as a whole. There is no main subject because the focus is on the atmosphere and the interconnectedness of the habitat, showcasing the relationship between the rocks, plants, and fish rather than highlighting a single object or creature.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This underwater scene is set in a shallow, sunlit body of water with a light-colored sandy bottom. Large, irregular rocks covered in textured, purplish-brown and green algae are prominent. Patches of green seagrass grow from the sand around the base of the rocks. Schools of small, silvery fish swim actively through the seagrass and around the rocky structures, including some striped sergeant major fish and some fish in darker colors. The perspective shifts, transitioning from a close-up around the bottom of a rock to reveal the wider environment, and then briefly breaks the water's surface, showing a split view of the rocks above and below the rippling water.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the initial camera movement and the final split-level view could be more precise. While the caption correctly identifies a high-angle start, it's slightly confusing to say the camera \"moves to the right while ascending and slightly tilting upward\" all at once. In the video I'm imagining, the camera first tilts up from its high-angle position to a more level perspective before it begins its main ascent and sideways drift, a nuance that would clarify the transition. More importantly, the description of the final split-level shot seems inaccurate; it describes the bottom half as \"rippling water with reflections,\" which suggests the camera is fully above the water looking down. A true split-level shot would show the underwater world in the bottom half—the seagrass, fish, and submerged parts of the rocks—while the top half shows the scene above the surface. A better description would be: \"...eventually breaking the water's surface to create a split-level view, where the frame is horizontally divided by the waterline, showing the submerged seagrass and rocks in the bottom half and the rock tops against the sky in the top half.\" Additionally, specifying the direction of the fish, such as \"schools of small fish swim from the right background toward the center,\" would add more dynamic spatial detail.",
