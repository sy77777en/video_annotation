    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot captured at the subjects' level, a translucent human figure is positioned in the center-right of the frame, while a translucent toilet is situated in the center-left. Both subjects are located in the middle ground, standing on a dark, reflective surface that occupies the bottom of the frame. The entire scene is set against a solid black background, and there are no changes in framing or subject position throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An opaque, frosted-textured androgynous human figure stands bent over a translucent, frosted-textured toilet. The figure leans forward with one hand near its mouth and the other resting on its knee, in a posture suggesting nausea. The toilet has a blue light glowing from within its bowl and at its base. Both subjects are positioned on a dark, reflective surface against a black background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, featureless space, an opaque, frosted-textured humanoid figure stands bent over a translucent toilet. The figure, appearing androgynous, has one hand on its knee and the other near its mouth, leaning towards the toilet bowl. The scene is illuminated against a black background, with a soft blue light glowing from the base of the toilet.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the subjects' positions is contradictory and lacks precision. Stating that the human figure is \"in the center\" while the toilet is also \"in the center, to the left of the human figure\" is spatially impossible. In the video, the two subjects are balanced on either side of the vertical midline, with the human figure positioned in the right-center of the frame and the toilet in the left-center. The caption also misses the subtle depth relationship between them; the toilet is positioned slightly closer to the camera than the human figure, with its base partially overlapping the figure's feet, a detail that is essential for understanding their arrangement. Additionally, while the \"dark, reflective surface\" is mentioned, the caption fails to describe the faint, distorted reflections of the figure and toilet visible on the floor, which help to ground the subjects within the scene. Finally, the description of the toilet as \"translucent\" could be improved by specifying that the solid black background is visible through it, which better defines its volume and spatial presence relative to the opaque figure beside it.",
