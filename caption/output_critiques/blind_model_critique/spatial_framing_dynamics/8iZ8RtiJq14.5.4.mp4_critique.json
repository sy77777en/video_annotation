    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a faceless figure stands in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. To the left, a vintage television is positioned in the foreground, while a sofa is located in the middle ground on the right, partially behind the figure. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. The figure remains stationary throughout the shot, holding a phone to its ear with one hand and gesturing with the other in front of its chest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a single human figure with a smooth, featureless face and head, dressed in a light-colored shirt, a light pink tie, blue trousers, and a dark belt. The figure has a slender build and is depicted standing upright, using one hand to hold a phone to its ear while the other hand gestures. The figure’s body language suggests engagement in a conversation or preparation, and the absence of facial features or hair makes the subject appear stylized and ambiguous in age, gender, and ethnicity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a brownish vintage television set with a green glow emanating from the top is positioned in the lower left corner. In the lower right corner, a light-colored sofa with four light pink cushions is partially visible against a dark background. The scene is illuminated by a cool, bluish-white light that highlights a central, faceless figure wearing a light-colored shirt, a light-colored tie, and pants. The figure stands between the television and the sofa, holding a phone to his ear with one hand and gesturing with the other hand in front of his chest.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main elements and their general positions, it lacks the specificity needed to capture the scene's distinct visual character. The term \"faceless figure\" is too generic; a more accurate description would specify that the figure's head is an old television displaying static, directly mirroring the larger TV set in the foreground. The description of the gesture as simply \"gesturing\" is also vague; the video shows the figure slowly and repeatedly clenching and unclenching its hand, a detail that contributes to the scene's surreal and deliberate pacing. Furthermore, the caption omits that the vintage television in the bottom-left foreground is on, its screen also filled with static, creating a visual echo with the figure's head. The spatial description could be more precise by noting that the sofa on the right is a dark leather material, and by including the dimly lit, textured wall that constitutes the background, which is essential for defining the scene's limited depth.",
