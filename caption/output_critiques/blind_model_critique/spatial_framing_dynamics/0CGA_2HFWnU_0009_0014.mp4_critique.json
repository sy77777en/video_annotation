    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a cityscape with no main subjects. Initially, the foreground is dominated by green treetops across the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a prominent white high-rise building is positioned slightly left of center, with other residential buildings visible among the trees. The background features a downtown skyline stretching across the center of the frame, with a mountain range filling the upper third. The camera, positioned at a high angle, slowly ascends. As it rises, more of the low-rise buildings and rooftops in the middle ground are revealed in the lower half of the frame, while the background skyline and mountains shift relatively lower, creating an even higher-angle, more expansive view of the entire scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is an ascending aerial cityscape scenery shot that reveals a sprawling urban center against a mountainous backdrop. The view begins over a lush canopy of green treetops, gradually rising to show a mix of low-rise residential buildings and a prominent, grid-patterned high-rise. In the distance, a dense downtown core filled with skyscrapers and a visible construction crane stretches across the horizon, all framed by a majestic range of hazy blue mountains, some with snow-dusted peaks, under a partly cloudy blue sky. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the expansive environment and the grand scale of the city's integration with nature, rather than on any specific person or object. The shot is designed to convey a sense of place and atmosphere by capturing the relationship between the urban landscape and its natural surroundings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone slowly ascends over a lush, green residential neighborhood, offering a panoramic view of the Vancouver cityscape. In the distance, the downtown skyline, filled with numerous skyscrapers, is set against a vast mountain range, some of whose peaks are capped with snow. The foreground is dominated by a dense canopy of green trees, with the rooftops of low-rise and mid-rise apartment buildings visible among them, including a prominent, taller white residential building with a grid-like facade. The scene takes place during the day under a blue sky with scattered white clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a solid structural overview, it could be more precise about the visual dynamics and subject hierarchy. The statement \"no main subjects\" is undermined by the immediate focus on a \"prominent high-rise building,\" which clearly acts as the scene's primary visual anchor; acknowledging it as such would be more accurate. The description of the camera angle as \"level\" is questionable for an aerial shot, which is inherently a high-angle view; this should be corrected. The caption also misses an opportunity to describe the dynamic elements revealed during the camera's ascent. For instance, as the camera rises and reveals the streets in the middle ground, small moving vehicles become visible, adding a sense of scale and activity to the cityscape that is currently omitted. Lastly, the description of the mountain range filling a specific \"middle-upper sixth\" is too rigid; a more general term like \"occupying the upper horizon\" would better reflect how its relative position in the frame changes throughout the slow vertical movement.",
