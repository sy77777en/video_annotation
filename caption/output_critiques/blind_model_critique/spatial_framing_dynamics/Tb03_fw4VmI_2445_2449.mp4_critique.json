    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up of a person in a drysuit occupying the center foreground. In the middle ground, a black inflatable boat with several people is positioned from the center to the right side of the frame. A faint shoreline is visible in the background on the left. The camera, held at the subject's level, moves down with the person as they enter the water, shifting to a close-up of their face. From this water-level perspective, the boat and its occupants are now in the upper right middle ground. The shot then submerges, and the frame is completely filled with churning bubbles in the immediate foreground from an underwater viewpoint.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a person who initially appears on a kayak before entering the water, wearing a black full-body drysuit with an integrated hood and a white logo on the chest. The person is equipped with a black and yellow snorkel mask and has a matching yellow and black snorkel in their mouth. In the background, on a black inflatable boat, are several other people wearing red and black jackets with yellow hoods. One of these individuals is holding a smartphone. The video later transitions to an underwater perspective filled with air bubbles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a selfie POV shot, a person wearing a black drysuit, a hood, and a yellow-rimmed snorkel mask is shown in a choppy, dark body of water. The camera, initially above the surface, captures a black inflatable boat in the background with several people in red jackets aboard. The scene is set under a grey, overcast sky with a faint, possibly snow-dusted shoreline in the distance. The perspective then submerges, transitioning to an underwater view filled with churning white bubbles.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the main sequence of events, but it could be more precise about the nature of the camera movement and the final underwater scene. The description of the camera \"shifting to a close-up\" implies a separate zoom or cut, whereas the visual is more likely a single, continuous downward tilt where the person's movement naturally results in their face filling the frame as they enter the water. The caption also neglects to mention that the shoreline, visible at the start, is obscured and no longer in frame once the camera is at water level. Most significantly, the description ends with the frame being \"completely filled with churning bubbles,\" which is only a momentary effect of submersion. A more complete description would note that the bubbles quickly dissipate to reveal a clear underwater view, showing the person's body from the chest down as they begin to swim or descend into the darker water below, thus completing the transition from an above-water to an underwater perspective.",
