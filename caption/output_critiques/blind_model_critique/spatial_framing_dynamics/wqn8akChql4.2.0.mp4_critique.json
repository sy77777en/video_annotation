    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a man's back, which occupies the right side of the frame against a hazy, indistinct background on the left. The camera executes a slow, clockwise arc around the man, causing the shot to transition into a medium close-up that reveals his profile and then his face, keeping him positioned in the right foreground. As the camera moves, other figures emerge from the dust in the middle ground; a muscular, shirtless man becomes visible on the left, and another man in a dark tunic appears near the center. Indistinct shapes and figures are scattered across the background and lie on the ground. The camera continues its arc, moving slightly closer to the main subject, ending in a close-up of his face, which is now positioned in the right-center of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout the entire sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video centers on a white man with short, slicked-back blond hair and a light-colored beard. He is wearing a light brown, long-sleeved tunic with dark lacing on the shoulders over a white undershirt. Initially, only his back is visible, but as the camera arcs clockwise around him, his tense, sweaty face is revealed while he breathes heavily. In the dusty midground, other men become visible. One is a muscular, bald, and shirtless white man wearing dark pants and a wide, dark leather corset around his waist. Another man, also bald and with tattoos on his left arm, stands nearby wearing a dark, sleeveless tunic. Other indistinct figures are scattered in the background, some of whom appear to be lying on the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a hazy, outdoor area, possibly a courtyard or training ground, where the air is thick with swirling dust. This dusty atmosphere creates a muted, monochromatic color palette dominated by browns and grays, obscuring the background. Through the haze, indistinct figures and the faint outlines of stone structures or ruins are visible. The ground is uneven, covered in dirt and debris, suggesting a scene of recent activity or disarray.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up of a man's back. The camera arcs clockwise around the man, changing from a close-up to a medium close-up and finally to a close-up. Several people surround him, some fully and some partially visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the main camera movement and the subject's general positioning, it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and the environment. The description of the two men moving \"behind the main subject\" is too general; a more accurate description would be that they enter the left middle ground, walk parallel to the camera's arc, and exit the right middle ground, their movement creating a dynamic layer between the foreground subject and the background. The phrase \"hazy, indistinct background\" is also ambiguous; it should clarify if this is due to a shallow depth of field blurring the immediate surroundings or atmospheric haze creating a deep, obscured space. Furthermore, the caption fails to describe what the background on the right side of the frame looks like as the camera completes its arc, which is a key change in the spatial composition. Finally, describing the \"indistinct shapes and figures\" more specifically, for instance as \"motionless figures lying on the ground in the deep background,\" would provide crucial context about the scene's depth and setting without adding subjective interpretation.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up of a man's back, occupying the right side of the frame against a background blurred by a shallow depth of field, creating a soft, indistinct space on the left. The camera executes a slow, clockwise arc around the man, transitioning into a medium close-up that reveals his profile and then his face, maintaining his position in the right foreground. As the camera moves, two other figures enter the left middle ground, walking parallel to the camera's arc, and exit the right middle ground, adding a dynamic layer between the foreground subject and the background. A muscular, shirtless man becomes visible on the left, and another man in a dark tunic appears near the center. Motionless figures lie on the ground in the deep background, enhancing the scene's depth. As the camera completes its arc, the right side of the frame reveals a clearer view of the environment, with the main subject's face now in the right-center of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout the entire sequence.",
