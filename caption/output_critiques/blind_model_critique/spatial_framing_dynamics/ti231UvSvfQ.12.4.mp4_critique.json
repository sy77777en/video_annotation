    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a young man is positioned in the center-left of the frame, occupying the middle ground as he lies in a narrow bed. A light-colored vertical panel in the right foreground partially obstructs the view of the scene. The camera is positioned at the man's level. Initially, he lies on his side facing forward, and then he shifts slightly, moving his arm and turning his body away from the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with pale skin and short, very light blond hair is seen lying in a narrow bed. He is wearing a plain white t-shirt and is partially covered by a white comforter. Lying on his side, he has both hands placed forward beside the pillow, with his eyes wide open, looking forward with a focused and somewhat troubled expression, as if unable to sleep.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a small, sterile, and enclosed sleeping compartment with plain white walls. A narrow bed, made up with a white pillow and a white comforter, fills the confined space. The entire scene is rendered in a desaturated, cool-toned color palette, creating a nearly monochromatic and clinical atmosphere. The view is partially obstructed on the right side by a light-colored vertical panel. A person with very light blond hair, dressed in a white t-shirt, is seen lying awake in the bed before shifting their position slightly.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the medium shot and the subject's position in the middle ground, its description of his spatial arrangement is somewhat awkward. The phrase \"extending from the center-right toward the left edge\" is imprecise; it would be clearer to state that he lies diagonally across the frame, with his head in the upper-center-right and his body angled toward the bottom-left. The description of his movement as \"shifts slightly, moving his arm and turning his body\" is too vague. A more informative description would specify the action, for example, \"he then turns from his side onto his back, bringing his left arm up to rest behind his head.\" Additionally, the caption misses an opportunity to detail the spatial relationship of other elements, such as a pillow positioned under his head in the center-right or a white comforter that covers the lower half of his body in the bottom-left of the frame. Lastly, stating he is \"facing forward\" is ambiguous; \"facing the camera\" would be a more accurate description of his initial orientation.",
