    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, a large group of humanoid figures is arranged in neat rows, occupying the foreground, middle ground, and background of the scene. The formation of figures fills the frame, extending from the bottom left towards the top right. In the background, a small, house-shaped wooden structure stands centered against the far wall. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down on the entire group.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large group of mannequin-like humanoid figures stands at attention in neat rows. All the figures are dressed in identical orange jumpsuits with matching orange shoes. The majority of the figures have bald, grey, and featureless heads. Interspersed among them are several figures whose heads are distinguished by black and white abstract or striped patterns.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a large, dimly lit hall with dark, vertically paneled wooden walls and a dark tiled floor, numerous humanoid figures stand in organized rows. All figures are dressed in identical orange jumpsuits. While most have gray, featureless heads, some have faces with black and white patterns. In the background, against the far wall, stands a small, house-shaped wooden structure. A white text overlay at the bottom right corner of the screen reads \"[29,30]\".**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the primary camera movement and the general composition of the scene, but it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and the visual impact of the camera's motion. While it mentions the \"roughly rectangular pattern,\" it omits the figures' orientation; specifying that all figures in the group are standing rigidly and facing forward, away from the camera, would better define their collective spatial presence. The description of the camera movement is accurate, but it fails to describe the resulting change in perspective—the shot transitions from an eye-level view of the nearest figures, where they appear as individuals, to a high-angle shot where they merge into a vast, uniform pattern, emphasizing the scale of the group. Furthermore, the reveal of the final figure is vague; a more detailed description, such as \"the back of the head and right shoulder of a single figure is revealed,\" and noting its orientation (e.g., facing away from the main group toward the right wall) would provide a clearer understanding of its isolated position and its relationship to the other elements in the frame.",
