    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a jagged, crystalline structure positioned in the center-left of the frame, with its perfect reflection appearing directly below it on a dark surface in the foreground. The camera is positioned at eye level with this reflective surface. The scene then cuts to a low-angle full shot of two dark metal components against a black background. One component is in focus in the foreground at the bottom right, while the other is out of focus in the background at the top left. The camera remains static as additional chain-like elements emerge from the background and connect the two components.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a view of a dark, jagged, crystalline structure with multiple spires, featuring subtle grayish-blue highlights. The structure is perfectly reflected in a still, dark surface beneath it, creating a symmetrical image against a black backdrop. The perspective then shifts to a low-angle, close-up view of two similar dark metal components, one in focus and the other blurred. Additional metal components appear and connect the original two into a single entity. The completely black backdrop provides a stark contrast to the metallic elements, enhancing their intricate details.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a pitch-black, undefined space, a jagged, dark-colored formation with sections that appear grayish-blue is reflected perfectly on a still, dark surface below. The perspective then shifts to reveal two distinct dark components, resembling armor shards, that emerge abruptly, creating a sense of sudden appearance. Following this, several chain-like components become visible, connecting the two main components and adding complexity to the visual narrative. The entire scene is enveloped in near-total darkness, with only the initial jagged structure, its reflection, and the dark components that appear later being visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the three distinct phases of the video, but it could be more precise in its description of the visual dynamics and textures. In the first shot, calling the surface merely \"dark\" undersells its nature; it appears to be a perfectly reflective, glossy black plane, creating a stark, symmetrical composition that the caption only hints at. The transition between the first and second shots is described vaguely; a more accurate description would be a \"quick fade to black,\" which serves as a definitive break. For the second shot, stating it's \"challenging to ascertain the camera angle\" is an interpretation rather than a description; it would be better to state that the camera is positioned to create a floating, zero-gravity perspective on the two abstract metal components, which are more specifically angular and matte-finished. Furthermore, the camera isn't entirely static in this segment but performs a very slow, subtle orbit, which enhances the three-dimensional feel. Finally, in the last shot, while the camera becomes static, the description of the chains \"emerging\" is too gentle; they rapidly fire out as beams of light before solidifying into metallic links, a crucial dynamic detail that is currently missing.",
