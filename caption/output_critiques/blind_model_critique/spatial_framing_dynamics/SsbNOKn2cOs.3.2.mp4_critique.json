    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot from a high-angle, bird's-eye perspective, a man is positioned in the top-center of the frame. He is suspended in the foreground, with a black rope extending from his position down through the center of the frame. The background is entirely occupied by a vast valley far below, with a winding path visible snaking from the top right towards the center of the scene. The camera and the subject remain relatively static, emphasizing the extreme depth between the man in the foreground and the valley floor in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a bird's-eye view, a young man with fair skin and short, light brown hair is seen suspended in the air. He wears a dark, short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants. His body is curled forward as he looks ahead, gripping a thick black rope with his right hand, while his other hand is not visible. Another person, bald and wearing a black top and a mask, is holding the man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye view, the scene looks directly down into a vast, green valley during the daytime. The landscape below is a mix of green and brown vegetation covering rolling hills, with some exposed rocky ground. A narrow, winding path or dry riverbed meanders across the valley floor. A thick black rope descends from the bottom left to the center-left of the view, with a person in dark clothing suspended from it, positioned high above the ground. Another individual, bald and wearing a black top and a mask, appears to be holding the person suspended from the rope. The overall color palette is muted under what appears to be an overcast sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the two subjects' spatial relationship is imprecise; \"held by another person\" is vague for a bird's-eye view. It would be clearer to state if they are harnessed side-by-side or with one in front of the other, and to specify the position of the second person (e.g., \"to the left of the first man\"). The caption states the man is \"near the center,\" but with a clockwise camera rotation and the subjects \"swaying,\" their position within the frame would shift dynamically, likely moving from the center towards the right edge as they complete their arc; this movement is not described. Similarly, the black rope's position is described statically, but as the camera rotates, its perceived path across the frame would change, which should be noted. The description of the \"gray object falling\" is confusing; stating it is in the \"lower part of the background\" doesn't clarify its trajectory. It would be more accurate to describe it as falling from the subjects in the middle ground downwards through the frame toward the background valley floor, and to specify when this action occurs in the video. Finally, \"swaying\" might understate the motion; \"swinging in a wide arc\" would better complement the dynamic clockwise camera rotation.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a wide shot from a high-angle, bird's-eye perspective, two men are harnessed side-by-side, positioned near the top-center of the frame. As the camera rotates clockwise, they swing in a wide arc, shifting from the center towards the right edge of the frame. A black rope extends from their position, dynamically altering its path across the frame with the camera's movement. In the background, a vast valley stretches below, with a winding path visible snaking from the top right towards the center of the scene. A gray object falls from the subjects in the middle ground, descending through the frame towards the valley floor, adding to the sense of depth and motion.",
