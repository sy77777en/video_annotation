    "pre_caption": "From a static, high-angle full shot, the scene is captured from a top-down perspective, showing two people in separate, adjacent compartments. The frame is bisected by a central wall. One person is positioned on the left side of the frame, while the second person, holding a handgun, is on the right. Both subjects are stationary and occupy the same horizontal plane relative to the camera positioned directly above them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a bird's eye view, top-down perspective, two people are seen in separate, narrow, dimly lit compartments. The person on the right, with short dark hair, wears a dark jacket and holds a handgun with both hands, aiming it forward toward the left side of the frame. To the left, another person with short, dark, wet-looking hair parted down the middle is standing and looking toward the first person. This individual wears a dark jacket with a textured, possibly armband, pattern on the shoulder.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye-view, top-down perspective, the scene is set within two narrow, adjacent compartments separated by a thin wall. The dark, indoor environment is filled with a light haze or smoke. The compartment on the left is cast in a cool, blue light, obscuring most details. In contrast, the compartment on the right is more dimly lit, revealing a floor made of blank plywood with faint graffiti below it on the back wall. Two figures dressed in dark clothing are positioned within these confined spaces, one in each stall.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is a good start, accurately establishing the top-down perspective and the divided frame, but it lacks specificity and dynamic detail. The terms \"bird's-eye view\" and \"top-down perspective\" are redundant and could be consolidated for conciseness. The description of the subjects as \"two people\" with \"slight movements\" is too general. To better describe the spatial framing, the caption should specify their postures—for instance, is the person on the left lying prone near the bottom of their compartment, while the person on the right is kneeling in the center of theirs? The action of \"holding a handgun\" could be more descriptive, such as \"aiming a handgun toward a door at the bottom right of the frame,\" which would add a crucial dynamic element. Furthermore, the term \"compartments\" is vague; describing them as \"concrete rooms\" or \"office cubicles\" and mentioning other visible elements like a desk in the top left or debris on the floor would provide a richer understanding of the space. While the caption correctly identifies the subjects' 2D positions, it misses the opportunity to describe the spatial relationship between the subjects and other elements within their respective spaces, which is key to understanding the scene's composition and implied narrative.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene is captured from a bird's-eye view, showing two individuals in separate, adjacent concrete rooms divided by a central wall. On the left side of the frame, one person is lying prone near the bottom of their room, while on the right, another person is kneeling in the center, aiming a handgun toward a door at the bottom right of the frame. The rooms contain various elements, such as a desk in the top left corner and debris scattered on the floor, adding context to the environment. This composition highlights the spatial relationship between the subjects and their surroundings, enhancing the narrative tension.",
