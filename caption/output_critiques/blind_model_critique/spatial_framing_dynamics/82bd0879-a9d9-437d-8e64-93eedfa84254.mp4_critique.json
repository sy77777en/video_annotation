    "pre_caption": "From a stationary perspective inside a car, the camera captures a medium shot of the two front seats and a wide shot of the exterior scenery. The high-backed seats occupy the foreground on the left and right sides of the frame, with the car's dashboard and center console positioned in the center-middle ground. A person's silhouette is visible in the driver's seat on the right. Initially, the background, seen through the windshield, is a tunnel with yellow lights streaking past, indicating forward motion. The scene then transitions, and the background becomes a dark, rainy road, while raindrops appear on the windshield in the middle ground. The camera remains fixed at the level of the front seats throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a perspective inside a car looking forward, the two light-colored, high-backed front seats are prominently featured. The silhouette of an obscured person is visible in the driver's seat on the right, with a hand on the steering wheel. The car's dark dashboard and center console are partially lit by glowing gauges. The lighting transitions from a dim teal to a bright, warm yellow, and then returns to a dim teal, resembling the effect of driving through a tunnel, with raindrops visible on the windshield.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a forward-facing view inside a car at night, the scene captures the perspective as the vehicle travels at speed through a tunnel, where bright, yellow-orange lights on the walls blur into streaks. The car's interior, featuring tan seats and an illuminated dashboard, frames the view through the windshield. The scene then transitions to a dark, rainy road, where the windshield is covered in water and the exterior is cast in a dark, greenish light, with both the road ahead and the car's center console on the dashboard faintly visible.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is positioned inside a car, capturing a medium shot of the two front seats and an obscured person on the seat, and a wide shot of the scenery outside.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the fixed point-of-view from within the car and the general composition, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and framing. The description of a \"medium shot of the two front seats\" is slightly misleading; it would be clearer to state that the shot is framed by the seats in the foreground, which directs focus to the wide shot of the scenery through the windshield. The caption misses a key dynamic element: while it notes the appearance of raindrops, it fails to mention the windshield wipers, which I imagine are sweeping rhythmically from left to right across the middle ground, periodically clearing the view. The term \"transitions\" is too vague; specifying that the scene changes via a hard cut as the car exits the tunnel would be more informative. Furthermore, while the driver's silhouette on the right is mentioned, the caption omits the status of the passenger seat on the left, which I imagine is empty, creating an asymmetrical composition in the foreground. Finally, a rearview mirror, which I see positioned in the top center of the frame, is an unmentioned element that adds another layer of depth to the scene.",
