    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a blue race car is positioned in the center foreground, moving directly toward the camera along a roadway that extends from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground. Concrete barriers line the left and right sides of the road, receding from the foreground into the middle ground. The scene is framed by a large suspension bridge, with its towers located in the middle ground on the left and right sides and its cables stretching across the top of the frame. In the background, mountains are visible on the left. The camera is positioned at the car's level, providing a head-on perspective of its approach.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A blue, open-wheel formula-style race car is seen from a level, head-on perspective. The car has a sleek, aerodynamic body with a pointed nose cone prominently marked with a large red star. Its wide, black slick tires are exposed and connected to the chassis by suspension components. A driver, wearing a blue helmet, is seated in the open cockpit located behind the front axle. The vehicle is equipped with a front wing below the nose and a rear wing behind the driver.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a daytime outdoor scene, a blue open-wheel race car with a red star on its nose cone drives along the paved roadway of a large suspension bridge. The bridge's structure, including its tall towers, is painted dark blue, while the cables are green. Concrete barriers line the sides of the road, and hazy mountains are visible in the distance under a clear blue sky. The perspective is low to the ground, capturing the car head-on as it moves forward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the core elements, but it overlooks the primary dynamic of the video. While it starts as a full shot, the caption fails to describe the crucial transition where the car rapidly moves closer, changing the framing to a medium shot and then an extreme close-up as its front grille fills the screen, effectively ending the shot. The description of the bridge is also slightly inaccurate; the pylons are not just in the \"upper middle section\" but stand prominently on the left and right sides of the middle ground, creating a symmetrical frame for the road. Additionally, the caption mentions mountains on the left but omits the expansive, clear sky that fills the background on the right. Finally, specifying that the camera is static would be a valuable addition, as this lack of camera movement is what emphasizes the car's immense speed as it hurtles toward the fixed viewpoint.",
