    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot, framing two wingsuiters in the upper center of the frame and in the middle ground as they leap from a cliff. The camera is initially positioned below them, looking up. As the subjects descend, the camera tilts down to follow them, transitioning to an extreme wide shot from a high-angle, top-down perspective. In this final framing, the subjects, maintaining their vertical alignment with one above the other, move towards the center of the frame, gliding downwards through the middle ground against the vast cliff face that fills the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two people are shown in mid-air, gliding downwards while wearing specialized wingsuits. The suits are predominantly white with black sections on the shoulders, inner arms, and inner legs, and feature gold-colored patterns on the wing portions. Both individuals wear matching white and black helmets. They are positioned one above the other, holding their bodies horizontally with their arms and legs spread wide to catch the air.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a dynamic aerial perspective of a vast, rugged cliff face during the day. The sheer wall of light gray, weathered rock is textured with horizontal layers and crevices, with sparse green and brown vegetation clinging to the upper ledges under a partly cloudy blue sky. The camera initially captures two figures in white wingsuits leaping from the top before tilting downwards to follow their rapid descent, offering a top-down view as they fly in close proximity to the vertical rock wall.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the camera movement from a low-angle shot to a high-angle, top-down perspective by stating the camera \"tilts down\" is physically improbable. A simple tilt from a low position would not place the camera above the subjects; this significant change in perspective likely involves a hard cut to a second camera, possibly a drone, which the caption fails to mention. In the final shot, describing the subjects as being in the \"middle ground\" is confusing in a top-down view. It would be more accurate to state they are moving away from the camera and down along the vertical cliff face, which constitutes the background. Additionally, the description of their movement \"towards the center of the frame\" is imprecise without a starting point; specifying their trajectory, for instance, from the upper left towards the center, would be more informative. Finally, the initial positioning of the wingsuiters could be more detailed, as they might not be perfectly centered but perhaps slightly offset, with one positioned slightly in front of the other on the cliff edge before they leap.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing two wingsuiters near the upper center of the frame, slightly offset with one positioned slightly in front of the other on the cliff edge. As they leap, the camera, initially positioned below them, captures their descent. A hard cut transitions to a high-angle, top-down perspective, likely from a drone, providing an extreme wide shot. In this final view, the wingsuiters glide downwards along the vertical cliff face, which serves as the background.
