    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot from an overhead perspective, showing two sheets of paper positioned side-by-side in the middle ground on a wooden surface. The left sheet is in the left-center of the frame, and the right sheet is in the right-center. The camera then slowly zooms in, transitioning to a close-up that focuses on the central portion of the left-hand sheet. As the zoom progresses, a small yellow highlight box appears over the timestamp \"10:20\" on the left side of the page, and a larger yellow box simultaneously overlays a line of text in the center of the note. The camera maintains its position above the paper throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two sheets of white paper with handwritten notes in black ink are positioned on a light brown wooden surface. The notes on the left sheet are organized with timestamps, including \"9:43\" and \"10:20\". There are two yellow highlights: one emphasizes the timestamp \"10:20,\" and the other highlights the text \"authorized shoot down if necessary.\" The sheet on the right also contains handwritten notes with timestamps such as \"10:37\" and \"10:41\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Two sheets of white paper covered in black handwritten notes are laid out on a light brown wooden surface with a visible grain. The camera subtly shifts left while simultaneously panning right, then smoothly dollies forward and descends toward the note, tilting down as it approaches. A smaller yellow box highlights the timestamp \"10:20\" written on the page.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and the complex camera movement, but it could be more precise in its terminology and spatial details. The term \"full shot\" is typically used for human subjects; \"wide shot\" would be more appropriate for this overhead view of objects. Describing the papers as being in the \"middle ground\" is confusing for a flat, top-down perspective where traditional depth planes are not clearly established; simply stating their position on the surface would be clearer. The description of the camera movement as \"shifts left while simultaneously panning right\" is mechanically awkward; describing it as an \"arc\" or \"orbital motion\" would better convey the visual effect. Furthermore, the caption doesn't specify which of the two notes the camera focuses on until mentioning the highlights, and it fails to define the final shot size, which appears to transition from a wide shot to a close-up on the left-hand note. Finally, if other minor objects like a pen or a ruler were present on the wooden surface, mentioning their position would provide a more complete spatial context for the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video starts with a wide shot from an overhead perspective, showing two sheets of paper side-by-side on a wooden surface. The left sheet is positioned towards the left-center, and the right sheet towards the right-center of the frame. The camera then smoothly transitions in an arc motion, zooming in to focus on the left-hand sheet.

The camera maintains its overhead position throughout the shot. If present, additional objects like a pen or a ruler on the wooden surface are positioned around the papers, providing a complete spatial context.",
