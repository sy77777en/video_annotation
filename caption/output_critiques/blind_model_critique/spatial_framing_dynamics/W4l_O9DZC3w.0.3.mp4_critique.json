    "pre_caption": "A medium close-up shot centrally frames a woman from the chest up. She is positioned in the middle ground, standing within a field of dry grass that extends into the foreground. In the background, a series of large, rolling hills is visible across the landscape. The camera is positioned at the woman's eye level, maintaining a stable composition throughout the clip as she remains stationary, with only her hair moving in the wind.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned young woman with dark brown, shoulder-length hair and freckles across her face looks directly at the camera with a neutral expression. She wears prominent, bright blue winged eyeliner on her upper eyelids. Her layered outfit consists of a sheer, short-sleeved, button-up cardigan in a mustard-yellow color worn over a white t-shirt that has a black and blue graphic on the chest. Visible beneath the cardigan is a long sleeve with a blue-and-white scale-like design. Draped around her shoulder is a scarf-like ornament featuring a multicolored geometric pattern. She is accessorized with small, textured silver hoop earrings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds in a vast field of dry, golden-brown grass under a light blue sky with scattered white clouds. In the background, a series of large, rolling, arid hills with sparse green vegetation extends across the landscape. A woman with dark hair, which is being blown by the wind, stands in the center of the field.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the basic framing, but it could be more precise regarding the depth of field and environmental dynamics. While it correctly places the woman in the foreground, it could clarify the visual separation by noting that she is in sharp focus while the midground grass is softly blurred and the background hills are indistinct, which would better define the spatial depth. The description of the background is incomplete, as it omits the sky, which likely occupies the upper third of the frame above the hills. Additionally, the description of movement is limited to the woman's hair; a more comprehensive account would also mention that the tall grass in the midground is swaying in the wind, creating a more cohesive sense of motion throughout the scene. Finally, specifying the direction of the woman's gaze—for example, if she is looking slightly to the right of the camera—would add a key detail about her orientation within the frame.",
