    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a hand holding a scalpel is positioned in the foreground, occupying the bottom-left and central portions of the frame. The sharp, metallic tip of the scalpel is the primary point of focus, situated near the center. The background, which is heavily out of focus, initially shows indistinct shapes in a warmly lit indoor setting. As the shot progresses, the background transitions from being dimly lit to completely dark, isolating the hand and scalpel in the foreground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a close-up view with a shallow depth of field, a person's light-skinned hand is shown holding a small, silver, metallic tool. The tool, which resembles a scalpel or a craft knife, is held between the thumb and index finger. It features a slender, cylindrical handle and a very sharp, pointed blade at the tip, which is the central point of focus. The background is heavily blurred and indistinct.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a close-up shot with a shallow depth of field, a hand holds a silver, metallic precision knife with a sharp, pointed blade. The heavily blurred background shows indistinct shapes in a lit indoor setting with warm tones, which gradually becomes dim and dark.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the close-up shot and the general positioning of the hand and scalpel, it could be more precise. The description of the hand's position as \"bottom-left and central\" is vague; a more accurate description might be that the wrist is anchored in the bottom-left, with the scalpel handle angling diagonally across the center of the frame. The caption also misses a key dynamic detail: if the hand is held perfectly still, this lack of movement is a significant element that creates tension and should be mentioned. Furthermore, the term \"transitions\" પોલીસ generic; a more descriptive verb, such as \"smoothly fades,\" would better articulate how the background lighting changes. Finally, specifying the type of hand, for instance, if it is wearing a blue nitrile glove, would provide important visual context that is currently missing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a close-up shot, a hand wearing a blue nitrile glove holds a scalpel, with the wrist anchored in the bottom-left corner and the scalpel handle angling diagonally across the center of the frame. The sharp, metallic tip of the scalpel is the primary point of focus, situated near the center. The hand remains perfectly still, creating a palpable tension. The background, initially showing indistinct shapes in a warmly lit indoor setting, smoothly fades from dimly lit to completely dark, isolating the hand and scalpel in the foreground.
