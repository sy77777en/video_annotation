    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man is positioned in the foreground on the right side of the frame, appearing out of focus. His reflection is visible in the middle ground on the left side of the frame and is in sharp focus. A vertical line divides the center of the frame. Initially, the man's head is bowed as he splashes water on his face. He then lowers his hands and raises his head to look forward, bringing his face in the reflection into full view. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young adult man with fair skin and short, white hair is shown in a close-up, looking at his reflection in a mirror. He is wearing a gray crewneck shirt over a white t-shirt. He first splashes water on his face with both hands. He then lowers his hands and stares intently at his reflection, his light-colored eyes wide and his face appearing somewhat gaunt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene, presented with a desaturated and cool-toned color palette, is set in a room with plain, light-colored walls. A man is positioned in front of a mirror, where he splashes water on his face before looking up at his reflection. The video is framed with black bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the key elements and the use of a reflection as the focal point, but it could be more precise. The term \"close-up\" might be misleading; a \"medium close-up\" would better describe a shot that includes the man's out-of-focus shoulder and head in the foreground right. The description of the reflection's position as being \"on both the left side and the center\" is confusing; it would be clearer to state that the reflection occupies the center-left portion of the frame. The \"vertical line\" is mentioned without depth, but in the video, it is clearly the edge of the mirror cabinet and is therefore in the middle ground with the reflection. Furthermore, the caption misses that the background of the reflection shows a blurred, tiled wall. The description of the camera movement as \"moves slightly\" is too vague; the camera actually performs a slow, subtle push-in toward the reflection, which intensifies the moment the man raises his head. Finally, stating he \"brings his face in the reflection into full view\" is a bit redundant; a more active description would be that he raises his head to meet his own gaze in the mirror, shifting the emotional focus of the shot.",
