    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of the background sky and clouds filling the entire frame. A small figure, captured in an extreme wide shot, then enters from the top of the frame, slightly right of center, and falls vertically downwards through the middle ground. As the figure descends, the camera tilts down, revealing the dark silhouettes of treetops in the foreground at the bottom left and houses across the bottom of the frame. The figure continues its downward trajectory through the center of the frame, eventually disappearing behind the foreground houses. Throughout the action, the camera is positioned below the falling figure, and the shot concludes with the background sky in the upper portion of the frame and the foreground silhouettes at the bottom.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In this black-and-white video, a small, dark silhouette of a person is seen falling against a cloudy sky. The human-like figure, viewed from a great distance, maintains a consistent orientation as it descends, with its head, torso, and limbs visible in outline. The person ultimately disappears from view behind the dark silhouette of the houses located at the bottom of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This black and white outdoor scene captures a view of an overcast sky with dense, gray clouds drifting slowly across the expanse. As the camera tilts downward, the dark silhouettes of treetops become visible in the lower left corner of the frame, while rooftops appear in the lower section. The entire scene is rendered with a fine, uniform dot pattern overlay, giving it a grainy, textured quality.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: At the beginning, the frame shows only the sky. Then, a person falls from above into the frame, showing in an extreme wide shot, and the camera continuously tilts down, following the object’s descent. Finally, the object drops behind a house and disappears from the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. When the subject appears, the camera is positioned below them, and the subject disappears by the end of the video.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively describes the camera's tilt and the layering of foreground, midground, and background elements, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics of the main subject. The description of the figure entering \"slightly right of center\" and then falling \"through the center\" is ambiguous; it should clarify whether the camera pans slightly left to re-center the subject or if the figure itself drifts horizontally. Furthermore, the caption states the figure is captured in an \"extreme wide shot\" but doesn't mention if its size in the frame changes. As the figure falls, it would likely appear to grow slightly larger, transitioning from an extreme wide to a very wide shot, a detail that is central to its spatial movement. Lastly, the description of \"houses\" in the foreground could be more specific; clarifying if these are also dark silhouettes, like the treetops, or if they are just the roofs would enhance the visual accuracy of the description.",
