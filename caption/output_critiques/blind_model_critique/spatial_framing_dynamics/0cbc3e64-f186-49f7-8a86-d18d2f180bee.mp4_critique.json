    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a woman is positioned in the center-right of the frame, running in the middle ground on a red track that occupies the bottom of the frame. As she runs from right to left, the camera pans to follow her, keeping her relatively centered. In the middle ground and background behind her, a concrete wall and empty bleachers scroll from right to left. The camera is positioned at the woman's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black woman with her black hair pulled back in a ponytail is running. She wears a white headband, a white and grey zigzag-patterned athletic crop top, and black athletic shorts with three white vertical stripes on the side. She has a focused expression with her mouth slightly open as she runs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at an outdoor running track on an overcast day. A red, all-weather track is in the midground, in front of a long, gray concrete wall. Behind the wall, a section of empty, silver-colored metal bleachers with railings is visible. A woman wearing a white headband, a patterned crop top, and dark shorts runs along the track as the camera moves to follow her movement. The entire video is framed by black letterbox bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the woman's initial movement within the frame is contradictory; stating she \"shifts to the right side before settling in the center-right\" while running from right to left is illogical. Based on the video, she enters the frame from the right and the camera immediately begins a tracking shot, positioning her in the center-right of the frame to create lead room for her movement, a position she maintains throughout. The caption is also inconsistent, first stating she settles \"center-right\" and later that the camera keeps her \"relatively centered.\" The former is more accurate. Furthermore, the description of the track as being \"at the bottom of the frame and in the middle ground\" is confusing; it would be clearer to state that the track extends from the foreground at the bottom of the frame into the middle ground. Finally, specifying the camera movement as a \"tracking shot\" rather than just saying it \"moves to follow her\" would more precisely describe the dynamic where the camera travels parallel to the subject.",
