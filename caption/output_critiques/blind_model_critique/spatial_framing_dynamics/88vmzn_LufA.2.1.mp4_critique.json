    "pre_caption": "From a top-down, wide-shot perspective, a convoy of four light blue vehicles is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground as they travel along a solid red path that extends horizontally across the scene. In the upper-center, a static white speech bubble overlay points down at the second vehicle from the left, which is highlighted with a glow. The background consists of a black road with white dashed lines and a dark grey grid pattern. The entire convoy moves uniformly from left to right, and as the lead vehicle exits the frame on the right, a new vehicle enters from the left. This movement causes the highlighted vehicle's position within the convoy to shift from second to third from the left, while the static text overlay's pointer continues to track it across the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A top-down animated graphic displays three light blue SUVs and one light blue sedan in a single file line on a solid red path. The second SUV from the left is highlighted with a bright, glowing light blue aura. Eventually, the sedan exits the frame, and a new SUV enters from the left, making the initially highlighted SUV the third from the left. Above this convoy, a white, rectangular speech bubble overlay contains the words \"COUNTER ASSAULT TEAM\" in a bold, blue, sans-serif font, with a pointer directed at the glowing vehicle. The entire scene is set against a black background representing a road with white dashed lines and a stylized dark grey grid pattern on either side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a top-down animated graphic, a convoy of vehicles travels from left to right. The convoy consists of a sedan followed by three light-blue, stylized SUVs. They move along a solid red road set against a black background, with white dashed lines and stylized dark gray grid patterns on both sides. The second vehicle from the left, an SUV, is distinguished by a bright blue, glowing aura. Positioned in the upper-middle of the scene, a white speech bubble overlay points to this glowing vehicle, containing the words \"COUNTER ASSAULT TEAM\" in bold, blue, sans-serif text. As the scene progresses, the sedan exits the frame, and a new SUV enters from the left, making the glowing SUV the third vehicle from the left.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the basic elements and movement, but it misses key spatial details and misinterprets the dynamic positioning of the highlighted vehicle. The video is filmed from a high-angle, not just a wide shot, which is why the grid pattern on the road is clearly visible. The entire scene, including the red path and the vehicles, is positioned in the middle ground against a flat, dark grey background, a detail the caption omits. The most significant error is the description of the highlighted vehicle's position shifting \"from second to third from the left\"; this is incorrect. The highlighted vehicle remains the second vehicle in the original convoy. As the lead vehicle exits right and a new, un-highlighted vehicle enters from the left, the highlighted vehicle becomes the third vehicle *currently visible within the frame*, but its position *within the convoy* is unchanged. The caption also fails to mention that the white speech bubble in the upper-center is static, and only its pointer dynamically extends and pivots to track the highlighted vehicle. Furthermore, the \"glow\" is not just a highlight but a steady, bright yellow aura that clearly distinguishes the vehicle from the others.",
