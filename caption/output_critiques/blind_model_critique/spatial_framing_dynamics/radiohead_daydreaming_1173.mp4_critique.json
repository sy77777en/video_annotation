    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground against a textured wall in the background. Initially, his head is tilted back as he looks upward, toward the top of the frame. He then slowly lowers his head, bringing his gaze down and slightly to the right side of the frame. The camera remains stationary and positioned at the subject's level throughout this movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with light skin, long straight brown hair that reaches past his shoulders, and a full beard with some gray. He appears to be in his late 30s to early 50s. He is wearing a light gray jacket over a gray shirt. Initially, he tilts his head upward, then gradually lowers it to a horizontal position, shifting his gaze from upward to downward. His posture remains upright, and he is consistently oriented toward the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene is characterized by a background of neutral-toned, textured walls. The wall surface consists of concrete block walls and horizontal metal structures. Behind the figure, and rising with him, is a section with a perforated, mesh-like texture. The lighting is diffuse, creating a muted color palette. A man is positioned in the center of the scene, his head moving as he looks up and then shifts his gaze.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the camera's movement contains a contradiction: if the camera moves upward as the subject's head lowers, it is not \"remaining at the subject's level\" but is instead tilting up, changing its vertical angle relative to his face. The spatial distinction between the \"midground\" mesh and the \"background\" wall is also unclear for what is likely a shallow-depth-of-field close-up; it would be more accurate to describe the mesh as being positioned directly against the wall or as an integral part of its texture. The caption could also be more specific about the shot size by stating it is a head-and-shoulders close-up. Furthermore, the description of the man's movement is slightly vague; it could be improved by specifying if his entire head turns to the left or if only his eyes shift in that direction. Finally, the framing might be more dynamic than described, as it's common for a subject to shift slightly off-center for compositional balance when their gaze moves, a detail that is currently missing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a head-and-shoulders close-up, a man is positioned slightly off-center in the frame, occupying the foreground against a textured wall. The wall features a mesh that appears as an integral part of its texture. Initially, his head is tilted back as he looks upward toward the top of the frame. As he slowly lowers his head, his eyes shift slightly to the right side of the frame. The camera remains stationary, maintaining a consistent angle relative to the subject's face throughout this movement.",
