    "pre_caption": "In this wide shot, a person is initially seen falling upside down in the bottom right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground against a pale sky, while a helicopter is visible in the top left background. The camera is positioned below the falling person, looking up. As the person continues to fall, the helicopter moves out of the top left of the frame. Simultaneously, the camera tilts downward to follow the person's descent, causing the person to move from the bottom to the upper portion of the frame. This camera movement also shifts the perspective, so the camera is now positioned above the subject, looking down as they fall.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An individual is shown falling upside down, wearing dark pants and a dark top that includes a light-colored parachute backpack. The person is wearing dark shoes or boots. In the upper left portion of the scene, a dark-colored helicopter is visible, which later goes out of view in the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor scene set against a vast, pale pink sky, a person is seen falling downward. Initially, the dark silhouette of a helicopter is visible in the upper left corner, but it exits the frame as the camera tilts downward. This reveals a landscape featuring a wide blue sea and a winding coastline.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the camera and subject movement contains a significant logical inconsistency. While the initial setup is clear, the explanation of the dynamic shift is flawed. The caption claims a downward camera tilt causes the perspective to change from being below the subject to being above them. A simple tilt cannot achieve this; it only changes the camera's angle, not its physical position relative to the subject in 3D space. For the camera to move from a low-angle to a high-angle position, the cameraperson must have physically fallen past the subject, a crucial piece of spatial dynamic that is entirely omitted. Furthermore, the description of the subject moving from the \"center to the bottom, and then to the upper portion\" is confusing and contradicts the action of a camera tilting down to follow a subject, which would typically push the subject towards the top of the frame. A more accurate description would state that the camera, falling at a faster rate, overtakes the subject, causing the viewing angle to shift from low to high and the subject to move from the top to the bottom of the frame as they are passed. The caption also fails to mention the dramatic change in the background from the initial \"pale sky\" to the ground, which would become visible as the camera reorients to look down.",

The camera is positioned below the falling person, looking up. As the person continues to fall, the helicopter moves out of the top left of the frame. The camera, falling at a faster rate, overtakes the person, causing the perspective to shift from below to above the subject.

The background also changes dramatically from the pale sky to the ground, which becomes visible as the camera captures the descent from a high-angle view.",
