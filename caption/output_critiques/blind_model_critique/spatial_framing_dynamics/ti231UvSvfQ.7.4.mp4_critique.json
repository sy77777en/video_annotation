    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of a young man in the left foreground. In the center middle ground, an out-of-focus individual sits at a table. The camera then slowly pushes in on the man while simultaneously panning to the right, transitioning the shot into an extreme close-up of his profile, which comes to occupy the left and center of the frame. This movement causes the person in the middle ground to move out of the frame to the left, while another person becomes visible in the right background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video focuses on a young, light-skinned man with short, light-colored hair, who is seated in the foreground. He is wearing a dark blue sweatshirt over a white t-shirt. His face is shown in close-up with wide eyes and a furrowed brow as he stares forward and slightly to his left. In the background and out of focus, an individual with dark, pulled-back hair and a dark jacket sits at a table. As the camera's perspective shifts to the right, another person wearing a pink long-sleeved shirt with their arms crossed becomes visible in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a dimly lit, sparsely furnished room with a desaturated, cool-toned color scheme. A large, light-colored table in the center of the room has a folder and a pen on its surface. In the background, the plain grey walls are adorned with what appear to be indistinct diagrams. A young man with short, light-colored hair is positioned in the foreground, obscuring an individual wearing dark clothing seated at the table. A red object is visible in the far background. As the camera slowly pushes in and pans, shifting from a close-up of the man's face to a tight profile view, another person dressed in pink clothing enters from the right side of the frame and is eventually obscured by the man.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the basic camera movement and subject placement, but it misses a key dynamic of the main subject and could be more precise about the final composition. The description states the shot transitions to an extreme close-up of the man's profile, but it omits that the man himself slowly turns his head to the right during the camera's push-in, an action that motivates the camera's corresponding pan. This combined movement creates a feeling of following his shifting attention. Furthermore, the final framing could be described more cohesively; instead of just stating the man is on the left and a new person is on the right, it would be clearer to state that the final shot is a composition with the man's profile occupying the left third of the frame, leaving the out-of-focus middle ground, now containing the second individual, to fill the remaining right side. The description of the initial middle-ground person as \"slightly to the left of the center\" is also slightly awkward; \"in the center-left middle ground\" would be more concise.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a young man in the left foreground. In the center-left middle ground, an out-of-focus individual sits at a table. As the camera slowly pushes in on the man, he gradually turns his head to the right, prompting the camera to pan in the same direction. This coordinated movement creates a sense of following his shifting attention. The shot transitions into an extreme close-up of his profile, which occupies the left third of the frame. The person in the middle ground moves out of the frame to the left, while another individual becomes visible in the right background, filling the remaining right side of the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout.",
