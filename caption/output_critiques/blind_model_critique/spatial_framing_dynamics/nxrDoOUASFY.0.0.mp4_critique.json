    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a green card positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground against a blurred background that includes a vertical turquoise neon light on the left. The card descends toward the bottom center of the frame while the neon light moves out of the frame to the left. As the card drops, a hand enters from the bottom center, moving into the foreground to catch it. The shot then transitions to a close-up, ending with the card held by fingers in the foreground at the bottom center of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A metallic green, rectangular card is the central subject. It features white text reading \"chime\" on the right side and \"VISA\" on the left, with additional, hard-to-discern text next to \"VISA.\" A small, dark, square chip is visible near its top edge. Initially, the card drops down, and a light-skinned hand with manicured, natural-looking nails catches it between its fingers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an urban setting, a green, metallic card is captured in mid-air. The rectangular card, which is the central focus, has a reflective surface. It is marked with the word 'chime' in white lowercase letters on the right side and 'VISA' in white uppercase letters on the left, with additional text that is difficult to read. A small, dark, square chip is visible near the top edge. The background and midground are blurred, showing indistinct shapes and vibrant artificial lights. A prominent turquoise neon light on the left quickly moves out of frame, and there appears to be a person serving something, suggesting the presence of a food store.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video first shows a full shot of a card. As it descends, a hand appears holding it, with only the fingers visible at the bottom center of the frame, before ending with a close-up shot of the card and the hand.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the core sequence of events, but it could be more precise in its terminology and description of dynamics. The term \"full shot\" is generally used for a person and is likely inaccurate for a small object like a card; \"medium close-up\" would better describe the initial framing. The statement that the \"neon light moves out of the frame\" is ambiguous; it's more plausible that the camera pans slightly to the right, causing the static light to exit on the left, a key detail of camera movement that is missing. A significant omission is the nature of the transition to the final shot; specifying whether it's a hard cut or a digital zoom is crucial for describing the video's dynamics. Finally, the description of the final shot could be more detailed; for instance, instead of just \"held by fingers,\" it could specify \"pinched between the thumb and index finger at its top edge,\" which would provide a clearer image of the final composition.",
