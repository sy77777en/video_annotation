    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman is initially framed in the center of the middle ground, with the camera tilted at a Dutch angle. In the background, large architectural structures with arched openings are visible. The camera then rotates to a level position, correcting the tilt so that the woman and the background are oriented upright. Throughout this movement, the woman remains centrally positioned in the middle ground, and the camera stays at her level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with a light to medium skin tone and long, dark, wet-look hair is shown from a level angle. She wears large, silver-colored hoop earrings and a white outfit composed of a structured corset top, long sleeves made of a fishnet-like material, and a textured, voluminous, layered long skirt. Throughout the video, she looks up toward the camera, at times smiling and at other times with her mouth open as if singing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place in a softly lit room with large, light-colored architectural structures featuring tall, arched openings. The background displays a gradient of muted blue and pink tones, suggesting a stylized or painted sky. The walls are smooth and pale, with two prominent arches that have carved face-like symbols—one with a frown and one with a smile—adding a distinctive visual element. A person with long, dark, wet hair and wearing a white outfit is positioned centrally, seated in front of the arches. The lighting creates gentle shadows and highlights, emphasizing the geometric shapes and the texture of the person’s clothing. No overlays such as text, icons, or watermarks are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the medium shot, the Dutch angle, and the corrective camera roll. However, it could be more precise about the spatial composition. For instance, the \"large architectural structures\" in the midground are described without their 2D position; they might stretch horizontally from the left to the right of the frame, a significant detail for understanding the scene's composition. The description of the woman as \"centrally positioned\" might be an oversimplification; she could be positioned slightly off-center, perhaps on the right third of the frame, to create a more balanced composition with the architecture behind her. Furthermore, the description of the camera movement could be enhanced by specifying the direction of the initial tilt and the subsequent rotation (e.g., \"initially tilted left, the camera rotates clockwise to a level position\"). Finally, while the description of the background is appropriately cautious, if any soft-focus shapes like a treeline or clouds were visible, mentioning them would add context without being speculative.",
