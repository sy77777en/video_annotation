    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a man on the floor, positioned in the foreground and slightly left of the frame's center. A long, dimly lit corridor extends from the center into the deep background. As the man gets up and moves forward into the middle ground, a second man appears from the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground. The shot tightens to a medium shot as they begin to fight in the center of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, follows their rapid, shaky movements as they grapple, with one man being pushed against a wall on the right side of the frame, while the corridor remains visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two men in a dimly lit, narrow corridor. Initially, one man with dark hair, wearing a dark jacket over a dark shirt and dark pants, is seen on his hands and knees on the floor. He struggles to his feet and moves forward, at which point a second man appears. This second man is also dressed in dark clothing. The two men immediately engage in a physical fight, with the first man throwing punches at the second man, who is wielding a knife against him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds in a long, narrow, and dimly lit corridor at night, where the lighting casts a cold, greenish hue. Smoke is visible in the background, and debris is scattered along the edge of the corridor. The walls appear dark, with one side possibly made of brick, and the floor is concrete. Two figures dressed in dark clothing are engaged in a fight, adding dynamic motion to the scene. Initially, the background has a shaky, blurry effect, but it becomes clear in the latter half of the video. The video is framed with black bars at the top and bottom, creating a widescreen presentation.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a full shot of a man on the floor struggling to get up. After he manages to stand up, he charges forward, and the shot reveals another man striking back. As they struggle, the camera captures the scene with medium shots. \n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation but could be more precise about the spatial dynamics. The initial description of the man on the floor in the \"center foreground\" who then \"moves forward into the foreground\" is contradictory; it would be clearer if he started in the center middle ground and then moved toward the camera into the foreground, which would better establish the depth of the corridor. The appearance of the second man \"from the right side\" is vague; specifying that he steps out of a darkened doorway on the right, for instance, would add more detail to the spatial interaction. The description of the shot \"tightening\" to a medium shot could be improved by clarifying the camera action, such as a rapid dolly-in, which would enhance the sense of immediacy. While the caption notes the fight occurs in the center, it misses the opportunity to describe their movement across the frame; for example, their struggle could cause them to drift from the center to the left side. Lastly, stating one man is \"knocked backward\" is incomplete; describing his final position, such as being thrown against the left wall and sliding into the middle ground, would provide a more comprehensive account of the spatial changes during the action.",
