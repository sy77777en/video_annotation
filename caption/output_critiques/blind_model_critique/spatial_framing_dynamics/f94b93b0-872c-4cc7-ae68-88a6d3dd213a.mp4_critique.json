    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, captured from the subjects' level, showing a central figure in the middle ground, positioned in the center of the frame. This person is flanked by two silhouetted figures in the foreground, one occupying the bottom left and the other the bottom right. As the camera moves forward, following the central figure walking away down a hallway, the two foreground figures move out of the frame to the left and right. This action transitions the shot into a medium close-up that remains focused on the central figure, who stays in the center of the frame as they proceed into the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with very long, straight, blonde hair is seen from the back, walking ahead of two other individuals. The central person wears a dark jacket and initially appears as a dark silhouette, similar to the others, but becomes clearly visible by the end. The two individuals behind are visible only from the back, with just parts of their shoulders and heads discernible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins with dim lighting, gradually transitioning to moderate lighting as the central figure moves from a shadowed area into a well-lit section of a long, narrow indoor hallway. The over-the-shoulder POV shows the camera positioned behind a character with long, straight blonde hair, capturing their upper body and the scene ahead. The dimly lit corridor is illuminated by rectangular fluorescent lights on the ceiling, casting a warm, yellowish glow and creating alternating patches of light and shadow. Light-colored walls are lined with closed doors, and a red object, likely a fire hydrant, is mounted on the left wall. The camera follows the central figure, flanked by two other partially visible figures in silhouette. As they walk down the corridor, one figure on the right eventually exits the frame, while the figure on the left remains partially visible in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I've just watched.\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the main action and subjects, it could be more precise about their spatial relationships and the dynamics of the camera movement. The initial depth of the two silhouetted figures is not specified; it only places the central figure in the middle ground. It would be clearer to state that the silhouetted figures are in the foreground, which would better explain why the left figure remains there as the camera advances. The description of the central figure walking \"away\" is also slightly misleading, as the camera's forward movement keeps them at a relatively consistent distance, causing the shot to tighten from a medium shot to a medium close-up, rather than having the figure recede into the background. Furthermore, describing the left figure as simply \"partially visible\" undersells the visual effect; as the camera dollies forward, this foreground figure creates a parallax effect, wiping across the left edge of the frame. A more accurate description would clarify the initial foreground position of the side figures and describe the camera's movement as a dolly-in that overtakes the subject's walking pace, creating the tightening frame and the parallax motion of the foreground element.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium shot at the subjects' level, featuring a central figure in the middle ground, positioned in the center of the frame. Two silhouetted figures are in the foreground, one on the bottom left and the other on the bottom right. As the camera performs a dolly-in, moving forward and overtaking the central figure's walking pace down a hallway, the two foreground figures move out of the frame to the left and right. This action transitions the shot into a medium close-up, maintaining focus on the central figure, who remains centered in the frame. The left foreground figure creates a parallax effect, wiping across the left edge of the frame, enhancing the visual dynamics as the camera advances.",
