    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot, showing the man's silhouetted upper body in the left-middle foreground, positioned next to a truck that occupies the right side of the frame. As he opens the door and moves into the vehicle, he is briefly obscured by the truck's frame in the middle ground. The shot then transitions to a close-up from inside the cab, placing the man in profile on the right side of the frame in the foreground. In the final framing, the steering wheel is visible in the bottom-left foreground, with the dark exterior seen in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, seen in silhouette from behind, wears a dark, long-sleeved shirt and a baseball cap as he opens the door to a light-colored, older model pickup truck with a camper shell. After he enters the vehicle, the view shifts to a close-up of him inside the dimly lit cab. He is now seen in profile, sitting in the driver's seat and looking forward, with the warm interior light partially illuminating his face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, outdoor setting at night, a silhouetted figure wearing a cap opens the door to a light-colored, older-model pickup truck that has a camper shell. As the person enters the vehicle and closes the door, the truck's interior is faintly illuminated by a warm, yellow light, revealing a steering wheel and a rearview mirror against the surrounding darkness.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a man getting into a car from behind. At first, his upper body is in the left-middle frame; as he gets in, he is briefly obscured by the car. Then the camera moves, finally showing a close-up shot of him in the driver's seat.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the change in shot size and the subject's general movement, but it lacks some specificity that would enhance its clarity. The term \"left-middle\" is imprecise; \"left of center\" would be a clearer description of the man's initial position. The description of the transition is incomplete, as it should specify that it is a hard cut to the interior shot. Furthermore, the initial framing could be described more dynamically; rather than the truck simply \"occupying the right side,\" it likely dominates the foreground and middle ground, with the silhouetted man positioned beside its cab. The phrase \"obscured by the truck's frame\" is also slightly vague and could be improved by specifying if it's the door or the A-pillar that blocks the view. Lastly, the description of the second shot is static; it misses the opportunity to describe potential actions, such as the man starting the vehicle, which would cause the dashboard to illuminate in the middle ground, adding a key dynamic element to the final framing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium shot, showing the man's silhouetted upper body positioned left of center in the foreground, next to a truck that dominates the right side of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. As he opens the door and moves into the vehicle, he is briefly obscured by the truck's A-pillar. The shot then transitions with a hard cut to a close-up from inside the cab, placing the man in profile on the right side of the frame in the foreground. In this shot, the steering wheel is visible in the bottom-left foreground, and as the man starts the vehicle, the dashboard lights up in the middle ground, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The dark exterior remains visible in the background, with the camera maintaining the subject's eye level throughout.",
