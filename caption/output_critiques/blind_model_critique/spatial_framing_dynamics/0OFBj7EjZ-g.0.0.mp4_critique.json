    "pre_caption": "This static, top-down wide shot captures a snowy urban landscape from a high angle. A street with tram tracks runs vertically through the center of the frame in the middle ground. A long tram, also in the center middle ground, moves from the top of the frame towards the bottom, surrounded by cars traveling in both directions. A snow-covered cemetery occupies the left side of the frame in the middle ground. On the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground, are buildings and a lot with parked cars. A text overlay is fixed in the bottom-left corner of the frame in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An aerial, top-down view shows a city street blanketed in snow. In the center of the frame, a long, dark gray, multi-sectioned tram travels along tracks that run down the middle of a dark, wet road. The tram is surrounded by numerous cars, most of which are white, black, or gray, with snow dusting their roofs and hoods. To the left of the road is a snow-covered cemetery, where the outlines of graves and headstones are visible beneath the white layer. To the right, multi-story buildings with snow-covered, gabled roofs line the street, with a row of parked cars, also covered in snow, situated in a lot beside them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a top-down view of a snowy urban landscape. A dark street with tram tracks runs vertically through the center, flanked by a snow-covered cemetery on the left and buildings with snow-dusted rooftops on the right. Traffic, including several cars and a multi-section tram, is visible on the street. A blanket of white snow covers the ground, bare trees, and buildings. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the date and time in white text as \"December 15th, 2022\" and \"4:00 PM CET\", along with a small label \"[1]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and their general movement, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and camera work. The term \"bird's eye view\" is a good start, but it doesn't clarify if it's a true top-down perspective or a high-angle shot; a high-angle shot would show the sides of the tram and buildings, creating a sense of depth that the caption currently ignores. The description of the camera \"following the tram's path\" is vague. A more accurate description would be that the camera tracks forward, keeping the tram centered in the frame, which causes the surrounding cemetery and buildings to scroll downwards and out of the frame. The caption lists the 2D positions of elements but fails to use 3D depth terms like \"middle ground,\" where all the visible action and scenery exist relative to the high-angle camera. Furthermore, the description of the two cars is simplistic; it could specify if they enter and exit the frame or if their speed relative to the tram causes their position within the frame to shift. Finally, instead of just listing static elements, the caption should describe how their position changes in relation to the camera's movement, providing a more dynamic picture of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This high-angle, bird's eye view shot captures a snowy urban landscape with a sense of depth. The camera tracks forward, keeping a long tram centered in the frame as it moves from the top towards the bottom, creating a dynamic scene where the surrounding snow-covered cemetery on the left and buildings with a parking lot on the right scroll downwards and out of view. The tram travels along a street with tram tracks running vertically through the middle ground, flanked by cars moving in both directions. Some cars enter and exit the frame, while others shift position relative to the tram's speed. A text overlay remains fixed in the bottom-left corner of the frame, providing a static point of reference amidst the motion.",
