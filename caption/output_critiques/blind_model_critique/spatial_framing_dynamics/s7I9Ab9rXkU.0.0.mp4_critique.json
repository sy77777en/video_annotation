    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, showing the upper half of a man in the bottom left foreground and the head of a woman in the bottom center foreground. A camera on a tripod stands in the far-left foreground, while a large, three-panel studio light occupies the right foreground and midground. Positioned between the two people, a black keyboard sits in the foreground. In the midground, a backdrop of stacked wooden crates and a central blue banner for \"Henry Westons\" is visible behind the subjects. The background consists of a white tent ceiling in the upper frame, a horizontal light bar in the upper center, and black curtains on the left. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, executes a slow downward tilt, gradually revealing the full seated figures of the man and woman, transitioning the composition into a full shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a temporary video studio set up inside a tent, a man and a woman are positioned with an electronic organ between them. The video begins with a low-angle shot capturing the man's upper body and the woman's head. The man, on the left and slightly in front, has short, dark hair and is wearing a light-colored button-down shirt, dark blue jeans, and a lanyard around his neck. He is sitting on a stool, holding a black, white, and blue paper cup with a white lid, and turns his body to his left to face the woman. The woman, positioned in the lower-middle part of the frame, has long, straight blonde hair and is wearing a light gray and dark gray striped woolen coat over a black and gray sweater. She is seated at a black keyboard, looking toward the man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene is set up for a video recording inside a large white tent with a fabric ceiling. The backdrop is styled with stacked wooden crates, burlap fabric, and a prominent blue banner for \"Henry Westons Exceptional Cider\" that features a portrait of a man. The area is brightly illuminated by professional video equipment, including a large, three-panel studio light on the right, a horizontal light bar in the background, and a camera on a tripod to the left. A keyboard is positioned in the lower-middle section of the setup.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows two people in a video studio. At first, only the upper half of the person on the left and the head of the woman in the middle are visible at the bottom of the frame. As the camera tilts down, their full bodies gradually come into view, forming a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects, foreground equipment, and the downward camera tilt, it could be more precise about the initial framing and the dynamics of the transition. The description of the man's \"upper half\" and the woman's \"head\" seems inconsistent; it's more likely a medium shot framing both subjects from the chest up, with the man positioned on the left and the woman slightly more central. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the subjects' orientation—for instance, they might be angled slightly toward each other over the keyboard, creating a compositional V-shape that directs focus inward. Furthermore, during the downward tilt, the description should note that as the lower halves of their bodies and chairs are revealed, the tent ceiling and high light bar in the background simultaneously exit the top of the frame. Finally, classifying the concluding shot as a \"full shot\" is slightly inaccurate for seated subjects; \"medium long shot\" would better describe a frame that captures them from head to shin.",
