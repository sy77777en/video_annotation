    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a blurry, dark circular shape in the center of the frame, which rapidly sharpens into a static extreme close-up of a human eye. The eye is positioned in the center of the frame and occupies the foreground. The yellowish-brown iris and large, black pupil are the central elements, with the surrounding skin and eyelashes framing the eye from the top and bottom, also in the foreground. A white reflection is visible on the upper portion of the eye, and a small red light reflection is located to the right of the pupil. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up view reveals a human eye with a light, yellowish-brown iris and a large, black, dilated pupil. The surrounding skin has a light tone with a reddish tint. Upper and lower eyelashes are visible. A small, bright red dot of light and a larger white reflection are visible on the surface of the eye.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins as a dark, blurry, circular shape that sharpens into an extreme close-up of a human eye. The eye has a yellow-green iris and a large, black pupil that fills the center of the view. A small, distinct point of red light and a white reflective patch are visible on the surface of the iris. The surrounding skin has a reddish tone, and both upper and lower eyelashes are visible in the dimly lit environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the shot size and the central subject, but it oversimplifies the spatial dynamics and misses key details about depth. While it mentions the shot becomes \"static,\" the video actually shows subtle, continuous movement: the pupil slowly constricts after the initial focus pull, and the white reflection of a window pane subtly shifts on the convex surface of the cornea, indicating the subject is breathing or making micro-movements. This places the reflection on a spatial plane in front of the iris, a layer of depth the caption fails to distinguish. The description of the iris as just \"yellowish-brown\" is also incomplete; the extreme close-up reveals intricate, fibrous filaments radiating from the pupil, creating a sense of texture and internal depth within the eye itself. Additionally, the framing is more specific than described, with the upper eyelid and lashes occupying the top quarter of the frame and the lower waterline visible as a thin line along the bottom edge, rather than just being at the \"top and bottom.\"",
