    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a large industrial ship, which occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground. In the foreground, scaffolding is positioned on the left, extending towards the center along the ship's hull. The ship's superstructure, including two crane towers, is located in the middle ground. A faint, large structure is visible in the background, obscured by fog. Text is overlaid on the scene, with \"$350 MILLION\" in the bottom left corner and \"The actual ship looked a bit different\" in the top right corner. The camera is positioned at the ship's level. During the shot, the text in the bottom left corner disappears, while the rest of the frame remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, white industrial ship is depicted in a foggy, blue-green tinted environment. The vessel has a multi-level superstructure with two prominent, lattice-style crane towers on its top deck. Red pipes with ten-sided tops are visible on its various levels, along with two triangular supports on a lower deck. The support on the left has a yellow object attached to it. Scaffolding is erected along the side of the ship's hull. White text is overlaid on the scene; in the bottom left corner, it reads \"$350 MILLION\" with \"($1.5 BILLION IN TODAY'S MONEY)\" underneath, which disappears later in the video. In the top right corner, it says \"The actual ship looked a bit different.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows a large, white industrial ship docked in a hazy, misty environment, possibly a shipyard or dry dock. The vessel has a blocky superstructure, multiple decks, and two prominent crane towers. Several red pipes with ten-sided tops are visible on various levels of the ship, along with two triangular supports on a lower deck. The support on the left has a yellow object attached to it. Black metal scaffolding is constructed along the side of the ship. The scene is cast in a moderate blue-green light, with thick fog obscuring the background, where the faint outline of a large structure is visible. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"$350 MILLION\" with \"($1.5 BILLION IN TODAY'S MONEY)\" below it in white serif font. These overlays disappear in the latter half of the video. In the top right corner, another white text overlay reads, \"The actual ship looked a bit different.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The use of \"medium shot\" feels incorrect for a subject of this scale; a \"wide shot\" would better describe how the massive ship dominates the entire frame. The caption's description of the scaffolding \"shifting\" is vague; the video actually shows a time-lapse effect where the scaffolding structure is rapidly dismantled from the center and reassembled on the far-left side of the hull, which is a crucial dynamic detail. The caption also completely omits a very slow, subtle camera pan from left to right along the ship's length, a movement that emphasizes the vessel's immense size. While the text overlays are mentioned, their dynamics are not fully captured: the text in the bottom left corner doesn't just disappear, it fades out smoothly, and the text in the top right corner fades in at the same moment, creating a direct informational transition. Finally, the description could be more precise about the ship's orientation; the bow is positioned in the left foreground, angling away from the camera, with the stern receding into the right middle ground.",
