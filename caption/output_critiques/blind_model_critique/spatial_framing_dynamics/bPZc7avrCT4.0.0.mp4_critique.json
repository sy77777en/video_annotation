    "pre_caption": "This wide shot begins with a man standing in the middle ground, slightly left of center, on a football field, with large, empty stadium stands filling the background. He runs from his starting position toward the right foreground. As he moves, the camera pans slightly to the right, revealing a second man kneeling in the right middle ground, positioned next to a camera on a tripod. The first man continues to the right foreground, where he kicks a small purple balloon on the ground. After the kick, the first man is in the center of the frame, moving into the middle ground, while the second man and his camera remain in the right middle ground. The remnants of the kicked object are in the right foreground, and the stadium stands remain in the background throughout the scene. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man wearing a dark grey long-sleeved shirt, light grey shorts, red socks, white sneakers, and a dark backward-facing baseball cap is on a football field. He runs toward and kicks a small purple balloon filled with clear water, which bursts and creates a splash that appears white upon impact. Kneeling nearby on the grass is another light-skinned man filming the action. This second man wears a blue t-shirt with \"AUBURN\" and additional text that is not clearly visible, dark shorts, and a red backward-facing baseball cap. He holds a smartphone and is positioned next to a professional camera on a black tripod. A brown American football lies on the grass near the man who is filming. The purple balloon is placed on the ground and connected to a structure made of three sticks that stands on the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on the green grass of a football field inside a large, empty stadium on a sunny day. The multi-tiered grey stands encircle the field, which is marked with white yard lines. In the distance, a scoreboard is visible. On the field, a small purple ball sits on a tee before being kicked, causing it to explode in a splash of liquid. A camera on a tripod is positioned nearby, along with a brown football resting on the grass.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the initial wide shot and the subjects' general movements, it fails to describe the corresponding change in shot size as the camera advances, which would logically tighten the frame to a medium-long or medium shot by the conclusion. The term \"revealed\" for the second man is ambiguous; a more precise description would state that the camera's pan to the right brings him into the frame from off-screen. The spatial relationship during the kick is also unclear, as it doesn't specify if the first man runs from a foreground position to kick the balloon in the midground or if he has already entered the midground himself. Additionally, the description of the kicked object's remnants is somewhat passive; it could be more dynamic by stating that the sticks fly directly toward the camera and exit the frame at the bottom, which would better capture the action. Lastly, the final position of the second man in the \"right foreground\" could be more specific, for instance, the \"far-right foreground,\" to provide a clearer picture of the final composition.",
