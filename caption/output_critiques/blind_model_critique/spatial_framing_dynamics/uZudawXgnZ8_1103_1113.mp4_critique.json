    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot is captured from a high-angle, top-down perspective. A character is positioned in the center-right of the frame, within a large dirt patch that occupies the middle ground. The scene is populated with various trees: green deciduous and pine trees are scattered across the left, center, and bottom of the frame, while a distinct purple-blossomed tree stands in the right middle ground. The top edge of the frame shows a portion of a wooden building in the background. The character chops a tree located directly in front of them in the center-right middle ground, causing it to fall to the left and disappear, leaving a stump in its place. Throughout the video, a toolbar remains fixed at the bottom of the frame, a game status display is in the top right, and an overlay is in the bottom right. Following the tree's fall, a temporary inventory counter appears in the bottom left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel-art video game scene, a character with light skin and gray hair, wearing a red shirt and blue pants, is shown chopping down a green-leafed tree with an axe. The tree eventually falls, leaving a stump, and the character collects wood and sap. The surrounding area is filled with other trees, including dark green pine trees and more green-leafed deciduous trees. To the right and bottom right, two visually distinct trees with full canopies of bright purple blossoms stand out among the greenery. The ground is a mix of dirt and grass, cluttered with gray rocks, small logs, and patches of weeds. A user interface is present, featuring a toolbar with various tools at the bottom, a display in the top-right corner showing the in-game date, time, and currency, an overlay in the bottom right, and some temporary overlays in the bottom left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows an outdoor, rural scene. The environment consists of green grass and a large, cleared patch of light brown dirt, cluttered with small rocks, logs, and patches of weeds. Various types of trees, including dark green pines and lighter green deciduous trees, are scattered throughout the area, with two prominent trees featuring bright pink blossoms, one on the right and another on the bottom right. The bottom edge of a wooden building is visible at the upper boundary of the scene, but only in the first part of the video. A character is actively chopping down a green tree with an axe, causing it to fall and leave a stump. Overlays are present on the screen: in the top right corner, a heads-up display shows the date as \"Mon. 1,\" the time as around 9:30 am, and a currency count of 500. At the bottom, a toolbar displays icons for various tools, and in the bottom left, an inventory counter for wood and sap is temporarily visible. Additionally, there is an overlay with the letter \"E\" in the bottom right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main character, action, and key environmental elements, it could be more precise in its spatial analysis and dynamic descriptions. The term \"extreme wide shot\" may be an overstatement; \"wide shot\" would be more appropriate if the character, while small, is still a clear focal point. The description of the camera movement is vague; specifying the direction and timing of the \"shift\"—for example, \"after the tree falls, the camera pans slightly down and to the left, following the character as they take a step\"—would provide a clearer understanding of the dynamics. Furthermore, the caption could better integrate the 3D positions; while it uses 2D locators like \"left\" and \"right,\" it should consistently clarify that the character, trees, and building all exist in the middle ground, with the UI elements occupying the fixed foreground. Finally, the description of the temporary inventory counter could be more connected to the action, for instance, by noting that it appears as the character approaches the tree and disappears once the wood is collected, linking the UI element directly to the in-game event.",
