    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a sleeping tiger in the middle ground. The tiger's head is positioned in the center-right of the frame, with its body extending toward the left. One of its paws is prominently displayed in the center-left foreground, near its face. The tiger rests on a wooden platform that spans the bottom of the frame. In the background, a stone wall is visible. The camera is positioned at the tiger's level in a static shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A tiger is shown in a close-up view, lying down and resting. Its head is turned to the side with its eyes closed. The tiger's fur is a vibrant orange with distinct black stripes, contrasted by white fur on its chin, cheeks, and the area around its eyes. Long white whiskers extend from its snout. One of its large front paws is placed near its face, displaying its black pads and a pinkish spot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A tiger is shown sleeping on a wooden platform. The background consists of a gray and light brown, unevenly textured stone wall. The tiger lies on its side, with its head and one of its large paws in view, displaying its black and pink pads, while another paw is partially visible in profile.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subject and its general position, it could be more precise about the shot size and depth. The term \"close-up\" might be misleading; if a significant portion of the tiger's upper torso is visible as its body extends left, \"medium close-up\" would be a more accurate description. The caption fails to mention the shallow depth of field, which is a critical element of the framing; the background stone wall is likely out of focus, a detail that should be included to better describe the visual emphasis on the tiger. Furthermore, the description of the wooden platform not reaching the bottom right is incomplete; it should specify what fills that space, such as some green foliage and dirt visible in the middle ground in that corner. Lastly, the description of a \"sleeping\" tiger in a \"static shot\" misses the subtle dynamics; the video likely shows the gentle rise and fall of the tiger's flank as it breathes and perhaps a slight twitch of its ear, which are minor but important movements within the otherwise still frame.",
