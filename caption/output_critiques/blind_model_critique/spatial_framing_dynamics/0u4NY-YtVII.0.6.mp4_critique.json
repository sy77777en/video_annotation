    "pre_caption": "The scene is composed of three separate medium shots, digitally combined to appear as a single panel. A woman occupies the center of the frame, with one man positioned to her left and another to her right, each filling roughly one-third of the screen. All three subjects are situated in the middle ground of their respective shots, with distinct studio backgrounds behind them. In the foreground, a large red graphic banner spans the bottom of the screen, featuring text elements across its length. Just above this banner, a smaller text overlay is positioned in the bottom-left quadrant. The camera maintains a static position throughout, filming all three subjects at their eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a medium shot, three separate images of individuals are combined to create the appearance of a television studio setting. In the center of the composition is a woman with light skin and long, straight brown hair, wearing a white jacket over a black top, and she has a serious expression as she looks forward. On the left side of the frame is a man with light skin, short, dark, receding hair, and a clean-shaven face. He is dressed in a beige suit jacket and a white shirt, looking forward with several papers in his right hand. On the right side of the frame is another man with light skin, short dark hair, and a full dark beard and mustache. He wears a dark blue suit, a white shirt, and a dark blue tie, sitting with his hands clasped and a serious expression on his face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a broadcast-style viewpoint typical of television production, capturing an indoor studio setting. The background predominantly features red and black colors, accented by white light strips and some blue lettering. The images of three individuals have been digitally combined, with a man in a tan jacket on the left, a woman in a white jacket in the center, and a man in a blue suit on the right. A prominent red overlay banner is positioned at the bottom of the screen, displaying the white text 'ÇİFTLİK BANK TARTIŞMASI' in the center, 'TELEFON' on the left, 'GECE GÖRÜŞÜ' to the right of the center, and the 'CNN TÜRK' logo on the far right. Just above the banner on the left side, another overlay shows the text 'MEHMET ÇEVİK - TİYATROCU' in white, next to a small CNN logo.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: It's a TV program, showing a woman in the center with two men on either side. Each person is shown in a separate medium shot, occupying one-third of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It's a TV program , showing a woman in the center with two men on either side. Each person is shown in a separate medium shot, occupying one-third of the frame. They are filmed with different cameras and backgrounds. All three are filmed at their level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the three-panel structure and the presence of a zoom, it lacks specificity regarding the spatial dynamics and framing transitions. The description of the initial \"medium shots\" is vague; it would be more informative to state how much of each subject is visible, such as from the waist up. Crucially, the caption fails to describe the final shot size after the zoom, leaving the most significant spatial change incomplete—for instance, it could specify that the zoom transitions the framing from a medium shot to a medium close-up, showing the subjects from the chest up. The positioning of the men \"to her left\" and \"to her right\" is ambiguous and could be clarified by stating they occupy the left and right thirds of the frame, respectively. Additionally, the description of the graphic elements could be more precise; for example, the text on the red banner might be identifiable as the subjects' names and titles, and the position of the '[2]' overlay could be clarified as being just above the banner rather than simply in the corner. The description of the backgrounds as \"distinct studio backgrounds\" is also too general, as the video might show specific details like a blurred cityscape for one and a branded wall for another, which are key spatial elements.",
