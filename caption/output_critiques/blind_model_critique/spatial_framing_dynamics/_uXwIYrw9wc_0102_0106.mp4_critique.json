    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center foreground, with a tall object featuring purple lights visible in the left middle ground against a dark background. While the man's head and torso remain stationary, his hands move dynamically within the frame. Initially, his right hand is near the right side of his face, then it moves across his face before both hands are raised to either side of his head, framing it. The camera remains static and is positioned at the man's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with bright blue eyes and a trimmed brown beard and mustache is shown from the chest up. His hair is styled in a high top knot, and he wears a black and grey patterned bandana on his forehead, a black long-sleeved shirt, and a silver-colored chain necklace. He has a small stud earring in each ear. Tattoos are visible on his hands and wrists; his left wrist features a leopard print pattern, and the back of each hand has a small, dark tattoo. He wears both a beaded bracelet and a silver bracelet on his right wrist. He looks directly at the camera, gesturing with his hands near his face as he speaks or raps.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space, likely at night, against a dark and indistinct background. To the left, a tall, dark, vertical object, possibly a computer tower, is visible with glowing purple lights. A man with a beard, wearing a bandana and a necklace, is centrally positioned in the foreground, illuminated by a direct light source as he gestures with his hands. The overall color palette is dark, with the purple glow providing a subtle accent.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation, but could be more precise in its spatial description. The term 'close-up' might be inaccurate; if the man's torso is visible as implied, 'medium close-up' would be more appropriate. The 'tall object' could be described with more visual detail, such as 'a vertical column of purple lights,' to be more informative without speculating on its function. A crucial missing element is depth of field; the caption should specify if the man is in sharp focus against a softly focused middle ground and background, as this is key to conveying spatial depth. The phrase 'as part of his performance' is an interpretation of intent and could be removed for greater objectivity. Finally, while the hand movement is well-described on a 2D plane, adding details about their movement towards or away from the camera would create a more complete 3D picture. Mentioning if the purple light casts a reflection or rim light on the man would also better connect the elements within the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center foreground, with a vertical column of purple lights visible in the left middle ground against a dark background. The man is in sharp focus, while the middle ground and background are softly focused, enhancing the spatial depth. His head and torso remain stationary, but his hands move dynamically within the frame. Initially, his right hand is near the right side of his face, then it moves across his face before both hands are raised to either side of his head, framing it. The hands also move slightly towards and away from the camera, adding a 3D dimension to the movement. The purple light casts a subtle reflection or rim light on the man, connecting the elements within the scene. The camera remains static and is positioned at the man's level.",
