    "pre_caption": "In a static medium shot, a golden figure is positioned in the center-foreground, viewed from behind. This figure is seated at a large wooden desk that occupies the middle ground of the scene. On the desk, a lit lamp is on the left, a rotary phone is in the bottom-left, a typewriter is on the right, and a model train is in the center. A green book is in the bottom-left and a brown book is in the bottom-right. In the background, three silver figures stand in a row across the upper-center of the frame, behind the desk. The camera is positioned above the subjects, looking down at the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A metallic, golden-hued figure of a man is shown from behind, seated at a large wooden desk. The figure is wearing what appears to be a metallic trench coat. Facing this seated figure, on the opposite side of the desk, stand three other metallic, humanoid figures. These three standing figures are silver-colored, have smooth, featureless faces, and are arranged in a row. The desk between them holds several objects: a lit desk lamp casting a bright glare, a black rotary telephone, a vintage typewriter, a model of a red and white train car, and two small books, one green and one brown. The entire scene is dark, illuminated only by the single, bright desk lamp.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, indoor setting, a metallic, golden-hued figure is seated at a large wooden desk, seen from behind. The desk is furnished with a vintage typewriter, a black rotary telephone, a model of a red and white train car, and two small books. A single desk lamp illuminates the scene, casting a bright spotlight and a horizontal lens flare across the otherwise dark room. Facing the seated figure from the other side of the desk are three standing, featureless figures with a silver, metallic finish. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text \"(CC-BY 4.0)\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's use of \"medium shot\" feels inaccurate, as the frame seems wider, encompassing a seated figure, a large desk, and three background figures, making it closer to a medium-long shot. The spatial description of items on the desk is confusing; labeling the rotary phone and green book as \"bottom-left\" and the brown book as \"bottom-right\" ambiguously mixes their 2D frame position with their 3D middle-ground location on the desk, creating a false impression that they might be in the foreground. A more precise description would place them on the left and right sides of the desk's surface within the middle ground. Most importantly, while the caption correctly identifies the clockwise arcing camera movement, it completely omits the dynamic effect of this motion on the composition. It fails to describe how the 2D positions of the desk items and background figures shift within the frame as the camera moves—for instance, the typewriter on the right would appear to travel toward the bottom of the frame, and the lamp on the left would move toward the top. Additionally, the caption neglects to mention that the model train is actively moving in a circle on its tracks in the center of the desk, a key spatial dynamic within the scene.",

A model train actively moves in a circle on its tracks in the center of the desk. In the background, three silver figures stand in a row across the upper-center of the frame, behind the desk. The camera, positioned above the subjects, moves in a clockwise arc, causing the typewriter to appear to travel toward the bottom of the frame and the lamp to move toward the top, dynamically shifting the 2D positions of the desk items and background figures within the frame.",
