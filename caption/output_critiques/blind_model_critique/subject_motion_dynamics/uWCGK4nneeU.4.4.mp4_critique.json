    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A large, modified aircraft is shown in flight, initially from a low-angle perspective and then from a level-angle perspective. The plane has a white fuselage with a red top and a red vertical section on its T-shaped tail. It features long, straight wings with numerous small, white, spinning propellers along the underside of each wing. The aircraft's landing gear is extended, showing multiple wheels. The most prominent feature is a massive, bulbous, light-colored structure attached to the rear of the fuselage, encased in a dark, cage-like framework of wires or rods. This structure is significantly wider than the plane's main body and tapers towards the back.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the aircraft's key features, such as the spinning propellers, and correctly notes the change in camera perspective. However, the description of the motion could be more precise and chronologically integrated. The term \"transitions\" is ambiguous; it should specify if this is a hard cut between two separate shots (e.g., one from the ground, one from a chase plane) or a continuous camera movement. The phrase \"flies forward\" is redundant and could be replaced by a more descriptive action tied to each segment, such as \"passes directly overhead\" in the first shot and \"cruises at a level altitude\" in the second. Furthermore, the caption doesn't clarify when the mist appears. A better description would specify that after the cut to the level angle, the aircraft begins emitting a trail of mist from its tail, linking this action chronologically to the second part of the video. This would provide a clearer sequence of events: the initial flyover, the cut, and then the subsequent action of releasing the mist during its steady flight.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A large, modified aircraft with numerous small propellers spinning beneath its wings passes directly overhead, captured from a low-angle perspective. The camera then transitions smoothly to track the plane from a side view, showing it cruising at a level altitude. As the aircraft continues its steady flight, it begins emitting a trail of mist from its tail, adding a dynamic element to the scene.",
