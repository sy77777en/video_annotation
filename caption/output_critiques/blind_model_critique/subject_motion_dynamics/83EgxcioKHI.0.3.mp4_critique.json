    "pre_caption": "A person in a red puffy coat runs away from the camera, their body swaying as they move across the muddy, uneven ground. To their left and slightly ahead, another person in a long, dark coat also moves forward. To the right of the main subject, a third individual pushes a wheelchair, moving in the same direction as the group. All individuals are proceeding forward through a desolate, debris-strewn area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject is a person seen from behind, running away from the camera. They are wearing a bright red, puffy, long-sleeved coat over a dark, long dress. They are running with two other individuals in a desolate, muddy area. To the left and slightly ahead of the main subject, a person in a long, dark coat walks or runs forward. To the right and in front of the main subject, another person in a dark overcoat is pushing a wheelchair with someone seated in it, also moving in the same direction. Between the figures, in the midground, is a dark, wrecked car with a smashed front end and a caved-in hood.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively establishes the chronological order of movement and identifies the key individuals, but it could be more precise about the nature of the motion. The term \"runs\" for the main subject might be an overstatement; the video shows all individuals moving at a similar, hurried pace, better described as \"scrambling\" or \"trudging\" to convey their struggle against the muddy ground. The description of the wheelchair's movement is vague; the video shows the pusher deliberately slowing down, allowing the person in red to move past them on the left, before they cut behind and reappear on the right side, a specific maneuver that highlights the group's coordinated effort. Additionally, the caption omits the non-verbal interactions visible in the video, such as the person in red periodically glancing back at the others and the person in the dark coat gesturing forward, which confirms they are a cohesive unit. Finally, the person seated in the wheelchair is not entirely passive; they are shown bracing themselves with their hands on the armrests as the chair jostles over the debris.",
