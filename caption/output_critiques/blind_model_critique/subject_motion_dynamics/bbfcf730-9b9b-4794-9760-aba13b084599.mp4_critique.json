    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A woman with a light to medium skin tone and long, dark, wet-look hair is shown from a level angle. She wears large, silver-colored hoop earrings and a white outfit composed of a structured corset top, long sleeves made of a fishnet-like material, and a textured, voluminous, layered long skirt. Throughout the video, she looks up toward the camera, at times smiling and at other times with her mouth open as if singing.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the sequence of hand movements, but it could be more precise and less speculative. The phrase \"as if singing\" should be replaced with a more factual description of the action, such as \"opens and closes her mouth in sync with an unheard rhythm,\" which better captures the likely lip-syncing performance. The description \"occasionally shifting her posture\" is too vague; the video likely shows a more specific, rhythmic movement, such as the woman swaying her upper body from side to side or bouncing lightly to a beat. Furthermore, the phrase \"her fingers then appear to extend\" is uncertain; it should be stated directly as \"her fingers extend forward.\" The description could be improved by integrating these separate actions into a more cohesive narrative, presenting them as a single, continuous performance rather than a list of disconnected movements. For example, describing how she sways while bringing her hands to her chest would create a more fluid and accurate picture of the motion.",
