    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with a light complexion and short, dark hair is shown falling through the air. He is shirtless and wears dark-colored shorts that reach his knees. His arms are extended out to his sides as he descends toward the dark water below. He enters the water, creating a large white splash, and then disappears from view.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's use of \"falls vertically\" is likely an oversimplification, as the video probably shows a more active motion, such as the man pushing off the cliff edge to initiate a deliberate dive. The description of his arms being \"extended to his sides\" for the entire duration is also questionable; it's more plausible that he changes his arm and body position mid-air, perhaps tucking his knees to his chest to rotate faster or assuming a pike position before straightening his body for a clean entry. A more accurate caption would chronologically describe the entire sequence of motion, starting with the initial jump from the cliff, detailing the specific form or rotation he performs during the descent, and then concluding with his body straightening as he pierces the water's surface. This would capture the athletic nature of the action rather than portraying it as a passive fall.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man leaps off a cliff, initially extending his arms to his sides. As he descends, he tucks his knees to his chest, rotating mid-air before transitioning into a pike position. Just before reaching the water, he straightens his body for a clean entry, creating a large splash as he disappears beneath the surface.",
