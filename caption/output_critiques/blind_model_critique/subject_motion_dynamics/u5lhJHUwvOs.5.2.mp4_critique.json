    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with short, light-colored hair, seen from behind, stands in the foreground wearing a black sleeveless shirt. He is silhouetted as he raises his hands toward his ears. Through a glass door in front of him, another man with dark hair is visible inside a squash court. This second man, wearing a grey t-shirt and dark shorts, is actively playing squash, holding a racquet with a green frame.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the two main subjects and their general actions, but it lacks chronological precision and specificity. The actions are presented as simultaneous rather than a potential cause-and-effect sequence; it's more likely the man in the background hits the ball, and the man in the foreground reacts to the loud sound. The description of the squash player's motion, \"swings a racquet from left to right as he plays,\" is too generic. A more accurate description would detail the specific stroke, such as a forehand or backhand, and mention the player lunging or rotating to strike the ball. Crucially, the caption omits the ball's movement entirely—its impact against the wall and subsequent rebound are the central actions of the game. Furthermore, since squash is a two-player game, the caption should account for the presence and motion of the opponent, if visible. A better caption would first describe the player hitting the ball against the wall, and then describe the foreground man's reaction of covering his ears in response to the impact.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In the background, a man inside a squash court lunges forward and executes a powerful forehand stroke, sending the ball crashing against the wall with a loud thud. As the ball rebounds, the man in the foreground, seen from behind, raises his hands to cover his ears in response to the noise. The presence of an opponent on the court, poised to return the ball, adds to the dynamic scene.",
