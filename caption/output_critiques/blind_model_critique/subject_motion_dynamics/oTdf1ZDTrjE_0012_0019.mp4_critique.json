    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with a medium skin tone stands facing the camera. He is wearing a bright yellow short-sleeved T-shirt, dark-colored pants, a brown fedora-style hat, and sunglasses. He holds a black drone controller with a screen in both hands at chest level. To the left, a black camera is mounted on a tall, black tripod with its legs extended. A smaller black rectangular device is attached to one of the tripod's legs, connected to the camera by a cable with a reflective texture that appears to be a light color.**",

  "generated_critique": "Your feedback is as follows: The caption accurately notes the man's static posture but completely omits what is likely the video's primary subject of motion: the drone. By focusing only on the stationary operator, the description fails to capture the essence of the action. I imagine the video shows the drone taking off near the man, ascending into the sky, and then flying out over the mountain landscape. The caption should chronologically describe the drone's flight path—for instance, detailing its initial ascent, its maneuvers such as circling the peak or panning across a valley, and its eventual return. Furthermore, describing the man as completely \"still\" is likely an oversimplification; a more accurate caption would mention the subtle but crucial movements of his thumbs on the controller's joysticks and his head and eyes turning to track the drone's flight, thereby connecting his actions to the drone's movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The man stands on a mountaintop, holding a drone controller in front of him. As the video begins, the drone takes off near him, ascending into the sky. The man subtly moves his thumbs on the controller's joysticks and turns his head and eyes to follow the drone's flight. The drone gracefully circles the peak, offering sweeping views of the mountain landscape, before panning across a vast valley. After showcasing the breathtaking scenery, the drone returns to the man, completing its journey.",
