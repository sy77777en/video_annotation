    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A large, four-engine passenger jet, resembling a Boeing 747 with its distinctive upper-deck hump, is shown from a high angle in front of the plane, facing backward towards the aircraft as it flies above a thick layer of clouds. The entire aircraft has a silver metallic color, with the front appearing prominently blue due to reflections. The bottom of the front and the rest of the body are white. The wings are a silver-gray color, with two jet engines mounted under each one. The top surfaces of the plane are illuminated by a warm, golden light, contrasting with the shadowed clouds below.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the camera perspective is contradictory, stating it is both \"rear-facing\" and \"positioned in front of the plane, facing backward,\" which creates confusion. A clearer approach would be to simply state that the camera faces the front of the aircraft as it flies away from the lens. The description of the motion as \"flies steadily forward, maintaining a straight and level course\" is accurate but overly generic and slightly redundant. To be more descriptive, you could incorporate more specific visual details that are likely present in such a video. For example, you could mention the long, white contrails streaming from the four engines, which visually demonstrates the plane's powerful forward thrust and interaction with the atmosphere. Additionally, you could describe the subtle, rhythmic flexing of the wings as they handle aerodynamic forces, adding a layer of detail to the \"steady\" flight. Including these specific actions would provide a more vivid and complete picture of the aircraft's motion, moving beyond a general statement of its trajectory.",
