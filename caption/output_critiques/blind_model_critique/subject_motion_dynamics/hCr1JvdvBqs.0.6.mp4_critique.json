    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A light-skinned, middle-aged man with shoulder-length, wavy dark brown hair, a dark brown mustache, and a goatee is shown in a close-up. He is wearing a dark brown jacket over a dark collared shirt. He is seated and facing slightly to his left, looking at another person who is mostly off-screen. Initially, he has a neutral expression and looks slightly downward, then he looks up and opens his mouth as if to speak. To the left, the back of another person's head and shoulder are visible; this person has light brown hair.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly presents the man's actions in chronological order, it could be more precise and descriptive. The phrase 'initially shifts his gaze toward the person' is ambiguous; if the video starts with him already looking at the person, it would be clearer to state that he first breaks eye contact. The description 'looks downward' is generic and could be improved by specifying if he lowers only his eyes or tilts his entire head, as the latter implies a more contemplative action. Similarly, 'returning his focus' is an abstract interpretation; a more concrete description of the physical movement, such as 'raises his head to look back at the person,' would be better. The caption also overlooks other potential motions that might accompany his gaze shifts, such as a slight nod while looking down or a change in his posture or facial expression just before he opens his mouth, which would add valuable detail to the description of his movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The man, initially breaking eye contact, tilts his head downward in a contemplative manner. He then raises his head to look back at the person off-screen, accompanied by a slight nod. Just before he opens his mouth to speak, there is a subtle change in his posture and facial expression, indicating his readiness to engage.",
