    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In this black-and-white video, a person in a dark, form-fitting, half-body wetsuit is shown jumping barefoot. The person is captured in mid-air, arched forward with their hands near their hips, as they descend feet-first. The perspective then shifts to an underwater view, where the person's entire body, including the arms, is seen entering the water, surrounded by a splash and bubbles.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the chronological sequence of events and the shift in camera perspective, but it lacks specificity regarding the subject's actions and the environment. The term \"descends\" is passive; a more active verb like \"jumps\" or \"leaps\" would better describe the initial motion. The caption also omits the starting point of the action—for instance, whether the person is jumping from a rocky cliff, a bridge, or a boat, which would be a key visual element. Furthermore, the description of the water entry could be more dynamic; an underwater shot would likely show the feet piercing the surface, creating a large plume of bubbles and turbulence, which is a significant part of the motion. Finally, the description ends abruptly once the person is submerged. The video likely continues to show the person's subsequent movements, such as kicking their legs to swim deeper, arching their back to resurface, or simply drifting downwards, and including this final phase of motion would make the description more complete.",
