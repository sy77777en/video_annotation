    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with an underwater view of a seabed covered in multicolored rocks and pebbles in shades of green, gray, and brown. The perspective then rises to break the surface of the clear water, revealing a rocky beach with several people. A young boy with light skin, wearing a black cap and blue swim trunks, sits at the water's edge. To the left, a young girl with light skin stands on the rocks, wearing a two-piece swimsuit with purple patterned bottoms. Further to the left, another young girl with brown skin and dark hair stands in a white one-piece swimsuit. Near them, a man with a darker complexion sits wearing a white shirt. In the midground, other beachgoers are visible, including a man in blue shorts walking near the water.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the initial camera movement from underwater to the surface and identifies the various subjects, it lacks specificity in describing their actions. The description of the main subject, \"a man in blue shorts walks along the shoreline,\" is too generic; it should specify his direction of movement, such as walking from left to right across the frame, and his interaction with the water, for example, if waves are lapping at his ankles. Similarly, stating that others are \"swimming in the water\" is vague; it would be more informative to describe their specific actions, such as treading water in the distance or swimming parallel to the shore. The description of the stationary people could also be improved by noting their positions relative to each other and the camera, for instance, clarifying that the boy sits on a large rock in the foreground while the two girls stand beside him looking out at the water. Finally, the caption separates the groups of people in a slightly disjointed manner, which could be integrated more smoothly to create a more cohesive and vivid description of the overall beach scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera starts with an underwater view of a rocky seabed, then rises to break the surface of the rippling water. As the perspective shifts, a rocky beach comes into view, where a man in blue shorts walks from left to right along the shoreline, with waves gently lapping at his ankles. In the foreground, a boy sits on a large rock, while two girls stand beside him, gazing out at the water. In the distance, other people can be seen treading water and swimming parallel to the shore, creating a lively and interconnected beach scene.",
