  "generated_critique": "Your caption correctly identifies the primary camera movement as a counterclockwise arc around the house. However, it dedicates too much space to describing static architectural features like the garage and porch, which violates the instruction to focus on motion. The description of the motion itself is also too general. For instance, you could specify the extent of the arc—does the camera complete a full 360-degree rotation, or does it only pan across the front and one side of the house? Furthermore, the statement \"The scene remains consistent\" is a missed opportunity. In my imagined version of this 3D animation, there are subtle secondary movements to make the scene feel alive, such as smoke gently curling from the chimney or the leaves on the trees in the yard swaying slightly in a digital breeze. A better caption would state that the house itself is stationary and then describe the camera's specific path in more detail, while also chronologically incorporating any subtle environmental animations present in the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video features a dynamic, high-angle shot of a 3D animated suburban house. The camera moves in a counterclockwise arc, starting from the front of the house and sweeping around to reveal one side, covering approximately 180 degrees. While the house itself remains stationary, the scene is brought to life with subtle animations: smoke gently curls from the chimney, and the leaves on the trees sway slightly in a digital breeze, adding a sense of movement and realism to the environment.",
