    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A bird's-eye angle shot filmed at aerial level captures a dark gray asphalt road forming a large, smooth U-shaped curve over a winter landscape. The ground is covered in white snow, with numerous dark, bare trees and shrubs scattered beneath the elevated roadway. A small, black car is visible on the left side of the curved road. A narrow, dark river flows through the center of the scene, passing under the road, and is crossed by a small, straight structure that appears to be a weir, covered in snow, giving it a white appearance.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject and its general path, but it could be more precise and less redundant. The phrase \"From a bird's-eye angle shot filmed at aerial level\" is repetitive; \"From an aerial view\" would be more concise. The description of the motion, \"drives along... moving steadily,\" is somewhat generic. For instance, the video might show the car moving cautiously, perhaps slowing slightly as it enters the tightest part of the curve before accelerating gently as the road straightens. The caption also misses the interaction between the car and its environment; it could mention if the car is kicking up loose snow from the road's surface or leaving distinct tire tracks in a thin layer of snow on the pavement. Finally, clarifying the full trajectory, such as stating that the car enters from the left and continues along the bend until it exits the frame on the right, would provide a more complete description of the action.",
