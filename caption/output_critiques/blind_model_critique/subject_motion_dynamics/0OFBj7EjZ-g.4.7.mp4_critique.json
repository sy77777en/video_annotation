    "pre_caption": "The video, playing in reverse, shows two long, thin, transparent rectangular pieces appearing on the right. Simultaneously, numerous small, sharp-edged transparent shards fly inward from off-screen. These shards converge around a central turquoise column, reassembling themselves to form a complete, unbroken transparent cylindrical shell that connects the top and bottom circular platforms.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video, presented in reverse, begins with a clear scene devoid of fragments. Gradually, numerous small, sharp-edged transparent shards move into the frame, reassembling themselves onto the exterior of a transparent cylindrical shell that encases a glowing turquoise column. This column connects a wide, light-gray circular base and a matching circular top. Two long, thin, vertically oriented rectangular pieces, made of the same transparent material, appear to the right of the central structure.**",

  "generated_critique": "Your feedback is as follows:\n\nThe caption correctly identifies that the video plays in reverse and accurately describes the initial reassembly of the shards into a cylindrical shell. However, the description of the subsequent action is logically inconsistent with the reverse playback. The caption states that two rectangular pieces \"appear\" and \"are positioned,\" which describes a forward motion. If the entire video is in reverse, these pieces should be shown *un-positioning* themselves and *disappearing* from the frame—for instance, they might slide outward or fade away from their vertical placement. Furthermore, the \"top and bottom circular platforms\" are introduced abruptly at the end of the caption; these static elements should be mentioned at the beginning to properly establish the scene before any motion is described. A more accurate caption would first set the scene with the column and platforms, then describe the shards swirling inward to form the shell, and finally describe the two rectangular pieces sliding or moving away from their positions and exiting the frame, maintaining the reverse-motion logic throughout the entire description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video, playing in reverse, begins with a central turquoise column connecting two circular platforms at the top and bottom. Numerous small, sharp-edged transparent shards swirl inward from off-screen, converging to form a complete, unbroken transparent cylindrical shell around the column. As the video continues, two long, thin, transparent rectangular pieces slide outward from their positions on the right and disappear from the frame, maintaining the reverse-motion logic throughout.",
