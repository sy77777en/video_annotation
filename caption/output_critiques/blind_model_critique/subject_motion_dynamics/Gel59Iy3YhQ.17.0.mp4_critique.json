    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject is a small, pale-skinned humanoid figure, possibly a child, wearing dark shorts and a small, glowing yellow light on its chest. The figure is initially seen hanging from a thin, dark cable above a large, dark, web-like net. Several black, rectangular boxes are scattered across this net. The figure then detaches from the cable, creating a small puff of white vapor, and falls into the dark, murky space below. As it descends, several small, dark, fish-like shapes can be seen swimming in the gloom.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the chronological order of events, but it could be more precise in describing the changes in motion and the nature of the interactions. The initial state is described as the figure \"hangs,\" but the video shows it swaying gently from side to side, a subtle motion that is missed. The term \"large net\" is an interpretation; visually, it appears to be the surface of a dark liquid with a grid-like reflection, and describing it this way would better foreshadow the figure's submersion. The caption combines the fall and the descent, but the video clearly shows two distinct phases of motion: a rapid, free-fall through the air, followed by a much slower, controlled sinking after it smoothly breaks the surface of the liquid without a splash. Finally, \"swim around\" is too general for the fish-like shapes; the video shows them emerging from the murky depths below and swarming upward toward the sinking figure, with some darting in to nudge it before retreating back into the gloom.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A small humanoid figure gently sways from side to side, suspended by a thin cable above what appears to be the surface of a dark liquid with a grid-like reflection. The figure detaches from the cable, creating a small puff of vapor, and enters a rapid free-fall through the air. It then smoothly breaks the surface of the liquid without a splash, transitioning into a slower, controlled sinking. As it descends, several small, dark, fish-like shapes emerge from the murky depths below, swarming upward toward the figure. Some of these shapes dart in to nudge the figure before retreating back into the gloom.",
