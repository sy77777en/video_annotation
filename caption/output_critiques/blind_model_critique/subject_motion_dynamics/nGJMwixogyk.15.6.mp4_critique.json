    "pre_caption": "Several people walk up and down the wide stone steps in front of the large temple gate, while others stand or move slowly near the entrance and along the pathway. Some individuals ascend the stairs toward the temple, while a few descend or pause briefly on the steps. The overall motion consists of people moving at a relaxed pace in different directions, with no single subject dominating the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a decent overview but lacks specificity and fails to capture the more distinct, observable actions that give the scene its character. For example, the video clearly shows a small group, likely a family, stopping midway up the steps to take a photograph, with one person posing while another frames the shot. The description of people \"mov[ing] slowly near the entrance\" is too vague; it misses that these individuals are gathered around a large incense burner to the side of the path, using their hands to waft the smoke toward themselves in a ritualistic manner. Furthermore, the caption's claim of a uniform \"relaxed pace\" is inaccurate, as an elderly couple is shown ascending the stairs very slowly with the help of a handrail, while a young person in athletic wear quickly jogs down the same steps. Mentioning these specific interactions and contrasting movements would provide a much more faithful and detailed account of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Several people navigate the wide stone steps in front of the large temple gate, each engaged in distinct activities that add character to the scene. A small group, likely a family, pauses midway up the steps to take a photograph, with one person posing while another frames the shot. Near the entrance, individuals gather around a large incense burner to the side of the path, using their hands to waft the smoke toward themselves in a ritualistic manner. The pace of movement varies significantly: an elderly couple ascends the stairs very slowly with the help of a handrail, while a young person in athletic wear quickly jogs down the same steps. These specific interactions and contrasting movements create a dynamic and detailed portrayal of the scene.",
