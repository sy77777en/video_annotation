    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A light-skinned man, who appears to be in his 40s, is shown in a close-up shot. He has shoulder-length, wavy, dark brown hair, along with a dark brown goatee and mustache. He is wearing a rust-colored jacket over a brown-grey collared shirt. He is seated and facing directly forward, slightly to the left of the frame, looking at another person with an attentive expression. To the left, the rear side of a woman's head is visible, though she is out of focus. She has reddish-brown hair and is positioned opposite the man.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies that the man is speaking while seated in a moving vehicle, but it misses several key motions that provide more detail about the interaction. The description \"remains seated\" is too static; the man actually gestures with his right hand as he speaks and nods his head intermittently. Furthermore, the caption states he is \"looking toward a person,\" but it omits the initial action where he turns his head and upper body to the left to face the other person before he begins speaking. The description of the moving scenery is an inference, whereas a more direct observation of motion would be to note the slight, constant swaying of the man's body, consistent with the movement of the vehicle. Finally, while the other person's head is only partially visible, it does move in a subtle nodding motion, which is a crucial part of the non-verbal exchange and should be included.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The man sits in a moving vehicle, initially turning his head and upper body to the left to face a partially visible person. As he speaks, he gestures with his right hand and nods his head intermittently. His body sways slightly with the vehicle's motion. The other person's head, though only partially visible, nods subtly in response, adding to the non-verbal exchange.",
