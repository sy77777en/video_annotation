    "pre_caption": "A tennis ball is hit by a racket and flies toward a pink water balloon. Upon impact, the balloon's surface stretches and wraps around the ball. The ball is momentarily enveloped before it rebounds out of the balloon and moves away to the right. The now-deformed balloon then falls off the stone paver to the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A round, pink water balloon rests on a circular grey stone paver. To the right, the leg of a person wearing light-colored shorts is visible. The person swings a black and yellow tennis racket, striking a yellow-green tennis ball. The ball flies into the water balloon, causing the balloon to deform and stretch, momentarily enveloping the ball without popping. The tennis ball then bounces back out, and the now-crumpled pink balloon falls off the paver.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good chronological summary of the action, but it lacks the specific dynamic details that would make such a video compelling. The description of the balloon falling \"to the left\" while the ball moves \"to the right\" seems physically improbable; in a direct impact, the balloon would likely be pushed backward or in the same direction as the ball. The caption also completely omits any mention of the slow-motion effect, which would be essential for observing this type of impact, failing to describe the gradual, elastic deformation and the dramatic rebound. Additionally, while it identifies a \"water balloon,\" it doesn't describe the visible motion of the water itself—the sloshing, rippling, and potential spray as the ball enters and exits—which would be a key visual element. A more vivid description would incorporate the slow-motion quality of the movement and the specific behavior of both the rubber and the water within the balloon.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In slow motion, a tennis ball is struck by a racket and hurtles toward a pink water balloon. As the ball makes contact, the balloon's surface stretches dramatically, wrapping around the ball in a mesmerizing display of elasticity. The water inside sloshes and ripples, creating a captivating visual of fluid motion. The ball is momentarily enveloped, causing a spray of water droplets, before it rebounds with force, continuing its path to the right. The balloon, now deformed and pushed backward by the impact, eventually falls off the stone paver, leaving a trail of glistening water in its wake.",
