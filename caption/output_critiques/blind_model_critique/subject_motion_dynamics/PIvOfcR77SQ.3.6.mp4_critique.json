    "pre_caption": "A man, holding a camera in a selfie-style shot, speaks while standing in a snowy landscape. He turns his head to his right to look at the yurts in the background before turning back to the camera. He then pans the camera to the right, showing more of the yurts and a bare tree, before panning back to the left to show a path and red buildings. He continues to speak and look around his surroundings throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with a light brown complexion, who appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s, is shown from the chest up in a selfie-style shot. He has short, black hair and a full, neatly trimmed black beard and mustache. He is wearing a black, hooded puffer jacket, which is open, revealing a maroon sweatshirt underneath with partially visible white lettering. Throughout the video, he speaks directly to the camera, his facial expression shifting as he talks and looks around his surroundings.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows:\n\nThe caption incorrectly describes the camera's motion as being separate from the man's. In a selfie-style video, the man holding the camera is the one moving, which in turn moves the camera's viewpoint. Stating that \"he rotates in place\" and then that \"the camera circles him\" is contradictory and confusing; the camera is not an independent entity circling him, but rather he is turning his body and arm to create a panning shot of the background. The description of the motion is also fragmented. It would be more accurate and chronologically sound to describe his rotation as a single, continuous action, noting the specific points where he pauses. For instance, you could describe him turning his body clockwise, briefly stopping his rotation to frame the yurts and tree, and then resuming his turn to show the path and buildings. Finally, the last sentence, \"He continues to speak and observe his surroundings throughout the video,\" is redundant, as the caption has already established that he is speaking and showcasing his surroundings.",
