    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A young man with brown skin and short, dark, curly hair appears throughout the video, speaking and gesturing expressively. He is wearing a dark, long-sleeved, quarter-zip pullover with a bright yellow-green zipper and collar lining. On the left side of his chest, there is a white logo featuring the word \"SPUNK\" and a small emblem containing white, yellow, and dark colors. He has stubble on his face and uses various hand movements as he talks, including waving, pointing with both index fingers, and gesturing with open palms.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately lists the sequence of hand gestures, but it lacks specificity and fails to connect the movements to the subject's communication. For instance, when the man points forward, it's unclear if he is pointing directly at the viewer to make a direct address or at something out of frame, which would change the context of the action. The description of \"gesturing outward with open palms\" is also ambiguous; it could be a slow, welcoming gesture or a quick, emphatic motion to present an idea, and the caption doesn't distinguish between these possibilities. Furthermore, while it mentions he is \"speaking continuously,\" it treats this as a background activity rather than the driving force behind the gestures. A more effective description would integrate the motions with the act of speaking, noting how he uses the pointing gesture to emphasize a key point or the open-palmed gesture to conclude a thought, and would also include any accompanying upper-body movement, such as leaning forward, which would add crucial detail to his overall motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A young man raises his right hand to wave at the camera, initiating his address. As he begins to speak, he lowers his arm and leans slightly forward, engaging the viewer. Mid-speech, he raises both hands and points forward with his index fingers, emphasizing a key point directly to the audience. He concludes his message by lowering his hands and gesturing outward with open palms in a slow, welcoming manner, reinforcing his final thought. Throughout, his upper body subtly leans forward, enhancing the connection with his audience.",
