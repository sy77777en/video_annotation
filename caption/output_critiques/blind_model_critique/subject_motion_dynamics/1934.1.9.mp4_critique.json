    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A person, viewed from their side and rear, stands wearing a white, full-body suit with a hood covering their head. The suit features a thin, vertical orange stripe running down the side of their arm and leg. This person holds a white, curved, hose-like apparatus. In the background, the lower halves of several other people are visible; they are also dressed in white, lab-style clothing and are positioned near white equipment. Following a bright white flash, the main person in the foreground disappears, leaving the hose-like object behind, while the people in the background remain in view.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the chronological order of events, starting with the static subject, describing the flash, the disappearance, and the subsequent fall of the object. However, the description of the subject's motion, or lack thereof, could be more specific. The initial state \"stands holding\" is vague; a more detailed description, such as \"stands motionless with the object held out in front of them,\" would provide a clearer starting point. The term \"vanishes\" is also general. If the video shows a specific visual effect for the disappearance, such as the person dissolving into particles of light or being pulled upwards in a beam, that specific motion should be described. Furthermore, the action of the object could be more detailed; instead of just \"falls,\" a description like \"is released and clatters onto the platform\" would better capture the interaction if sound or a bounce is implied. Finally, while the caption correctly notes the background figures are static, it could be more impactful to state that they \"remain motionless throughout the event,\" emphasizing their lack of reaction to the dramatic disappearance in the foreground.",
