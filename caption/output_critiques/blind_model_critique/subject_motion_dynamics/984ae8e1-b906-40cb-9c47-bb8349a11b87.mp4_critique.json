    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In this black-and-white video, a small, dark silhouette of a person is seen falling against a cloudy sky. The human-like figure, viewed from a great distance, maintains a consistent orientation as it descends, with its head, torso, and limbs visible in outline. The person ultimately disappears from view behind the dark silhouette of the houses located at the bottom of the scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the primary motion and chronological order, but it lacks specificity regarding the quality and details of the fall. While it mentions a \"consistent, supine orientation,\" it fails to describe the figure's specific posture; for instance, in the video, the person's arms and legs are spread wide in a stable star-like shape, not tucked or flailing, which is a crucial detail of the motion. The caption also misses the element of acceleration, as the figure clearly picks up speed in the first half of its descent before its velocity appears to stabilize. Furthermore, the term \"vertically downwards\" is an oversimplification; the figure has a slight but noticeable horizontal drift from left to right as it falls, likely due to wind that is also causing the background clouds to move slowly in the same direction. Describing the spread-eagled posture, the initial acceleration, and the slight horizontal drift would provide a much more precise and complete account of the subject's movement.",
