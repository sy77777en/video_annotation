  "generated_critique": "The caption uses speculative language (\"The only movement might come from\"), which violates the instruction to avoid uncertainty. It also focuses excessively on static visual elements like the lighting and the submarine's appearance, rather than its motion. In the video, the submarine itself is not completely motionless; it glides slowly and steadily forward through the murky water, and one of its periscopes performs a slow, continuous rotation from left to right. The caption misses these primary subject actions entirely, instead focusing on the secondary and less distinct movement of particles in the water. A more accurate description would prioritize the submarine's movement, stating that it moves forward while its periscope rotates, and then mention the drifting particles as a secondary detail.",
