    "pre_caption": "An isometric timeline, depicted as a segmented arrow, extends forward from a starting point labeled \"July 31, 2016.\" As the arrow progresses, its segments change color from yellow-green to orange and then red, while the text \"2017\" and \"Late 2017\" appear in sequence along its length.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **An isometric timeline graphic is presented on a dark gray grid. The timeline is shaped like an arrow and is composed of segments that change color from yellow-green at the beginning to orange and then red at the arrowhead. Positioned at the start of the timeline is a 3D, rounded square icon with a light blue background and a white border. Inside the icon is a cartoon cow with black and white spots, set within a circular frame. Below the cow, the words \"Çiftlik BANK\" are written in white. Various white text labels are placed along the timeline, including \"July 31, 2016\" near the start, \"2016,\" \"2017,\" and \"Late 2017\" near the red end. A yellow, triangular warning sign containing a black exclamation mark appears near the arrowhead.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the chronological sequence of events, but it could be more specific about the nature of the animations. For instance, \"extends forward\" is a bit general; the video might show the arrow being constructed segment by segment, with each new piece clicking into place, which is a more precise action. Similarly, the description of the color change could be enhanced. Instead of just stating the segments \"change color,\" the caption could describe *how* this happens—for example, the color might bleed from one segment to the next as it forms, or each new segment might pop in with its designated color already applied. The terms \"appear\" and \"materializes\" are also somewhat vague. The video likely shows the text fading into view above the timeline and the warning sign might pop into existence with a slight, quick vibration to draw attention, details that would add valuable precision to the description of the motion. Finally, the caption could better convey the synchronization of events, such as noting that the text \"2017\" fades in precisely as the arrow's color transitions from yellow-green to orange.",
