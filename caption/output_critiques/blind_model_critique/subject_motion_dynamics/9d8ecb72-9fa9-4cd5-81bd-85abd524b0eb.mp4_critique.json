    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A Black woman with dark, curly, shoulder-length hair is shown walking. She is wearing a light yellow, short-sleeved t-shirt and dark green leggings. A watch with a white strap and a black dial is visible on her left wrist.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the basic action and the camera's movement in chronological order, but it could be more specific about the subject's motion and the visual effect of the camera work. The description \"walks at a steady pace\" is generic; it could be improved by detailing the quality of her movement—for instance, if she walks with a relaxed, swaying gait or a more purposeful, direct stride. The caption also misses an opportunity to describe the interplay between the subject and her environment. As she walks past the \"lush green plants,\" the video likely shows sunlight filtering through the leaves, casting shifting patterns of light and shadow across her face and clothing, which is a key detail of her movement through the space. Furthermore, while the description of the camera tilting up and moving backward is technically correct, it fails to convey the resulting change in perspective. A more effective description would note how the viewpoint transitions from an observational high-angle shot to a more direct and engaging eye-level perspective, which fundamentally alters how the viewer relates to the subject as she approaches.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman strides forward on a paved path, initially captured from a low angle. Her purposeful, direct stride is complemented by the camera's upward tilt, which transitions from an observational high-angle shot to a more engaging eye-level perspective. As she moves past the lush green plants, sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dynamic patterns of light and shadow across her face and clothing, enhancing the visual interplay between her and the vibrant environment.",
