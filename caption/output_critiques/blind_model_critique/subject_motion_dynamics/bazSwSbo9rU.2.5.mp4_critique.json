    "pre_caption": "A man on his hands and knees pushes himself up from the floor of a dimly lit corridor and moves forward. As he rises to his feet, a second man appears, and they immediately begin to fight. The two men grapple and throw punches, with one man shoving the other against a brick wall during the altercation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two men in a dimly lit, narrow corridor. Initially, one man with dark hair, wearing a dark jacket over a dark shirt and dark pants, is seen on his hands and knees on the floor. He struggles to his feet and moves forward, at which point a second man appears. This second man is also dressed in dark clothing. The two men immediately engage in a physical fight, grappling and throwing punches at one another.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main sequence of events, it could be more precise about the nature and flow of the movements. The initial action feels slightly fragmented; the video shows the first man executing a single, continuous, and labored motion as he pushes himself from the floor to a standing position, rather than three distinct actions of pushing up, moving forward, and then rising. The description of the attack is also somewhat general. The second man emerges from a dark doorway on the right and executes a low, horizontal slash aimed at the first man's abdomen, not just a generic slash. Furthermore, \"restrain\" is not quite accurate for the defensive action; the first man performs a sharp, reflexive block, using his left forearm to parry the knife-wielding arm away. The counter-attack is simultaneous, but the punch is a specific right cross to the attacker's temple, which is what causes him to stagger back a few steps into the corridor wall, though he remains on his feet and retains his grip on the knife.",
