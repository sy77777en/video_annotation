    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a woman with long, dark hair walking forward from a dimly lit hallway. She is wearing a loose, oversized brown t-shirt that functions as a dress, paired with dark shorts mostly covered by the t-shirt, and white sneakers. As she walks toward the camera and out of the frame, the focus shifts to a smartwatch in the foreground. The watch, which was previously blurry, is now in sharp focus, revealing its square black face and blue band as it rests on a surface. A light-skinned hand then enters the frame from the right and reaches toward the smartwatch, causing the screen to light up and display a symmetrical kaleidoscope pattern in contrasting red and blue.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the basic sequence of events, but it lacks specificity and creates an ambiguous separation between the two main actions. The use of \"A woman\" followed by \"A hand\" suggests they could be two different subjects, whereas in the video, it is clearly the same woman's hand that re-enters the frame to interact with the watch. The description of the interaction itself—\"reaches toward\" and \"touch\"—is too general. The video shows a more precise action where the woman's index finger extends and firmly taps the center of the watch face. Furthermore, the caption omits the result of this interaction; it mentions the screen lights up but fails to describe that a digital clock face with a notification icon is displayed, which is a key detail. Finally, the description of the woman's initial movement as simply \"walks\" is understated; she walks briskly and purposefully out of the hallway, which adds a sense of urgency that the caption misses.",
