    "pre_caption": "A silhouetted figure in a long coat walks away from the camera down a dark, arched alley. As this person proceeds, two more figures are revealed following behind. One of these figures pushes another person seated in a wheelchair, while a third person, carrying a small animal on their shoulder, walks behind them. The entire group moves in a single file line away from the camera and toward the light at the end of the alley.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video first reveals a man, seen from behind as a dark silhouette, wearing a long coat and walking away from the camera. As he moves forward, two more figures appear behind him. One individual is wearing a dark, long overcoat and is pushing another person who is in a wheelchair. The last person is positioned closely behind them and is nearest to the camera, holding a small, dark dog on her left shoulder. All three people are presented as silhouettes moving towards the light at the end of the alley.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a significant factual inconsistency, stating that \"two more figures are revealed\" but then describing three additional people (one pushing a wheelchair, the person in it, and a third walking behind). Based on the video, three people, not two, emerge to follow the initial figure. The description of their reveal is also too vague; the video shows them stepping out from a deeply shadowed alcove on the right side of the alley, a detail that would add clarity. Furthermore, the sentence structure is somewhat convoluted and repetitive, particularly the final sentence which restates that the group is moving away in a single file line. The caption could be improved by specifying the slow, deliberate pace of the group's walk and noting the subtle motion of the small animal on the person's shoulder, which occasionally turns its head as they proceed down the alley. Correcting the number of subjects and describing the manner of their reveal and the tempo of their movement would make the description more accurate and informative.",
