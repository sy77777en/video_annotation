    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A dark, blurred silhouette of a person, seen from behind, occupies the foreground. This human figure wears a bulky, dark-colored jacket or hoodie. The other subject is a small, dark quadcopter drone, which is initially on the ground before it takes off and flies. The drone is characterized by its glowing red and green navigation lights, which are clearly visible against the dim sky.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately follows the chronological order of the drone's flight path and correctly notes the person's reaction, it misses a key interaction and could be more precise. The description of the person as simply \"watching\" is a significant omission; in the video, the silhouetted individual is clearly holding a remote controller with a small, illuminated screen, indicating they are the operator, not a passive observer. This context is crucial as it explains why they are tracking the drone so intently. Furthermore, the phrase \"tilting from side to side\" is somewhat ambiguous. The video shows the drone making a smooth, controlled bank to the left as it changes direction from a vertical ascent to forward flight, rather than an unstable wobble. A more accurate description would be that the drone \"banks to the left\" after its initial vertical ascent. Finally, stating the drone \"takes off from the ground\" and then \"initially ascends vertically\" is slightly redundant; combining these into a single, more concise action, such as \"ascends vertically from a field at dusk,\" would improve the flow.",

It is operated by a silhouetted person holding a remote controller with a small, illuminated screen, tracking the drone intently.
