    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A black, mirrorless Sony camera is mounted on a tripod in the foreground, with its flip-out screen angled out to the side. A light-skinned hand is visible holding and adjusting the camera. The camera is pointed across a body of choppy, greenish-blue water toward a distant cityscape. The city, featuring low-rise buildings and a prominent domed or spire-topped structure, is partially obscured by a thick, gray fog under an overcast sky. A small boat is visible on the water in the distance. The camera's screen shows a dark reflection of a person and a building.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's initial focus on the camera, tripod, and the operator's hand is a significant deviation from the instructions, which require describing the subject's motion, not the filming equipment or process. This detail is both irrelevant and confusing. Furthermore, the description of the main subject—the boat—is overly simplistic. Stating it \"travels from right to left\" misses an opportunity to provide the specific details requested. For instance, a more effective description would specify the type of motion and the boat's interaction with the water, such as, \"A small motorboat moves at a steady pace from right to left across the frame, gently rocking as it cuts through the small waves and leaving a white wake trailing behind it.\" This approach adheres to the instructions by focusing solely on the subject's movement and its interaction with the environment, providing a much clearer and more informative picture of the video's content.",
