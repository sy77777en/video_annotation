    "pre_caption": "A humanoid character in gold and blue armor walks from a dark, corrupted patch of ground toward a central pillar emitting a blue light. A semi-transparent, fiery humanoid shape follows the character's path. The character then turns and walks toward a large, white and gold structure, which flashes with light upon their approach. A second humanoid figure in brown armor follows the main character's movements throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A humanoid character is depicted wearing a gold helmet, a blue top, and brown bottom, with elaborate armor featuring large, spiked pauldrons and a helmet with prominent, wing-like adornments. This character wields a weapon that emits a red glow and is initially seen carrying a large, ornate shield on their back, later transitioning to holding it with one hand. Nearby stands a second humanoid figure in brown and metallic armor, also equipped with a large, ornate shield. On the dark, corrupted-looking ground near them, several patches of orange fire initially form a semi-transparent humanoid shape, which is visible and follows their movement. A large, white and gold angelic-looking structure with wing-like features and a glowing center is positioned on the ground between two tall, slender pillars that rise from a base emitting a bright blue light.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately lists the sequence of events but lacks specificity in describing the motion, making the scene feel static. For instance, \"walks\" is used twice, but it doesn't capture the character's gait; in the video, the character strides with a heavy, determined purpose, their armor clanking softly with each step. The description of the \"fiery humanoid shape\" as simply \"following\" is an understatement; it appears to be a spectral afterimage that peels off the main character's body with every few steps, gliding in their wake before dissipating, rather than being a separate, continuous entity. Similarly, the \"second humanoid figure\" doesn't just \"follow,\" but mirrors the main character's movements in perfect synchrony, like a bodyguard or a summoned ally marching in formation a few paces behind. The caption also misses the cause-and-effect interaction: the \"corrupted patch of ground\" visibly sizzles and recedes as the character steps off it, and the central structure's \"intermittent flashes\" are not random but pulse in direct response to the character's proximity, growing brighter and more frequent as they approach.",
