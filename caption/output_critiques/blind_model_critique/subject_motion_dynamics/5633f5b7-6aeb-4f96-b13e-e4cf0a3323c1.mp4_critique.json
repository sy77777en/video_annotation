    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Two people are shown in mid-air, gliding downwards while wearing specialized wingsuits. The suits are predominantly white with black sections on the shoulders, inner arms, and inner legs, and feature gold-colored patterns on the wing portions. Both individuals wear matching white and black helmets. They are positioned one above the other, holding their bodies horizontally with their arms and legs spread wide to catch the air.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good chronological foundation but misses key details and dynamic elements likely present in the video. The action of \"immediately\" spreading their arms and legs is probably inaccurate; the video likely shows a more distinct sequence where they push off, enter a brief freefall, and then purposefully inflate the wingsuits. The description of the flight path as a simple \"descent\" is too passive. The video would probably show them actively navigating the terrain, making sharp turns to hug the cliffside or weaving around rock formations, which is a core element of proximity flying. Furthermore, the formation is described as static, whereas the flyers might be shown changing positions, with one pulling ahead or dropping below the other to adjust their flight line. The most significant omission is the conclusion of the flight; the caption stops mid-air, but the video would almost certainly culminate with the critical motion of both individuals deploying their parachutes, transitioning from gliding to floating under canopy.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Two people in wingsuits leap from a rocky cliff, entering a brief freefall before purposefully inflating their wingsuits to begin gliding. They skillfully navigate the terrain, making sharp turns to hug the cliffside and weaving around rock formations, showcasing the dynamic nature of proximity flying. Throughout the flight, they adjust their positions, with one occasionally pulling ahead or dropping below the other to refine their flight line. The exhilarating journey concludes as both individuals deploy their parachutes, smoothly transitioning from gliding to floating under canopy.",
