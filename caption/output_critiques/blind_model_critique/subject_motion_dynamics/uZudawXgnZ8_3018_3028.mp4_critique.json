    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a third-person, top-down 2D game scene, two pixelated characters stand on a wooden pier. The character on the left has blue hair and wears a red top with blue pants. To their right stands a man with a brown beard, wearing a red shirt and a brown hat. A dialogue box subsequently appears in the lower portion of the view, featuring a more detailed pixel-art portrait of the man from the chest up, confirming his brown beard, red shirt, and brown hat.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's assertion that the characters \"remain stationary\" may be inaccurate, as pixel art characters frequently have subtle idle animations like breathing, blinking, or hair moving in the wind, which constitute motion and should be described. The description of the dialogue box is a good start, but it could be more precise by specifying *how* the text changes, such as appearing letter by letter or sentence by sentence. The phrase \"yellow land boundary\" is technical and could be more clearly described as \"the sandy shoreline\" or \"the edge of the beach.\" Rather than focusing on the boundary's undulation, it would be more direct to describe the water's movement itself, for example, \"the pixelated water ripples against the shore.\" Lastly, the phrase \"resembling the gentle motion of waves\" is subjective and comparative; the instructions require describing only the visible action, so mentioning what it \"resembles\" and using the adjective \"gentle\" should be avoided in favor of a direct, objective description of the motion.",
