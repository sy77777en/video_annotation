    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective inside a futuristic pod, a red fire extinguisher falls from the left and lands on the floor. The main lights suddenly turn off, and flashing red emergency lights activate, bathing the interior in red. Smoke begins to fill the pod as sparks fly from a wall panel. A red rectangular panel then detaches from the wall and tumbles onto the floor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a first-person perspective, a character wearing an orange and black suit is inside a small, circular, futuristic pod. The pod's interior is initially white after the lights turn on, with a black ladder located in the center of the pod and a circular hatch on the floor. A large screen displays a \"LAUNCH SEQUENCE ACTIVE\" warning in red text. A red fire extinguisher falls onto the floor. The environment abruptly changes as the main lights go out, replaced by flashing red emergency lights. Smoke fills the pod, sparks fly from a wall panel, and a red rectangular panel detaches from the wall, falling to the floor as the situation deteriorates.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the sequence of events, it could be more precise about the cause-and-effect relationships and the specific nature of the motions. The description begins with the fire extinguisher falling, but it omits the initial, violent shudder of the pod that likely causes it to be dislodged from its wall mount. The caption also describes the sparks and the detaching panel as separate events, whereas in the video, the sparks erupt directly from the seams of the red rectangular panel, which then glows and warps from the heat before it breaks loose and crashes to the floor. Furthermore, the description of the smoke could be more specific; it doesn't just \"fill the pod\" but rather billows out in a thick, black plume from the newly formed opening where the panel was. Finally, the caption misses the motion of the camera itself; the first-person view jerks sharply to the left as the extinguisher falls and then pans upward toward the sparking panel, which is a key part of the action from that perspective.",
