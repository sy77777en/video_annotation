    "pre_caption": "A woman and a man initially stand close together, both holding onto and leaning into a single microphone. They then separate, with the man spinning away to the right while kicking one leg up. Simultaneously, the woman takes sole possession of the microphone, turns to face forward, and continues to move her body.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A woman with light skin and short, shaggy platinum blonde hair stands next to a man with darker skin and dark hair mostly covered by a backward cap. The woman is wearing a black leather jacket, a black skirt, red socks, and light-colored sneakers. The man is dressed in a matching black leather jacket over a white t-shirt, a red and black plaid kilt, and white sneakers. Initially, they are positioned close together, jointly holding a single microphone as they perform energetically. Later, they separate, with the man spinning around and the woman taking the microphone herself and facing the camera.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the chronological order of events, but it could be more precise about the nature of the movements. The initial description, \"stand close together,\" is vague; in the video, the man and woman are standing side-by-side, both facing forward and leaning their heads together toward the centrally-placed microphone. The phrase \"continues to move her body\" is the weakest part of the description, as it is not specific. After taking the microphone, the woman does not just \"move\"; she firmly grips the microphone stand with both hands, pulls it directly in front of her, and sways her hips in a rhythmic motion, suggesting she is about to sing or is dancing to a beat. Additionally, the man's spin is not just \"away to the right\"; it is a full 360-degree pirouette on the spot, ending with him facing forward again, but now several feet away from the woman. A more detailed description of the woman's specific dance-like movements and the man's full rotation would provide a much clearer picture of the performance.",
