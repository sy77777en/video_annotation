    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject of this animated video is a tall, thin man with a long face, black hair parted on the side, and white glasses. He is wearing a pink long-sleeved button-up shirt, a dark tie, and dark purple pants. He stands and pushes a large, green filing cabinet or cart, which has a yellow envelope symbol on its front, through an office environment. The office is populated by other men who are identical in appearance, all with black hair and wearing the same pink shirts. These men are seated in green office chairs at their desks, viewed from behind, each holding a white mug. They are focused on their computer monitors, which display an animation of a figure pushing a large boulder up a hill. The desks also feature other recurring items, including calendars with images of people in suggestive poses, clocks with a man's figure whose arms act as the hands, and a framed photo of a man in a pink shirt.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the primary motion and chronological order, but it could be more specific about the nature of the actions and relies on some interpretation. For instance, stating the man's motion is \"steady\" and \"continuous\" is good, but the description could be enhanced by detailing *how* he pushes the cart—for example, if he is leaning into it with both hands, suggesting the cart is heavy. The phrase \"identical men\" is an assumption; a more objective description would be to state that he passes men who are all dressed in the same attire and sitting in the same posture, which visually implies they are identical without stating it as a fact. The caption also misses an opportunity to describe the contents of the cart, if visible (e.g., if it's filled with boxes or files), which would add context to his task. Finally, describing the environment as \"monotonous\" is a subjective adjective; the feeling of monotony is better conveyed by sticking to the objective facts already mentioned—the repetition of the background figures and the looping nature of the action. The description of the loop itself could be more integrated into the motion, such as \"he pushes the cart across the frame from left to right, exits, and then immediately re-enters from the left to repeat the action.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A tall man in a pink shirt leans into a large green cart, pushing it with both hands from left to right through an office. The camera pans to follow his steady, continuous motion. As he moves, he passes men who are all dressed in the same attire and sitting in the same posture at their desks, focused on their computer screens. The cart appears to be filled with boxes, suggesting a task of transporting items. The video loops seamlessly, as he pushes the cart across the frame, exits, and then immediately re-enters from the left to repeat the action, emphasizing the repetitive nature of the scene.",
