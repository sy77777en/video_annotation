    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should reflect how their motion and dynamics contribute to this instability.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a shallow depth of field effect, focusing on a person wearing a tan, loose-fitting coat with a matching hood, riding a brown horse. Initially, only a portion of the person's body is visible. As an object swiftly moves through the foreground, the subject, who is moving away from the camera, gradually recedes into the distance, causing the frame to progressively lose focus.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The caption correctly identifies the main sequence of events but lacks specificity and focuses too much on cinematography rather than the subject's motion. The description of \"An object swiftly moves through the foreground\" is too vague; for instance, the video shows a bird flying low past the horse's head, which is the clear catalyst for the subsequent action. The caption should identify this object to provide context. Furthermore, the description of the motion is oversimplified. Instead of just \"gallops away,\" the video shows the horse being startled, rearing slightly, and then bolting into a gallop. Similarly, \"the rider's body jolts\" is a weak description of the action; the rider is seen actively leaning forward, gripping the reins, and bouncing in the saddle to absorb the horse's powerful, rhythmic movements as they try to regain control. The mention of \"shallow depth of field\" and the frame losing focus, while accurate, detracts from the primary goal of describing the subject's actions in a concise, action-oriented paragraph. A better caption would specify the startling object and provide a more dynamic description of how both the horse and rider move in reaction to it.",

The rider leans forward, gripping the reins tightly, and bounces in the saddle, trying to regain control as the horse's powerful, rhythmic strides carry them swiftly away from the camera.",
