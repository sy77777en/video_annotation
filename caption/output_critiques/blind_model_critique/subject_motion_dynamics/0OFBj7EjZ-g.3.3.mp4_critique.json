    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Three low-polygon, humanoid figures stand together. The central figure is entirely white, with shadows creating a grayish appearance, and wears a large, open, crinkled golden coat over a white garment at its neck. It stands still, facing forward. To its left and right are two red figures with a similar faceted appearance. The red figure on the right is facing the left side of the frame, standing straight with its arms at its sides, wearing what appears to be a hooded sweatshirt and pants. The red figure on the left, dressed similarly, has its right arm bent at the waist, its left hand raised to its chest, and its head slightly bowed. The video starts with a view of their upper bodies and then reveals their full forms as the perspective pulls back.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies that the three figures are stationary and accurately describes the camera's general movement in chronological order, it lacks specificity that would create a clearer mental image of the video. The description of the figures as \"humanoid\" is adequate, but the caption could be improved by specifying their arrangement, such as if they are standing side-by-side or in a triangular formation. The most significant weakness is the vague phrase \"revealing... the surrounding scene.\" A more effective caption would describe what is actually revealed; for instance, if the camera movement shows they are standing on a reflective floor, a gridded plane, or within a minimalist room. By failing to describe the environment that the camera movement is explicitly designed to reveal, the caption misses a key piece of visual information and feels incomplete.",

The camera begins with a medium shot focused on their upper bodies and then slowly pulls back and elevates, revealing their full forms. As the camera continues to move, it unveils the surrounding environment: a minimalist room with a reflective floor that mirrors the figures and a gridded plane extending into the distance.",
