    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A large, ornate clock is centrally featured on the facade of a light-colored stone building at night. The clock face is circular, white, and illuminated from behind, causing it to glow. It has black Roman numerals and intricate black hands. The clock is set within a large, carved stone arch. Below the clock, the words \"PARIS-ORLEANS\" are carved into the stone in a dark, capitalized font. The building is occasionally illuminated by lights that cover its entire facade, highlighting its detailed architectural features against a dark, cloudy sky.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the time-lapse nature of the video and the two main actions, but it lacks specificity and misses key visual information. The phrase \"lights flash and change\" is too generic; in the video, the lights don't just flash randomly but rather sweep upwards from the base of the building to the top in synchronized waves of blue and white. The caption also includes the interpretive phrase \"highlighting its architectural details,\" which describes the effect of the lights rather than their actual motion. Furthermore, the description is incomplete as it omits the significant background and foreground motion present in the time-lapse; for example, it fails to mention the streaks of red and white light from moving traffic visible on the street below the building, as well as the fast-moving clouds passing behind the clock tower in the night sky. A more accurate description would detail the specific wave-like motion of the facade lights and incorporate the movement of the traffic and clouds.",

Simultaneously, synchronized waves of blue and white lights sweep upwards from the base to the top of the building's facade.
