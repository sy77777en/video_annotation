    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A group of spectators, mostly white men and women, are gathered in stadium seating, leaning against a metal railing with tense expressions. A man with short blond hair, wearing a black jacket, a gold chain, and blue jeans, stands with his hands on the railing, looking forward seriously. To his left, a man in a black jacket and blue jeans leans forward heavily on the railing, looking intently ahead. Behind him, another man in a striped black and grey shirt stands behind a man wearing a black jacket over a yellow t-shirt, all with focused gazes. To the right and slightly behind the blond man, a man in a black jacket and a woman with red hair, who has her hand to her head, both have concerned expressions. In the lower portion of the frame, a man with dark hair in a black hooded jacket is holding the railing with his arm. Additionally, there are more individuals with yellow hair or wearing yellow-fur hats peering through the bars of the railing. The crowd is dressed predominantly in black and yellow clothing, with some individuals wearing yellow headbands or holding yellow cloths.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows:\n\nThe caption correctly identifies the subjects as spectators and notes their general lack of movement, but it could be improved by adhering more strictly to the instructions. The phrase \"tense expressions\" is a subjective interpretation of emotion, which the instructions advise against. Instead, you could describe the physical manifestations, such as \"their mouths are slightly open\" or \"their brows are furrowed.\" Furthermore, the description of the subjects as \"largely stationary\" and having \"no significant movement\" is too general. In a video, there would likely be subtle, observable motions. For instance, you could have described how their heads and eyes slowly track from left to right, following an unseen event, or how one individual's hands tighten their grip on the railing. Focusing on these specific micro-actions would provide a more accurate and detailed account of their motion, shifting the focus from the camera's movement to the subjects' behavior as instructed.",
