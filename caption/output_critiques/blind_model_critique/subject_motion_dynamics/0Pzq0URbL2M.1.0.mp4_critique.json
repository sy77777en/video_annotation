    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **An animated sequence unfolds on a dark, textured map featuring faint grey lines and several lake-like shapes. A white line traces a territory around a central, crescent-shaped lake, which then fills with a light, parchment-colored texture. On this territory, the words \"LEAGUE OF NATIONS\" appear in a dark font above a blue, star-like symbol. A label with the word \"GENEVA\" in a black box points to a location on this territory. To the right, a rectangular graphic with tattered edges appears, depicting the Japanese flag, which consists of a red circle on a white background. A straight white line is then drawn, connecting the League of Nations territory to the Japanese flag graphic.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the chronological order of the motion graphics, but it lacks specificity regarding the style of the animations. For instance, the white line doesn't just \"animate\"; it smoothly draws itself onto the map as if by an invisible pen. The description of the area \"filling with a light color\" is also too general; in the video, the color seems to bleed into the shape from the center outwards with a soft, glowing effect. The caption states the text and symbol \"appear,\" but they actually fade into view sequentially, with \"LEAGUE OF NATIONS\" appearing first, followed by the symbol, and then the \"GENEVA\" label is typed out letter by letter beneath them. Finally, the connecting line doesn't just get \"drawn\"; it shoots out rapidly from the \"GENEVA\" label and stops abruptly at the Japanese flag, pulsing once upon arrival to emphasize the newly established link.",
