    "pre_caption": "A small, luminous creature jumps from a ledge and bounces upwards off a series of translucent, turquoise plants growing on the right-hand wall. With each bounce, the creature ascends higher, and the plants release glowing, disc-shaped structures. After several bounces, it leaps to the left and lands on a higher ledge. A small, floating orb of blue light follows the creature's movements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A small, luminous, white creature with a quadrupedal, animal-like form, featuring long ears and a tail, is the central subject. This creature emits a bright white and blue glow and has large, dark eyes. It is accompanied by a small, floating orb of bright blue light. The creature climbs up the right-hand rock face, using translucent, turquoise plants growing there. When the creature interacts with these plants, disc-shaped structures emitting a blue-green light are revealed. To the right is a large, stationary formation covered in sharp, green-glowing spikes. In the upper portion of the scene, a small, reddish-purple creature with a rounded body is visible on a dark ledge.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the chronological sequence of events, it could be more specific about the nature of the movements. For instance, instead of just \"bouncing,\" the video shows the creature curling into a tight ball before each impact with the turquoise plants, which visibly compress and then spring back to launch it upwards. The description of the released \"disc-shaped structures\" is missing their subsequent motion; they don't just appear, they drift slowly upwards and fade out. Furthermore, the phrase \"follows the creature's movements\" for the blue orb is too general; the orb actually lags slightly behind the creature, bobbing up and down in a gentle, wave-like pattern that contrasts with the creature's sharp, angular bounces. Finally, the \"leap to the right\" could be more descriptive, as the creature is shown extending its limbs and arching gracefully through the air before making a soft landing on the ledge.",
