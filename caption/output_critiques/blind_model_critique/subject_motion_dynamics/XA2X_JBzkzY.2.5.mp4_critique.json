    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A young, fair-skinned man with reddish-blond, shoulder-length curled hair sits on the ground, looking forward with a somber expression. He is dressed in a white shirt with a high collar and ruffled lace decoration. To his left, a fair-skinned woman sits in an ornate chair, her right hand resting on his shoulder. She has dark hair styled under a large, feathered hat and wears a low-cut, light-colored gown with a pearl necklace and bracelet. To the young man's right, another fair-skinned man sits in a similar chair, initially expressionless but eventually breaking into a smile. He wears a brown coat, a white ruffled shirt, white stockings, and a brown hat. As the view widens, a large crowd of men, women, and children, all in 18th-century aristocratic attire, is revealed sitting behind them, watching an event off-screen.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the chronological order of the camera's zoom-out and the main actions, but it lacks specificity regarding the subjects' movements and interactions. For instance, describing the young man as just \"blinking slightly\" misses the more significant action of him slowly lifting his head and looking around with a dazed expression as he comes to. The description of the second man laughing is good, but it omits the crucial detail that he glances down at the young man on the ground before turning his attention forward and laughing, which clarifies their relationship within the scene. The most significant weakness is the vague description of the crowd's \"slight movements.\" A more accurate caption would detail these actions, noting that many in the audience are fanning themselves with period-style fans, while others lean forward and murmur to their neighbors, creating a more vivid and dynamic picture of the attentive 18th-century audience.",
