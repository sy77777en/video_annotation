    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A pair of light-skinned hands, resembling those of a puppet, carefully wraps a small, round, gold-colored clock in a piece of red, textured cloth. The clock has a white face with Roman numerals, black hands, and a cracked glass cover; the letters \"BIJ\" and the word \"QUARTZ\" are visible on the dial. The hands fold the red cloth around the clock, creating a small bundle. In the blurred background, a framed photograph of several people and items of clothing are visible, seemingly located in a drawer.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subjects and presents their actions in chronological order, but it could be improved by providing more specific details about the motion itself. The word \"carefully\" is a subjective interpretation of the action's manner rather than a description of the movement; a more objective alternative would be to describe the slow and deliberate motion of the hand. The description of \"folds the cloth's corners\" is vague; a more precise account would specify the sequence of the folding, such as the right hand lifting and folding each of the four corners over the clock in a specific order. Furthermore, the caption includes appearance details (\"gold-colored,\" \"red\") which the instructions advise against unless needed for differentiation. Finally, the last action is simplified. The video likely shows the hands moving downward toward the drawer, one hand pulling the drawer open, placing the bundle inside, and then pushing the drawer shut, all of which are distinct motions that are currently condensed into the single act of \"plac[ing] the bundled clock into a drawer.\"",
