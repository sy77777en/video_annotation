    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video features a single African bush elephant with grey-brown, wrinkled skin. The elephant has large, floppy ears and two white tusks, with the one on its left side being more prominent. Initially, the elephant is seen from the feet up, facing mostly forward and looking slightly toward the right of the frame. It then turns its head further to its left, showing its right profile to the camera as it interacts with the surrounding vegetation.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subject and presents its actions in chronological order, but it lacks specificity regarding the key movements. The term \"browses\" is too general and fails to describe the most significant action in the video: the elephant extending its trunk, wrapping it around a leafy branch on a thorny bush, and pulling the foliage into its mouth. This interaction with the environment is central to the scene and should be explicitly detailed. Similarly, the phrase \"appearing to chew\" is speculative; the visible, rhythmic grinding motion of the elephant's jaw should be described directly as chewing. The description of the elephant stepping forward is mentioned twice in a slightly redundant manner. A more effective caption would integrate these actions into a single, fluid sequence, such as describing the elephant turning its head, using its trunk to grab a branch, and then stepping forward through the brush while actively chewing.",
