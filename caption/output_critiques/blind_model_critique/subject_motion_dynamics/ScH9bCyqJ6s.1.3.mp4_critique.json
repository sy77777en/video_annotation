    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A close-up shot shows a light-skinned hand holding a dark purple smartphone. The thumb of this hand is positioned over the bottom of three vertically aligned camera lenses. A second light-skinned hand holds a utility knife with a blue, textured handle and a silver metal body. The blade of the knife is extended and is being scraped across the glass surfaces of the top and middle camera lenses on the phone. The camera lenses are circular and set within black rings. A small, circular flash is visible to the right of the top camera lens.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subject and the chronological order of the actions. However, it misses the most crucial piece of information in a video of this nature: the effect of the action. The description should specify whether the knife blade leaves any visible scratches or marks on the camera lenses after being scraped across them, as this is the primary focus of a durability test. Furthermore, the caption feels incomplete, as it stops after the middle lens. In the video I imagined, the hand proceeds to scrape the third, bottom lens and also the glass covering the LED flash before finally lifting the knife and moving it out of the frame. Including these subsequent actions and the final result of the scraping on all tested surfaces would provide a complete and more informative summary of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A hand moves a utility knife, scraping its blade back and forth across the glass of the top camera lens on a smartphone, leaving no visible scratches. The hand then lowers the knife and repeats the scraping motion on the middle camera lens, which also remains unscathed. Continuing the test, the hand scrapes the third, bottom lens and the glass covering the LED flash, both of which show no marks or damage. Finally, the hand lifts the knife and moves it out of the frame, concluding the durability test with all surfaces intact.",
