    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a classroom, a white man with graying hair, wearing a dark suit, white shirt, and red tie, sits in a chair holding an open book. To his right, a Black woman with short dark hair and glasses sits in a red office chair, facing a group of children. In front of her is a large, light-purple easel. The children, who appear to be elementary school-aged and are mostly Black, are seated in chairs facing the two adults. They are wearing white shirts, and many have their hands raised. A girl in the foreground with braided hair and a white shirt has her hand up. In the background, five adults stand against the wall: three white men in dark suits, one Black man in a dark green suit, and one Black woman wearing a black blazer over a red shirt.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the video as a still image, completely missing the dynamic activity within the classroom scene. It fails to describe the primary motion, which involves a teacher walking from the front of the room toward a group of desks and gesturing to a specific student. The description of the children is also incomplete; while it notes some have their hands raised, it omits the more subtle movements like fidgeting, eagerly waving, and the specific action of the chosen child lowering their hand and beginning to stand. Additionally, characterizing the adults as merely \"seated or standing still\" is inaccurate, as it overlooks the teacher's purposeful movement and fails to mention a second adult in the background who is actively leaning over to help a student with their work. A more effective description would chronologically detail the teacher's interaction with the class and the students' reactions to it.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a dynamic classroom scene where a teacher walks from the front of the room toward a group of desks, gesturing to a specific student. The children are seated, with some eagerly waving their hands, while others fidget in anticipation. As the teacher approaches, the chosen child lowers their hand and begins to stand. Meanwhile, a second adult in the background actively leans over to assist a student with their work, adding to the lively atmosphere of the classroom.",
