    "pre_caption": "A computer-generated animation shows a white passenger jet descending toward an airport at night. The jet is on a final approach, but it is aligned with a taxiway where two other jets are stationary. Before reaching the ground, the approaching aircraft aborts its landing, pulls up, and climbs away from the airport. The two jets on the taxiway remain motionless throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A computer-generated animation depicts a nighttime scene at an airport, focusing on a potential aviation incident. The main subject is a white passenger jet shown in the air on a landing approach. On the ground, four other white passenger jets are stationary on a taxiway. The situation's urgency is conveyed through a series of text overlays representing radio communications. A light blue text from \"UAL1\" questions the approaching plane's trajectory, stating, \"Where is this guy going?\" This is followed by a yellow text from \"SFO TWR\" issuing a command: \"Air Canada, go around.\" In response, the animation shows the airborne jet aborting its landing and climbing away, while a final red text from \"ACA759\" confirms, \"In the go around, Air Canada 759.\"**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the chronological sequence of events but could be more specific about the motion to better reflect the visual details. The description of the descent is generic; the video likely shows the jet with its landing gear down and landing lights illuminated, which are key visual indicators of an imminent landing. The caption also understates the critical moment of the aborted landing. Instead of just \"Before reaching the ground,\" a more precise description would note that the aircraft descends to a very low altitude directly over the stationary jets, with its landing lights sweeping across them, visually highlighting the imminent danger. Furthermore, the phrase \"pulls up, and climbs away\" is a simplification of a dynamic maneuver. The video would show the jet's nose pitching up sharply as its engines power up for a steep ascent, and its landing gear would likely begin to retract as it banks and turns away from the airport, details that are missing from the current description.",
