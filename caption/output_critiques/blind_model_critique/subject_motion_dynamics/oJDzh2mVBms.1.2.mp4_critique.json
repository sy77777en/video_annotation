  "generated_critique": "The provided caption fails to describe the subject's motion, which is the central requirement of the instructions, especially for a time-lapse video. Instead of detailing the movement of the aurora and clouds, the caption focuses entirely on describing a static scene, mentioning the \"tall, snow-dusted evergreen tree\" and \"snowy landscape,\" which are stationary elements. The caption also violates the instruction to avoid emotional adjectives by using the word \"breathtaking.\" A more accurate description would focus on the dynamic elements. For instance, you could have described how the green aurora borealis first appears as a faint arc, then intensifies, shimmering and pulsing in vertical waves as it drifts across the upper portion of the frame from right to left. You could also have mentioned the secondary motion of scattered clouds scudding quickly across the lower sky, partially obscuring the stars as they pass, while the foreground trees and landscape remain fixed.",

The green aurora first appears as a faint arc, then intensifies, shimmering and pulsing in vertical waves as it drifts from right to left. Meanwhile, scattered clouds scud quickly across the lower sky, partially obscuring the stars as they pass, while the tall, snow-dusted evergreen tree and snowy landscape remain stationary in the foreground.",
