    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a blurry view of a shirtless man moving forward and pushing through a large white fabric. A woman then enters from the left, also pushing through the fabric as she chases after the man. Both individuals run away from the camera, one after the other, into the distance. The white fabric briefly obscures the view before moving out of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a shirtless man with dark skin, short dark hair, and brown shorts positioned in the center of the foreground. He pushes through a large blur of white fabric. A woman with dark skin and shoulder-length dark curly hair, wearing a white sleeveless dress with a tie at the back, enters the frame from the left and chases after him. Both individuals run away from the camera, with the woman also pushing through the white fabric, which briefly obscures them before moving out of the frame. Instead of jogging side by side, the man and woman run forward one after the other. A thin, crooked wooden stick stands vertically in the foreground on the left as they continue to run into the distance.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly outlines the chronological sequence of events, it lacks specificity regarding the quality and detail of the motion. The description of the man \"moving forward and pushing\" is too general; a more effective caption would describe *how* he pushes through the fabric—for instance, whether he parts it gently with his hands or bursts through it forcefully. Similarly, the fabric's reaction is a key part of the motion that is omitted; the caption could specify if the fabric billows, ripples, or stretches as the subjects pass through it. The word \"chases\" introduces a subjective intent; it would be more objective to describe the woman's movement in relation to the man, such as \"a woman runs from the left and follows the man through the opening.\" Finally, the description of the fabric \"moving out of the frame\" is ambiguous. It would be clearer to state how this happens, for example, \"the white fabric billows back across the lens before being pulled away to the left,\" which describes a more distinct and final action in the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a blurry view of a shirtless man who bursts through a large white fabric, causing it to ripple dramatically. A woman then runs in from the left, following the man through the opening in the fabric. Both individuals continue running away from the camera, one after the other, into the distance.
