    "pre_caption": "A small, light blue airplane icon moves steadily from west to east across a map of Europe, following a designated flight path. The route originates in western Germany, traverses Poland, and extends into Ukraine. As the icon progresses, a dark blue line appears behind it, marking the completed portion of the journey, while the text labels for the countries gradually fade from view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A grayscale map of central and eastern Europe is shown, with the countries of Germany, Poland, and Ukraine labeled in dark, uppercase text that gradually fades out. A light blue line, representing the flight path, originates from a light blue dot in the western part of Germany, near the coast, and extends eastward across Germany, Poland, and into Ukraine. A small, light blue airplane icon is depicted moving along this path. A dark blue line indicates the portion of the route already traveled by the airplane icon, partially covering the light blue path starting from Germany.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately describes the general west-to-east movement and the drawing of the flight path, it misses some key visual specifics. The description of the \"designated flight path\" is incomplete; the video initially displays the entire route as a faint, dotted gray line, and the airplane icon's movement with the solid blue line behind it serves to fill in this pre-established path. The caption also omits that the path is not just a general traversal of countries but specifically connects marked points for major cities, beginning near Frankfurt, passing over Warsaw, and concluding in Kyiv. Furthermore, the description of the fading effect is not entirely accurate; as the plane icon passes a country, it's not just the text label that fades, but the entire country's colored fill desaturates to a uniform gray, making the completed portion of the map visually distinct. Finally, the caption implies the motion is continuous through Ukraine, whereas the video clearly shows the airplane icon slowing to a stop directly over the point marking Kyiv to signify the end of the journey.",
