    "pre_caption": "The camera slowly pulls back from a group of four people who are standing still in a dark room. They are gathered around a table, facing a framed portrait. As the camera continues to retreat, it moves through a doorway, revealing the exterior of a building with a wooden porch, a barrel, and a lit paper lantern. The people remain motionless throughout the entire shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows four people standing with their backs to the camera in a dimly lit room, facing a framed portrait. On the far left, a woman with dark skin and short, reddish-brown hair, wearing a dark sleeveless top, rests her hand on the shoulder of the woman beside her. This second woman also has short, reddish-brown hair and is wearing a dark, sleeveless dress. To their right stand two men, both dressed in light green, long-sleeved outfits. The man in the center stands looking forward, while the man on the far right has his head bowed. The group is gathered in front of a table, upon which rests a framed, black-and-white portrait of a man with a mustache, who is wearing a high-collared military uniform.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the chronological order of the camera's movement and the subjects' lack of motion, it could be more specific about the visual dynamics of the shot. The description of the camera \"pulling back\" is accurate but generic; it could be improved by detailing how the framing changes, for example, by mentioning that the doorway creates a frame-within-a-frame around the group as the camera retreats, making them appear smaller and more distant. The transition from the \"dark room\" to the exterior is a key moment, and the caption misses the opportunity to describe the shift in lighting, such as moving from the dimly lit interior into the warm, soft glow of the paper lantern on the porch. Furthermore, although the people are \"standing still,\" a more precise description of their posture—for instance, \"leaning over the table to gaze at the portrait\" or \"standing rigidly in a semi-circle\"—would add valuable detail without implying movement. The final sentence stating they \"remain motionless\" is slightly redundant and could be integrated more effectively by contrasting the camera's fluid retreat with the subjects' absolute stillness throughout the continuous shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera gradually retreats from a group of four people standing rigidly in a semi-circle around a table, intently gazing at a framed portrait in a dimly lit room. As the camera moves back, the doorway creates a frame-within-a-frame effect, making the group appear smaller and more distant. The transition from the shadowy interior to the exterior is marked by a shift in lighting, as the scene moves into the warm, soft glow of a paper lantern illuminating a wooden porch, complete with a barrel. Throughout this fluid camera movement, the people remain absolutely still, enhancing the contrast between their motionless presence and the dynamic retreat of the camera.",
