    "pre_caption": "A car with its headlights on drives from right to left across an industrial area at night. A large cloud of smoke billows into the foreground from the left, expanding to completely obscure the view. As the smoke momentarily thins, the car is briefly seen again, having continued its path further to the left before being covered by the smoke once more.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From an extreme high-angle perspective at night, a dark car, identifiable by its two bright headlights and a single red taillight, travels from right to left across an industrial area. A large, thick cloud of white dust or smoke billows into the foreground, completely enveloping the scene and hiding the car from sight. As the smoke thins out, the car is revealed again, having continued on its path, now visible further in the distance within a wider shot.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the chronological sequence of events, but it could be more precise about the nature of the motion and the interaction between the elements. The description of the smoke as \"billowing into the foreground\" is good, but it doesn't specify the smoke's origin or trajectory; for instance, it could clarify if the smoke erupts upwards from a vent before rolling across the ground, which would provide a more vivid picture of its movement. Furthermore, the relationship between the car and the smoke could be defined more clearly by stating that the car drives *behind* the expanding cloud, emphasizing the depth of the scene. The description of the car's reappearance is also slightly vague; specifying that the car is seen through a temporary gap in the swirling smoke would better convey the dynamic and transient nature of the reveal. Finally, describing the car as moving at a \"steady speed\" would add a layer of detail to its otherwise simple motion.",
