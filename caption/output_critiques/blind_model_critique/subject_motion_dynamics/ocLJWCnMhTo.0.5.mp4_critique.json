    "pre_caption": "A man sits still with his hands held out in front of him. A small, red ring of fire briefly appears above his right hand before vanishing. The camera then pans clockwise around the man. As the camera moves, a larger, rotating ring of orange and yellow fire materializes in the air to his left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A light-skinned man with a bald head, reddish-blond hair on the sides, and a matching beard and mustache is sitting and facing forward with his eyes tightly closed. He wears a light-colored, long-sleeved, patterned button-up shirt. His hands are held out in front of him with the palms facing up. At the beginning of the video, a red ring of fire is suspended in the air above his right hand but quickly vanishes. As the camera moves in a clockwise direction, a new rotating ring of fire, made up of orange and yellow flames, appears in the air in front of him.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the chronological order of events but could be more specific about the nature of the motion. The description \"sits still\" might be an oversimplification; for instance, the man could make a subtle gesture with his right hand, like a quick flick of the wrist, that coincides with the appearance of the small red ring. The term \"appears\" is also general; a more precise description might be that the ring \"ignites\" or \"flashes into existence.\" For the larger ring, \"materializes\" is vague. A more detailed account could describe how it forms, such as expanding outward from a central point of light or coalescing from a swirl of embers. Furthermore, the description of the ring \"rotating\" lacks a crucial detail: its axis. It would be clearer to specify if it is spinning horizontally like a platter or rotating vertically like a hula hoop. Finally, the caption ends as the ring appears, but the video likely shows it rotating for a few moments or even dissipating; the description should encompass the full duration of the motion shown.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man sits with a focused expression, subtly flicking his right wrist. In response, a small, red ring of fire ignites above his hand, flashing into existence before quickly vanishing. The camera then pans clockwise around him. As it moves, a larger ring of orange and yellow fire begins to form, expanding outward from a central point of light to his left. This ring spins vertically like a hula hoop, rotating gracefully in the air. The video captures the ring's mesmerizing motion as it continues to spin for a few moments before gradually dissipating into the surrounding air.",
