    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a nearly pitch-black setting, a slender, pale-skinned young man is faintly visible. He is wearing a baseball cap and a pale green or grey long-sleeved hooded shirt. Holding a small light source, likely a mobile phone flashlight, in his right hand, he initially squats to examine a canvas shoe in his left hand. He then suddenly releases the shoe and stands up, with much of his body still obscured by deep shadows.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately outlines the basic sequence of actions but misses the specific, deliberate nature of the subject's movements and the sense of tension they create. The term \"examining\" is too vague; in the video, the person holds the light source, which is clearly a smartphone flashlight, very close to the shoe, methodically running the focused beam along the seams and then tilting the shoe to peer deep inside it. The caption states the person \"abruptly releases the shoe,\" but the visual is more specific: the person's hand recoils as if from an electric shock, causing the shoe to drop to the concrete floor with a distinct, flat sound. Lastly, \"quickly stands up\" fails to capture the subject's reactive motion; they don't just stand, but rather pivot on one foot as they rise, bringing their body around to face the darkness behind them in a defensive posture, with the phone's light now sweeping across the empty space.",
