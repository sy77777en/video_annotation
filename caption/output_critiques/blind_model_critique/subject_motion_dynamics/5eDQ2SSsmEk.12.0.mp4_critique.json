    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a bird's eye view, top-down perspective, two people are seen in separate, narrow, dimly lit compartments. The person on the right, with short dark hair, wears a dark jacket and holds a handgun with both hands, aiming it forward toward the left side of the frame. To the left, another person with short, dark, wet-looking hair parted down the middle is standing and looking toward the first person. This individual wears a dark jacket with a textured, possibly armband, pattern on the shoulder.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies that the two subjects are mostly stationary within separate enclosures, but it is too general and lacks the specific details required by the instructions. The phrase \"slight movements\" is vague and fails to describe the actual actions occurring. For example, the video might show the individual on the left periodically looking down at a handheld device, with their thumb making small swiping motions, while the person on the right slowly turns their head to look out of a small window in their compartment. The caption misses the opportunity to differentiate the actions of the two subjects, instead grouping them into a single, non-descriptive state. A more effective description would specify these distinct, subtle motions in chronological order, such as, \"The individual in the left pod looks down and swipes a finger across a screen, while the individual in the right pod turns their head to the side and then back to the front.\" This would provide a much clearer and more informative account of the subjects' motion.",
