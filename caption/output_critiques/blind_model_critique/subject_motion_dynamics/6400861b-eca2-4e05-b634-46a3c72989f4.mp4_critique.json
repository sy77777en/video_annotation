    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A young woman with light skin and short, fluffy pink hair styled in a half-up ponytail is shown. She wears a dark blue athletic tank top with a cutout or criss-cross design on the back, accentuating the muscles in her shoulders and arms. Her arms are raised at her sides with elbows bent and forearms naturally lifted, hands slightly open, creating a dance-like pose. Initially, she is positioned side-facing towards the left of the frame, twirling in a field as if dancing. After completing a full turn, she faces the camera. The scene is partially obscured by blurry foliage, giving it a distinct, textured, dot-patterned appearance.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subject and the general direction of movement in chronological order, it lacks specificity regarding the quality and mechanics of the motion. The phrase \"spins in a continuous motion\" is somewhat ambiguous; if the video shows a single, fluid turn, a more precise description like \"pivots 180 degrees on the spot\" or \"completes a single, swift rotation\" would be more accurate than \"continuous.\" The description of the arms as \"raised and bent\" is a good start, but it could be more descriptive; for instance, the hands might be held close together above the head in a specific dance pose. Furthermore, the caption omits other key aspects of the body's motion. It doesn't mention if the person turns on the balls of their feet, nor does it describe the action of the head, which in a spin often turns last to \"spot\" a fixed point, whipping around to face forward at the end of the rotation. Adding these details would provide a much clearer and more complete picture of the subject's skilled movement.",
