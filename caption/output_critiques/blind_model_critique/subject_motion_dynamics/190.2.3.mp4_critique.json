    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A Black man with a goatee stands on a sidewalk, wearing a brown suede-like jacket, dark pants, a brown fedora with a black band, and dark sunglasses. He holds a small, silver object up to his mouth. The video starts with a shot of the man from the knees up, occupying about 30% of the lower part of the frame, and gradually zooms in for a close-up, focusing on his face. In the middle ground, a dark sedan is parked on the street.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the camera movement and framing but fails to provide a specific description of the subject's motion, instead offering a static and contradictory account. The phrase \"holds a small silver object to his mouth\" is too vague; if the video shows him playing a harmonica, for example, the caption should state this directly and describe the associated actions. The claim that the \"man remains stationary\" is likely inaccurate, as the close-up would reveal subtle but important movements related to his interaction with the object, such as his cheeks puffing, lips moving, or chest rising and falling with each breath. A better description would chronologically detail the man's actions, such as \"A man raises a silver harmonica to his mouth and begins to play, his head nodding slightly,\" as this would more accurately capture the motion that is the focus of the shot, especially during the transition to the close-up.",
