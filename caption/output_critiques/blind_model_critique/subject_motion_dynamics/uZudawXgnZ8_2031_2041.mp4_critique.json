    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a pixel-art video game scene, a player character with short, gray hair, a red shirt, and blue pants is shown. The character is situated on a farm that features a small wooden house, a large red barn, and an adjacent stone silo. A distinctive tree with a full canopy of purple blossoms stands near the barn and silo. The surrounding landscape is composed of green grass, dirt paths, various types of trees, and bushes.**",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the character's initial movement is somewhat unclear and could be more precise. Imagining the video, the character likely doesn't move in a continuous \"left and upward\" motion while swinging the scythe; instead, they probably take distinct steps to the left and upward between each swing. The caption could better reflect this by describing a sequence of steps and swings. Furthermore, the phrase \"clearing the weeds\" is generic; the video likely shows a more specific visual effect, such as the weeds disappearing in a puff of green particles or being cut down to leave collectible items, which would be a valuable detail to include. Finally, the description of the pathing—\"making a slight movement to the left midway\"—is likely an unnecessary detail unless it's a sharp, deliberate turn. A more concise description, such as \"walks north along the path,\" would be sufficient if the movement is just a minor course correction.",

As the scythe connects, the weeds disappear in a puff of green particles. After clearing the area, the character walks north along the dirt path until they exit the top of the frame.",
