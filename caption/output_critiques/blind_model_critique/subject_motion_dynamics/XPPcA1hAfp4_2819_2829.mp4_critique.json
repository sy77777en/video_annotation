    "pre_caption": "A pixelated character, initially standing in a garden plot, moves one step down, one step left, one step up, one step right, and then another step down, all within the plot. The character then walks down and left, exiting the garden area. Subsequently, it moves up and right to re-enter the garden, then takes a final step down and right. To the right of the garden, an orange, circular creature bounces in place.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A small, pixelated character with black hair, fair skin, and a red shirt is positioned within a tilled garden plot. The garden contains three distinct types of plants arranged in columns: one variety has green leaves and small red flowers, another features large, glowing, multifaceted blue gems, and the third has green leaves with orange flowers, along with some sprouts. To the right of the garden, a large, orange, circular, bubble-like creature is visible. In the lower-left area, which occasionally shifts to the upper-left as the camera tracks the character, there are several wooden, cross-shaped structures with green vines growing on them, and several red-capped mushrooms sit on the ground.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects and their general movements, it lacks chronological precision and specificity. The description of the orange creature's motion is presented separately at the end, disrupting the timeline; its bouncing occurs concurrently with the character's approach, not as a separate event. The term 'interacts' is too vague; the video likely shows a specific action, such as the character swinging a pixelated sword or using a tool to make contact. Similarly, 'eliminated' could be described more visually—for instance, the creature might flash and disappear or break into smaller pixels upon contact. A more effective description would integrate both subjects' actions into a single, chronological flow, specifying the exact nature of the interaction and its visual result at the moment it happens, rather than summarizing each subject's entire path independently.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A pixelated character stands in a garden plot and begins moving in a sequence: one step down, one step left, one step up, one step right, and another step down. As this happens, an orange, circular creature bounces in place to the right of the garden. The character then exits the garden by walking down and left, before re-entering by moving up and right. Upon re-entry, the character approaches the bouncing creature and swings a pixelated sword, causing the creature to flash and break into smaller pixels, effectively eliminating it. The character then takes a final step down and right within the garden.",
