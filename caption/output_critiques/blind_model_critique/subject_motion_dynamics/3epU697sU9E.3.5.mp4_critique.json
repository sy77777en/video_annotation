    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with an abstract view of white and dark lines on a brown surface. As the camera pans and moves, these lines are revealed to be the markings of an airport taxiway system seen from an aerial perspective. A white and light blue passenger airplane then appears, stationary on the ground, with engines mounted under its wings, casting a dark shadow on the taxiways below it.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the camera movement and the reveal of the airplane, but it focuses too heavily on the camera's mechanics rather than the subjects' actions. The phrase \"pans right while simultaneously moving right\" is confusing; a simpler description like \"the camera tracks right\" would be more effective. While the main subject (the airplane) is correctly identified as stationary, the caption misses an opportunity to describe other movements that are likely visible in a busy airport scene. For example, the video might show ground crew walking around the aircraft, a fuel truck approaching the wing, or baggage carts driving on a nearby service road. By omitting these details, the caption presents a static scene. A better description would incorporate these secondary movements, such as, \"As the camera reveals the stationary airplane, a baggage cart is seen driving past its tail,\" which would provide a more dynamic and complete picture of the activity in the video, adhering more closely to the instruction to describe subject motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera tracks right, pulling back from an abstract close-up of lines to reveal them as the markings of an airport taxiway system from an aerial perspective. As the camera continues its movement, a stationary passenger airplane is revealed on the taxiway. Nearby, a baggage cart drives past the airplane's tail, and ground crew members can be seen walking around, adding dynamic activity to the busy airport scene.",
