    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video opens on a young, light-skinned boy with brown hair floating in the ocean, holding onto a light blue and white boogie board. He wears blue and white swim goggles and a blue and orange snorkel. In the background, a large white and black catamaran with a tall mast and the name \"Kai Kanani II\" on its side is visible. The camera then submerges, and the boy and the boat are no longer in view. The scene transitions to an underwater view of a large, textured coral reef, which is mostly light green and beige. Small, spiny sea urchins and other small red marine creatures are scattered across the coral.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the chronological sequence of events and the camera's transition from above to below water, it misses key details about the motion of the subjects. The description of the boy simply \"floating\" is too passive; in the video, he is gently kicking his legs in the water to stabilize the boogie board against the small waves. The most significant omission is in the underwater scene. While the coral reef itself is stationary, the caption completely ignores the vibrant marine life. The camera's pan actually reveals numerous small, brightly colored fish darting in and out of the coral formations, which constitutes the primary motion in the second half of the video. Describing the reef as merely \"stationary\" fails to capture the dynamic ecosystem that is the focus of the underwater shot. Additionally, the description of the camera movement could be more precise; it first moves forward through the water for a moment and *then* begins its slow pan across the reef, rather than doing both simultaneously.",
