    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two white men in a professional setting. The initial focus is on an older, seated man with white hair, wearing a dark suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a patterned black and gray tie. He holds a pen and looks up attentively toward his upper right. A second, middle-aged man with short, graying hair and glasses is then revealed, standing and leaning slightly forward, facing the seated man on his left. This second man wears a light-colored pinstripe shirt, a red patterned tie, and a security badge on a lanyard around his neck. He is looking down and speaking to the seated man. As the camera moves, the profile of a Black woman enters from the bottom-left corner of the frame.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the initial action and the entrance of a second subject, but it creates a significant inconsistency by concluding with \"three individuals\" without ever describing how or when the third person becomes visible. The description of the camera's zoom-out is a missed opportunity; this camera movement is likely what reveals the third person, and the caption should explicitly connect the zoom to the widening of the frame to include this new subject. Furthermore, the descriptions of motion are too general. Instead of \"speaking to the seated man\" and \"listening attentively,\" the caption could specify the nature of their movements, such as the second man gesturing with his hands as he talks or the seated man slowly nodding and shifting his gaze between the other two people. The phrase \"largely static\" is an accurate summary but would be stronger if the specific, subtle movements that do occur were described to provide a more detailed picture of the quiet interaction.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens on a seated man looking up and to his right. A second man then leans into the frame from the left, gesturing with his hands as he speaks to the seated man. The seated man remains mostly still, occasionally nodding slowly and shifting his gaze between the other two people. As the camera gradually zooms out, a third person becomes visible, sitting quietly in the background. The scene is largely static, focusing on the quiet conversation, with subtle movements like the standing man's slight head movements and the seated man's attentive nods adding depth to the interaction.",
