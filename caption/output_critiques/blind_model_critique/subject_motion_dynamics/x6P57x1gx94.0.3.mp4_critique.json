    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with light skin, long dark hair reaching his neck, and no visible facial hair, wearing a black t-shirt and loose blue jeans, skateboarding. He is standing upright on a skateboard, facing forward as he moves along a covered walkway. In one part of the video, he approaches the camera, and in another, he is seen from behind as he moves away. There are also five other people visible in the middle ground, sitting or standing near a wall; they appear to be watching the man on the skateboard. These individuals are dressed in black clothing, and their features are less distinct due to their distance from the camera. The focus remains on the man skateboarding throughout the video.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the chronological sequence of events, it misrepresents the primary action on the ledge and lacks specificity in other areas. The video shows the man performing a \"50-50 grind,\" sliding on the board's trucks along the edge of the marble ledge, not simply \"rolling along\" its surface. This distinction is a crucial element of the skateboarding maneuver. Furthermore, the jump down the stairs is not just an ollie; the man also kicks the board, causing it to flip once horizontally in a \"kickflip\" before he lands on it. Finally, the description of the landing could be more detailed; after landing, the man visibly bends his knees to absorb the impact and then pushes off once with his right foot to accelerate as he rolls away under the walkway. The current caption omits these key technical details of the performance.",
