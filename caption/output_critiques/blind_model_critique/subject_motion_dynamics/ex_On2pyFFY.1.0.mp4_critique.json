    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects and a key event, it lacks specificity regarding the soldiers' movements and their reaction to the explosion. The description of them \"running\" could be improved by detailing their posture and pace; for instance, they might be running in a low crouch, moving tactically from one piece of cover to the next rather than in a continuous sprint. The most significant omission is the soldiers' reaction to the explosion. The caption states that it erupts, but fails to describe if the soldiers flinch, dive to the ground, or alter their course in response, which is a critical part of the action. Furthermore, the distinction between the \"two groups\" is unclear; the caption should specify if they are moving in sequence, in parallel, or if one group is providing cover while the other advances. Finally, the mention of the rising smoke feels disconnected; it would be more informative to clarify if this smoke is present from the start of the video or if it begins to rise during the action, and how it relates to the soldiers' path.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A large group of soldiers moves tactically in a scattered formation across a dusty, open area, crouching low as they advance from one piece of cover to the next between large concrete structures. They are divided into two groups, with one providing cover while the other advances toward the ruined buildings in the background. As they progress, an explosion erupts on the right side of the scene near one of the buildings, causing the soldiers to flinch and some to dive to the ground, while others quickly alter their course. Smoke begins to rise during the action, partially obscuring their path and adding to the chaotic atmosphere.",
