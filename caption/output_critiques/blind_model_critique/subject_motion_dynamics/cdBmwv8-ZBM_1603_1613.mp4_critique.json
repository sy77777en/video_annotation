    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with short, blond hair is seen from behind, wearing a dark, possibly brown, jacket with a light-colored shearling collar and cuffs, along with dark pants. As he walks forward, at the end of the road ahead, a shabby, closed double door appears.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the following imagined video content:\nA man is walking through a dark, cave-like passage at night. He is holding an old-fashioned oil lantern in his right hand, which is the primary light source. The lantern swings gently as he walks, causing the shadows of the surrounding rock formations and gnarled tree roots to shift and flicker dramatically on the walls. He walks at a slow, deliberate pace, placing his feet carefully on the uneven ground. The camera is positioned low and behind him, emphasizing the movement of his legs and the swinging lantern. As he nears the end of the path, he slows to a halt, and the steady beam from his now-stationary lantern fully illuminates a large, wooden double door set into the rock face.\n\n***\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the subject, the setting, and the chronological sequence of events, it lacks specificity regarding the quality of the man's motion and its interaction with the environment. The description \"walks forward\" and \"moves steadily\" is too generic; a more precise description might note that he proceeds at a slow, deliberate pace, suggesting caution on the uneven path. The most significant omission is the source of light. The caption mentions a \"dark\" and \"shadowy environment\" but fails to describe the lantern the man is carrying. This is a critical detail, as the swinging motion of the lantern would cause the shadows of the rocks and trees to shift and flicker, which is a primary visual element of the scene. Finally, the phrase \"revealing a closed double door\" is passive; a more active description would state that the man stops, and the light from his now-stationary lantern illuminates the door, directly linking his action to the final reveal.",
