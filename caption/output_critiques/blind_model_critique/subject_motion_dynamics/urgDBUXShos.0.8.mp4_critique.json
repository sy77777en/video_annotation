    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man, seen from over his right shoulder, confronts a woman in a close-up shot. The man has messy, wavy, blondish-green hair and is wearing a purple jacket. His face, partially visible, is covered in white makeup with dark coloration around his mouth. His right hand, clad in a purple leather glove, cups the right cheek of the light-skinned woman. The woman has brown hair pulled back, a dark sleeveless top, and a small earring in her left ear; her expression is tense. The man holds a metallic knife, positioning the blade near the corner of the woman's mouth.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main actions in chronological order, it could provide more specific detail about the nature of the movements and interactions. The description of the woman's reaction—closing her eyes and lowering her gaze—is accurate but potentially incomplete; it omits the subtle but crucial involuntary flinch or tensing of her cheek muscle at the exact moment the cold blade makes contact, a key part of her motion. Similarly, stating the man's hand \"holds\" and \"steadies\" her face is a bit general. A more precise description would note that his gloved fingers press firmly into her cheek, applying pressure to restrict her movement, which better defines the physical interaction. The reveal of the knife could also be clarified; specifying that the blade is extended from within the same hand already on her face would remove any ambiguity about how it appears. Finally, the man \"talks\" is a passive description; detailing the motion, such as his lips moving slowly and deliberately as he shakes his head, would add more substance to his action.",

From within the same hand already on her face, a metallic knife blade slides out and is pressed against the corner of her mouth. As the cold blade makes contact with her skin, the woman briefly closes her eyes, lowers her gaze, and her cheek muscle involuntarily flinches. Throughout the interaction, the man moves his lips slowly and deliberately, shaking his head slightly, while both individuals remain otherwise still.",
