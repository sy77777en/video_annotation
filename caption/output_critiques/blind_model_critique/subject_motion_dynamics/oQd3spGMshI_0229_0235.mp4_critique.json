    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject of the video is a middle-aged man with fair skin and short, light-colored hair. He is wearing a full-body, long-sleeved, light blue-grey wetsuit with a black device encircling his neck, connected to a nose clip by a black string. He is shown both underwater, where he removes the nose clip, and at the surface of the water, where he takes a large breath. A second person is also present, seen underwater near the man. This person wears a black wetsuit, a white-framed diving mask, a white snorkel, and black and white fins.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the main sequence of events, but it could be more specific about the nature of the movements and the interaction between the two individuals. The description of the ascent as simply \"begins to ascend\" is vague; the video likely shows a more specific action, such as the man pulling himself upward hand-over-hand along a visible guide rope. The role of the second person is also understated. Rather than just \"floating nearby,\" the person in the black wetsuit is likely an active safety diver, who I imagine meets the main diver at a shallow depth and escorts him to the surface, swimming alongside and observing him closely. The caption presents their surfacing as two separate events, whereas the video probably shows a coordinated action. Finally, \"takes a large breath\" could be more descriptive; the video likely shows a very specific and forceful recovery breathing technique, characterized by a sharp, audible inhale, which is a key detail of the freediving process.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man in a light blue-grey wetsuit floats vertically underwater, removes a nose clip from his face, and begins to ascend by pulling himself upward hand-over-hand along a visible guide rope. As he ascends, a second person in a black wetsuit, acting as an active safety diver, meets him at a shallow depth and escorts him to the surface, swimming alongside and observing him closely. Together, they break the surface in a coordinated action, where the man in the light blue-grey wetsuit performs a forceful recovery breathing technique, characterized by a sharp, audible inhale.",
