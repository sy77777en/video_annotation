    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A red, small hatchback car is seen from behind on a dark road at night. Its red taillights are illuminated. As the car gets closer, its license plate, which reads \"6N4 6583\", becomes visible. A circular logo, consistent with that of a Fiat, is centered on the rear of the vehicle.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately sets the scene, its primary weakness is its focus on the camera's movement (\"The camera moves forward\") rather than the subject's motion, which goes against the core instruction. The description of the car \"continuing along the road\" is too vague and misses key dynamic details that would be visible in the video. For example, the caption doesn't mention if the car's brake lights flash to indicate a change in speed, if a turn signal activates for an upcoming turn, or if the vehicle drifts slightly within its lane. It also fails to specify the nature of the car's movement—is it accelerating away, maintaining a constant speed, or navigating a slight curve in the road? A more effective caption would eliminate the description of the camera's action and instead provide specific details about the car's motion, such as whether it is maintaining a steady pace or its lights are interacting with the environment.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A red car drives steadily forward on a dark road at night, its brake lights occasionally flashing as it adjusts speed. The car's turn signal blinks, indicating an upcoming turn, while it navigates a gentle curve in the road. The vehicle drifts slightly within its lane, its headlights casting a glow on the surrounding environment.",
