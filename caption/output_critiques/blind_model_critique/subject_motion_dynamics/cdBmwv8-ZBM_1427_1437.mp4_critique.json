    "pre_caption": "A man walks forward along a stone path in a dark forest, passing under a large tree branch. He continues past an old, moss-covered truck and steps into a dilapidated wooden structure. He then approaches a wooden crate and smashes it with a downward strike, causing it to shatter into pieces and release a cloud of dust.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a third-person perspective, a man with short, blond hair is shown wearing a dark brown leather jacket with a light-colored shearling collar and cuffs. He walks through a dark, wooded area, passing an old, moss-covered truck partially obscured by tall grass. He then enters a dilapidated wooden structure and approaches a wooden crate with yellow and green markings. The man then smashes the crate, causing it to break apart into splinters and a cloud of dust.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the chronological sequence of events, but it could be more precise in describing the quality of the man's motion and his interaction with the environment. The term \"walks forward\" is generic; in the video, the man moves with a deliberate, steady stride, suggesting purpose rather than a casual walk. When he passes the truck, he doesn't just walk by it; he briefly places his left hand on its rusty fender for balance as he navigates the uneven path. The description of him smashing the crate is good, but \"downward strike using his right foot\" could be more dynamically described as a powerful stomp, as he raises his knee high before bringing his foot down forcefully. Lastly, while the crate does release a cloud of dust, the most visually striking part of the impact is the way the wooden planks explode outwards in a shower of large splinters, an effect the current caption omits.",
