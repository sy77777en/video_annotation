    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features three men, viewed from over the shoulder of the first. This man, occupying the center and right side of the view, is bald with pinkish skin and is seen from the back. He wears a dark mask covering his entire face and a high, weathered white collar over dark armor. Initially, he looks down at a young, fair-skinned man with short dark hair who is lying on his back in the first man's arms with his eyes closed, wearing dark armor. The perspective then reveals a third man standing opposite the first. This standing man is middle-aged with short, gray hair, a graying beard and mustache, and a serious expression. He is dressed in elaborate white and gold armor with glowing white lights on the shoulders and chest, featuring two slender lights above the blue section of the armor on both sides, worn over a dark uniform.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately lists the sequence of events but focuses too heavily on technical camera movements rather than the subjects' actions, which should be the primary focus. The description of the interaction between the first two men is vague; \"lying motionless in the arms of another man\" could be improved by describing the specific posture, such as \"a man cradles the limp body of another in a pieta-like pose,\" which better illustrates their physical relationship and the lack of motion. Furthermore, the caption separates the camera's action from the subject's action, making them feel like two independent events. For instance, the man turning his head and the camera tilting up to reveal the third man are described sequentially but should be integrated, as the camera's movement likely follows the character's gaze. A better description would be: \"The man cradling the body slowly turns his head to look forward, and the camera tilts up with his gaze to reveal a third man standing perfectly still and facing them.\" This approach connects the subject's motivation to the cinematography, creating a more cohesive and motion-focused narrative.",
