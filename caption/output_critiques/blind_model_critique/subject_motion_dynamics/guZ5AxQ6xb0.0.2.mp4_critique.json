    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man is captured in mid-air while riding a dark-colored motocross bike with a white rear fender. He is wearing a white and blue helmet with goggles that have a white frame and black lenses, a long-sleeved blue and white jersey, and white boots. The man is seated on the bike, which is tilted with its rear wheel elevated. Below the airborne rider and bike, their shadow is visible on the ground.**",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is too static and focuses more on the cinematic effect of slow motion rather than the rider's actual physical actions. It describes the rider as \"suspended,\" which fails to capture the dynamic trajectory of the jump. A more effective caption would describe the motion chronologically. For instance, the video likely shows the rider launching from a dirt ramp, arcing upwards over the track, reaching the apex of the jump where the bike might be tilted sideways in a \"whip\" maneuver, and then beginning the descent. The current caption's phrase \"slow forward movement\" is vague and doesn't specify this arc. It also misses key details about the rider's and the bike's orientation, such as the rider leaning back or the wheels spinning and kicking up residual dirt, which would add crucial information about the motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a thrilling motocross jump, starting with the rider launching off a dirt ramp. As the bike arcs upwards, the rider leans back, executing a stylish \"whip\" maneuver with the bike tilted sideways. The wheels spin rapidly, kicking up dirt as the rider reaches the apex of the jump. The clip then follows the descent, showcasing the dynamic motion and skillful control of the rider as they prepare to land back on the track.",
