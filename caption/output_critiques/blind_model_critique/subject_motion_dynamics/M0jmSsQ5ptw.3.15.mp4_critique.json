    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A tall wooden table is positioned in the foreground, with a blue and silver Red Bull can sitting on a block of ice, flanked by two yellow ice axes stuck into the tabletop. In the middle ground, a helicopter features a prominent white, yellow, and red Red Bull graffiti logo, along with extensive black and white graffiti patterns. A man with light skin, wearing a light beige jacket and black pants, a grey beanie, and blue goggles pushed up on his forehead, runs into the scene. He picks up the can and, holding a black and white snowboard with the Red Bull logo in his right hand, runs toward the helicopter.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main sequence of events but misses several key details and contains a likely chronological error. The description that the man is \"holding a snowboard\" while running toward the helicopter is ambiguous; it's more probable that he picks up the snowboard, which is leaning against the table, *after* grabbing the Red Bull can. The current phrasing makes it sound as if he was holding the board the entire time, which would be awkward. Furthermore, the caption omits the crucial product interaction: after picking up the can, the man cracks it open and takes a quick drink before turning to leave. The description of the helicopter could also be more specific, as its rotors are not just spinning but are at full speed, kicking up a significant cloud of snow from the ground. Finally, the caption ends as the man runs toward the helicopter but fails to mention that he reaches the open side door and begins to climb inside as the video ends, which completes the action.",
