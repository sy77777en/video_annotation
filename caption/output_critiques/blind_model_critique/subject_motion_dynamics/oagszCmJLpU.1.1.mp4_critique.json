  "generated_critique": "The provided caption correctly identifies the subject as a time-lapse of a storm cloud over a prairie, but it fails to adhere to the core instruction of describing the subject's motion in chronological detail. Instead of focusing on action, the caption dedicates most of its length to static visual aesthetics (\"dramatic contrast,\" \"deep blue sky,\" \"bright white,\" \"golden-brown landscape\") and abstract interpretations (\"powerful and dynamic nature\"), which are explicitly discouraged. The description of motion is limited to the generic phrase \"forming and moving.\" A more effective caption would detail the specific sequence of events in the time-lapse. For instance, it could describe how the cloud initially materializes as small puffs that rapidly billow upward and expand outward, churning and darkening at the base as the storm intensifies. It could also describe the cloud's lateral movement across the frame and the corresponding motion of its large shadow sweeping across the prairie landscape, which are key motion elements in such a video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This time-lapse video captures the formation and movement of a massive storm cloud over a vast prairie. Initially, small puffs of cloud materialize and rapidly billow upward, expanding outward as they churn and darken at the base, signaling the storm's intensification. The cloud moves laterally across the frame, casting a large shadow that sweeps across the golden-brown landscape, highlighting the dynamic progression of the weather system.",
