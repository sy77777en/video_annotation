    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A person is shown in mid-air during a skydive, viewed from both in front and from above. They are wearing a light blue long-sleeved top over a darker collared shirt, dark pants, and dark gloves. On their head is a light blue helmet and a pair of goggles. A dark parachute pack is strapped to their back, and a watch is on their left wrist. The person holds their body in a stable freefall position with their arms outstretched to the sides, falling towards a city below.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly follows a chronological order and identifies a change in perspective, it lacks specificity and feels incomplete. The description \"begins the descent\" is vague; the video likely shows the more dynamic action of the skydiver exiting the aircraft, which should be the starting point. The term \"vertical free-fall posture\" is also ambiguous and could be improved by describing the specific orientation, such as transitioning into an upright, seated position (a sit-fly) or pivoting into a head-first dive. Furthermore, after the cut to the high-angle shot, the caption merely states he \"continu[es] to descend,\" which misses a critical action. In this second shot, the skydiver likely spreads his arms and legs again to flatten his body, an essential maneuver to slow down and stabilize before deploying his parachute. The description ends abruptly without mentioning the parachute deployment, which is the logical and climactic conclusion to the freefall sequence and would provide a more complete narrative of the subject's motion.",
