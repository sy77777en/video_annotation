    "pre_caption": "An older man briefly leans his upper body out from a doorway on the left before retracting. A Black person then emerges from a different doorway on the left, walks down the corridor toward the camera, and exits through another doorway on the left. Subsequently, the older man fully exits his doorway and walks down the aisle, followed closely by a woman. The man then exits through a doorway on the left, while the woman continues walking forward. Finally, another man appears from behind a corner on the left and begins walking behind the woman.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins in an empty train car, with natural light from the windows fluctuating between dim and bright as the train moves in and out of tunnels, while the ceiling lights remain consistently on. An older Asian man with glasses, graying hair, a dark blue suit, a white shirt, and a tie with a tie clip briefly peeks his head and shoulders out from a doorway on the left. Following this, a Black person wearing a light pink, textured, oversized sweater with light-colored pants, a headband, white plush slippers, and white plush headphones around her neck emerges from a room and walks toward the camera before exiting to the left. Subsequently, the man who previously peeked out completely exits the doorway and walks down the aisle toward the camera. Walking behind him is a woman with dark hair pulled back, wearing a gray and dark brown patterned poncho over a light-colored hoodie and blue jeans. They both continue walking forward, and the man also exits to the left. Near the end of the video, another man with a black head covering and a black beard appears behind the woman with dark hair pulled back, emerging from the corner between the left doorways.**",

  "generated_critique": "The chronological description of the older man's actions is confusing, as the caption states he \"steps out directly\" at the beginning but then \"fully exits his doorway\" later on, which implies he went back in between actions. It would be clearer to describe him stepping out and pausing before he begins walking down the hall. The path of the second person is also spatially unclear; stating they walk \"toward the camera, and exits on the left\" is contradictory. A more accurate description might be that the person walks down the corridor, passing the camera on its left side before exiting the frame. The caption uses \"corridor\" and \"aisle\" interchangeably, which creates inconsistency; using a single term would improve clarity. Additionally, the relationships between subjects are vague; \"followed closely\" could be specified to clarify if the man and woman are walking together as a pair, and \"walking behind the woman\" could be detailed to indicate if the final man is intentionally following her or just coincidentally heading in the same direction.",

A Black person emerges from a different doorway on the left, walks down the corridor, passing the camera on its left side, and exits the frame. The older man then walks down the corridor, closely accompanied by a woman, and exits through a doorway on the left. The woman continues walking forward. Finally, another man appears from behind a corner on the left and begins walking in the same direction as the woman, seemingly coincidentally.",
