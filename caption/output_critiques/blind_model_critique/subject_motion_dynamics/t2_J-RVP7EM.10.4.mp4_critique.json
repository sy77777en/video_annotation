    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In this black and white, abstract animation styled like an engraving, two tall, slender figures stand in the foreground on the center-right. They are depicted as black-and-white silhouettes wearing long, flowing robes and are positioned on a formation resembling clouds with a horizontal stripe texture. These two figures are facing away from the viewer, looking towards a brightly glowing, canyon-like chasm in the background. Within this luminous chasm, a large multitude of smaller, indistinct, glowing white figures, also seemingly robed, are visible, appearing to be on a long pathway that recedes into the bright distance, raising their arms. As the camera moves, the two tall, slender figures shift to the right.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the following imagined video content:\n*The video opens on a grand, cavernous space. In the foreground, two very tall figures in dark, heavy robes stand with their backs mostly to the camera, looking out over a vast, glowing chasm of shimmering blue and white light. In the distance, on the other side of the chasm, hundreds of smaller, humanoid figures stand with their arms raised in a gesture of worship or surrender. These smaller figures emit a soft, constant white light. The camera then begins a slow, smooth tracking shot to the left. As it moves, the foreground figures remain perfectly still, but the parallax effect causes them to move across the frame from a center-right position to the far-right edge. One of the robed figures subtly tilts its head downwards as it nears the edge of the frame. The background figures remain completely motionless, their collective glow unwavering.*\n\n***\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the subjects and the relative motion caused by the camera movement, it frames the action from the camera's perspective (\"The camera trucks...\") rather than focusing on the subjects' motion as instructed. The description of the foreground figures \"drifting\" is a passive consequence of the camera's action, but it misses an opportunity to describe their own state or subtle movements. For instance, the figures could be described as standing perfectly still, which is an action in itself, and you could add a detail like one of them slightly tilting its head during the pan. Furthermore, the description of the background figures as \"glowing\" is a static quality; a more detailed motion description would specify the nature of this glow—for example, whether it pulses, flickers, or remains constant and steady. A more effective caption would describe the subjects' actions first (e.g., \"Two tall, robed figures stand motionless...\") and then describe their change in position relative to the frame as a secondary detail of the scene's progression.",
