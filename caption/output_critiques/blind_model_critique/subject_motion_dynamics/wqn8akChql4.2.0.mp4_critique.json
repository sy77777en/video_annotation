    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video centers on a white man with short, slicked-back blond hair and a light-colored beard. He is wearing a light brown, long-sleeved tunic with dark lacing on the shoulders over a white undershirt. Initially, only his back is visible, but as the camera arcs clockwise around him, his tense, sweaty face is revealed while he breathes heavily. In the dusty midground, other men become visible. One is a muscular, bald, and shirtless white man wearing dark pants and a wide, dark leather corset around his waist. Another man, also bald and with tattoos on his left arm, stands nearby wearing a dark, sleeveless tunic. Other indistinct figures are scattered in the background, some of whom appear to be lying on the ground.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject and follows a chronological order of his actions, the description of motion is too general and lacks specificity. The phrase \"breathing heavily\" could be improved by describing the physical manifestation of this action, such as \"his chest heaves\" or \"his shoulders rise and fall with each breath.\" Similarly, \"stands mostly still\" is vague; a more precise description of his posture, such as \"stands hunched over with his hands on his knees\" or \"sways slightly from exhaustion,\" would provide a clearer visual. The head turns are listed, but their quality is missing; describing them as \"slowly turns his head\" or \"wearily scans his surroundings\" would add important context. Finally, the description of the background individuals as having \"minimal movement\" is imprecise. It would be more informative to describe their specific state, for instance, \"other individuals lie motionless on the dusty ground or stand with their heads bowed,\" which paints a much more vivid and concrete picture of the scene without resorting to speculation.",

As the camera circles, he slowly turns his head to his left, wearily scanning his surroundings. In the dusty background, other individuals lie motionless on the ground or stand with their heads bowed, adding to the somber atmosphere of the scene.",
