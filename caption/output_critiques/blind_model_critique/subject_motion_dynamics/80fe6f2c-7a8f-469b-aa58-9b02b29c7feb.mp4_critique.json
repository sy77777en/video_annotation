    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle perspective, the lower legs and feet of a person in white athletic shoes run along a track at night.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A level-angle, motion-blurred shot follows the lower legs and feet of a person as they run. The individual, whose other characteristics are obscured, is wearing white athletic shoes. Their feet are shown in motion, repeatedly making contact with a reddish-brown running track marked with white lines.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subject and the basic action of running, it lacks the specific detail that a close-up, motion-focused video like this would provide. The description of the motion as feet \"continuously lift off... and strike it again\" is too generic for what is likely a detailed shot of running biomechanics; it could specify the nature of the foot strike, such as the foot landing on the midfoot before the heel makes contact and then rolling forward to push off from the toes. The caption also misses potential environmental interactions; for instance, the video might clearly show the rubberized track surface compressing slightly under the impact of each footfall, or the shoes kicking up small black granules from the track. Finally, the term \"rapid\" is vague and could be improved by describing the rhythm and power of the stride, clarifying whether it's a consistent, driving pace or an all-out sprint, which would be evident in the muscle flexion of the calves and the speed of the turnover.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a low-angle perspective, the lower legs and feet of a person in white athletic shoes run along a track at night, showcasing the intricate biomechanics of their stride. The feet land on the midfoot before the heel makes contact, rolling forward to push off from the toes with each step. The rubberized track surface compresses slightly under the impact, and small black granules are kicked up with every footfall. The stride is powerful and rhythmic, with visible muscle flexion in the calves, indicating a consistent, driving pace as they propel forward past the white lane lines.",
