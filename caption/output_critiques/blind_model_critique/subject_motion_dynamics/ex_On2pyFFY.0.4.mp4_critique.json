    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a large, crowded concert hall with tiered seating, two men move quickly through the audience. The first man, who appears to be in pursuit, is dressed in all-black tactical gear, including a helmet and a large backpack, and is hunched over as he navigates the rows. The second man, who is following the first, wears a dark suit and is also bent low, moving swiftly over the seats. As he moves, a small cloud of white smoke or dust erupts near him. The audience, composed of numerous light-skinned men and women in casual and formal attire, remains seated in the brown theater chairs, largely facing the stage where a full orchestra is visible in the background, though out of focus.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the chronological order of events but could be more specific in its description of the motion. The initial phrase \"move through the audience\" is too general; a more descriptive verb like \"scramble\" or \"force their way\" would better capture the disruptive nature of their movement. The description of both men \"climbing\" is repetitive and could be nuanced; for instance, the man in tactical gear might vault over the seats with practiced efficiency, while the man in the suit appears to struggle to keep pace. The source of the \"puff of white smoke\" is vague; if the video shows it originating from the floor or a specific object, the caption should state that to provide more clarity (e.g., \"a puff of smoke erupts from the floor near his feet\"). Lastly, while the audience and orchestra \"largely remain seated,\" the caption misses the subtle secondary motion of heads turning towards the commotion and a few musicians pausing, which would add a layer of realism to the scene's description.",
