    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle perspective inside a cylindrical lattice cage, two motorcyclists continuously ride in circles along the interior wall.

The entire scene, including the cage and its occupants, slowly rotates counter-clockwise.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a worm's eye view, the scene captures a cylindrical cage made from a silver-colored metal lattice. Inside, three figures are present: one person is standing and dancing, while the other two are riding motorcycles. The individual closest to the camera on the left is standing inside the cage, with dark skin, wearing ripped camouflage pants, a dark purple long-sleeved jacket, a green inner layer, black sunglasses, a thick necklace, and black and white Nike sneakers. Further up inside the cage, one person rides a blue motorcycle, and another rides a dark-colored motorcycle. Both riders are wearing helmets. Several bright white lights are positioned outside the top of the cage, illuminating the scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively establishes the unique low-angle perspective and identifies the key subjects, but it could be more specific about the nature of their movements. The description of the motorcyclists riding \"in circles\" is too general for what is likely a highly coordinated stunt. The video probably shows them riding in opposing directions on parallel tracks or executing near-miss crisscross patterns to create suspense, details which are central to the action but are missing from the caption. Furthermore, the description of the person in the foreground who \"moves rhythmically to the music\" is interpretive and assumes the presence of music. A more objective and descriptive alternative would be to detail their specific physical actions, such as \"pumps their fists\" or \"gestures toward the riders.\" While the caption correctly notes the camera's rotation and its effect on the scene, it fails to describe how this rotation interacts with the motorcyclists' high-speed movement, which is a key component of the visual experience for the viewer.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a low-angle perspective inside a cylindrical lattice cage, two motorcyclists perform a highly coordinated stunt, riding in opposing directions on parallel tracks along the interior wall, creating suspense with near-miss crisscross patterns. Below them, a person in camouflage pants stands on the side of the cage, energetically pumping their fists and gesturing toward the riders. The entire scene, including the cage and its occupants, slowly rotates counter-clockwise, enhancing the dynamic visual experience as the motorcyclists' high-speed movements contrast with the steady rotation.",
