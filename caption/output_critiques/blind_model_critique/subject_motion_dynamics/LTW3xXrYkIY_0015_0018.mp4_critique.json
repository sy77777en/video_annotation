    "pre_caption": "The man in the fedora, positioned centrally, first points his right index finger upward while extending his left arm out to the side. He then brings both arms down and spreads them wide, moving his body energetically as if dancing. Simultaneously, a man in a black t-shirt moves from behind the central figure to the left side of the frame, laughing, before exiting the shot. On the far left, a man in a baseball cap, who is initially bent over, straightens up. To the right, a man in a blue t-shirt smiles and turns his body slightly toward the main subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject of the video is a light-skinned man with a short beard, wearing a tan fedora and a black t-shirt with a white logo that reads \"Dilla Donuts.\" He is centrally located, gesturing with his arms and has an open-mouthed expression. Three other men are positioned around him. Initially to the right rear side of the main subject is a younger, light-skinned man with short brown hair in a black t-shirt, who also has his mouth open. As the video progresses, he moves toward the left side of the frame and eventually exits from the left. To the right, a man with short dark hair and glasses wears a blue t-shirt and is smiling. On the left, a man with a beard, glasses, and a purple and grey baseball cap is seen in a white t-shirt, initially bent over before straightening up.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption successfully outlines the chronological actions of the central figure and identifies the movements of the other subjects, it could be improved by replacing vague and speculative descriptions with more concrete details. The phrase \"strikes a few poses\" is ambiguous; it would be more informative to describe the poses, such as \"he freezes with one knee bent and both index fingers pointing at the camera.\" Similarly, \"moves his body energetically as if dancing\" and \"giving the impression of dancing\" should be replaced with direct descriptions of the motion, for example, \"shuffles his feet and sways his hips to a rhythm\" and \"repeatedly squats and stands in time with the central figure's movements.\" The description of the man in the blue t-shirt \"continuously twisting\" could be more specific, such as \"pivots his torso from left to right while walking forward.\" Lastly, the interaction could be clarified; instead of just stating the man in the black t-shirt is \"laughing,\" the caption could note that he \"laughs while looking directly at the man in the fedora,\" which would better establish the relationship between the subjects.",
