  "generated_critique": "This caption is too focused on describing the static scenery and the emotional tone of the video, using subjective words like \"peaceful,\" \"calm,\" and \"tranquil,\" which violates the core instructions. The description of the subject's motion, \"a person... is seen walking,\" is overly generic and lacks the required specificity and chronological detail. For example, the video might show the person entering the frame from the left, pushing the stroller along the winding path, pausing to point out a feature of the garden to the stroller's occupant, and then continuing until they exit the frame on the right. A more effective caption would omit the scenic details and instead describe the specific sequence of actions, such as: \"A person pushing a stroller enters the frame from the left, walks along a stone path, briefly stops and gestures toward the surrounding trees, and then continues walking until they exit the frame on the right.\" This focuses purely on the observable, chronological motion as instructed.",
