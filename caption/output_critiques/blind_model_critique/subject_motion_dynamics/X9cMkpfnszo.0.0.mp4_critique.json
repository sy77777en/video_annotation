The central figure, dressed in black, walks forward, while the men in grey jumpsuits surrounding him jog, dance, and gesture in unison.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption successfully identifies the distinct groups of dancers but fails to describe their movements in a clear chronological order as instructed. It presents the actions of the central trio, the surrounding group, and the men on the car as simultaneous, static events rather than a developing sequence. The description of the motion is also too generic; \"hopping away\" could be more specific, such as \"performing a synchronized backward shuffle,\" and \"dancing and making gestures\" could be detailed as \"executing sharp, rhythmic arm movements in place.\" The caption also misses the dynamic relationship between the groups; for example, it doesn't clarify if the surrounding dancers' gestures are directed toward the central trio to frame their retreat. Lastly, the description for the men on the car is vague and should specify if they are performing the same upper-body choreography as the other dancers or a distinct set of moves.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The performance begins with a central figure dressed in black stepping forward confidently, while the surrounding group of men in grey jumpsuits initiates a synchronized backward shuffle, framing the central figure's movement. As the central figure retreats, the surrounding dancers execute sharp, rhythmic arm movements, directing their gestures toward the central trio to emphasize their retreat. Meanwhile, some men positioned on the hood and trunk of a red car mirror the upper-body choreography of the surrounding group, adding a dynamic layer to the performance as the entire ensemble progresses forward in unison.",
