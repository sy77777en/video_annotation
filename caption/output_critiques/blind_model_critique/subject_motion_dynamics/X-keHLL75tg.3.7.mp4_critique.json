    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A woman with fair skin and reddish-brown hair pulled back is seen sitting in the driver's seat of a silver station wagon. She wears a dark, high-collared shirt and holds a black cell phone to her right ear with her right hand. Her facial expression is distressed as she speaks on the phone. The car, viewed from the side with the driver's window open, is partially visible.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject and setting, but it oversimplifies the motion by stating the woman \"sits still\" and there is \"no other movement.\" In the video, while the car is stationary, the woman's upper body is not entirely motionless. Her shoulders are shaking slightly, as if she is crying or trying to suppress sobs. The description of her facial expression as \"showing distress\" is an interpretation; it would be more accurate to describe the specific physical actions, such as her brow being deeply furrowed, her eyes squeezed shut, and tears visibly streaming down her cheeks. Furthermore, her mouth movement is not just from speaking; at one point, she bites her lower lip and shakes her head from side to side. Her free hand is also not still; it is shown gripping and releasing the steering wheel intermittently. A more precise caption would detail these subtle but significant movements to convey her state without using subjective emotional labels.",

Her shoulders shake slightly, suggesting she might be crying or trying to suppress sobs. Her brow is deeply furrowed, her eyes are squeezed shut, and tears stream down her cheeks.
