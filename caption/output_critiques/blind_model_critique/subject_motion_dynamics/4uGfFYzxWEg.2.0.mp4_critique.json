    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two white, featureless humanoid figures in the foreground, positioned as if they are watching a bank of television monitors. The figure on the left is seen from the back of the head and shoulders, while the one on the right is holding something resembling a telephone to its ear with its left hand. The monitors in the background all display scenes from the game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\". The central screen, which is the main focus, shows a medium close-up of a fair-skinned male contestant with short brown hair and a receding hairline. He wears a light blue polo shirt with a dark collar, one pink sleeve, and one white sleeve, and is seen smiling thoughtfully. Other screens show different angles of the same contestant, as well as an older, fair-skinned male host with light-colored hair, dressed in a suit and tie. As the camera moves closer to the screens, the foreground figures gradually move out of the frame.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the following imagined video content:\n*A smooth, continuous dolly shot moves forward down a dark corridor. On either side of the foreground are two static, white, mannequin-like figures. The camera moves past them, so they slide out of the frame. The end of the corridor is a wall of nine television screens, all showing a brightly lit game show. The screens are not perfectly synchronized. Some show a wide shot of the host and contestant, while others show close-ups of their faces. The host is seen speaking animatedly into a microphone. The contestant, a woman, is seen laughing and then her expression changes to one of concentration as she looks up. The screens then flicker and change; some now show a text-based question, while others show a spinning wheel graphic.*\n\n***\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the primary camera motion and the subjects involved, it lacks specificity regarding the most dynamic actions in the video. The description of the camera's movement as \"moves forward\" is generic; a more precise term like \"glides smoothly\" would better capture the continuous, steady nature of the shot. The caption states the humanoid figures are \"pushed out of the frame,\" which is a passive description; clarifying that they are static figures that the camera moves past would be more accurate. The most significant weakness is the vague description of the action on the television monitors. Instead of a general summary like \"engage in conversation,\" the caption should describe the specific, observable, and chronological actions. For instance, it could detail how the host gestures with a microphone, the contestant laughs and then adopts a pensive expression, and how the images on the various screens then simultaneously flicker and switch to display a question graphic and a spinning wheel. This would provide a much clearer and more informative account of the subject's motion as it unfolds on the screens, which is the central activity in the scene.",
