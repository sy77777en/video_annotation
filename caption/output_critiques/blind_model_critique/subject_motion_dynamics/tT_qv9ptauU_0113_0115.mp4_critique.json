    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows two men in a close-up conversation. On the right, a man with a fair complexion, dark, short, curly hair, and a clean-shaven face wears a red polo shirt. He is shown in profile, facing left. On the left, a man with a fair complexion, shaggy, wavy blond hair, and a clean-shaven face wears a dark blue collared shirt. He faces the other man. In the background, visible through a doorway, a blonde woman in a pink top is standing, and two women can be faintly seen sitting on a sofa. A man in a yellow sweater and light-colored pants stands near another man in a dark blazer.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subjects, their positions, and the static camera, it describes their actions in overly simplistic and passive terms. The phrase \"moves his mouth to speak\" is too literal and misses the opportunity to describe more specific, observable motions like changes in facial expression, hand gestures for emphasis, or shifts in posture as the man talks. Similarly, stating the blond-haired man \"remains relatively still\" is vague; a more informative description would note specific listening behaviors, such as nodding in understanding, tilting his head, or making brief eye contact shifts. The caption describes two separate states rather than a dynamic interaction. It could be improved by detailing the back-and-forth nature of the conversation, even if non-verbal, such as describing how the listener's nod directly follows a point made by the speaker, which would better capture the motion and relationship between the two central subjects.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera pans slightly to the left, shifting the view of a man with dark hair on the right from a profile to a more frontal angle as he begins to speak, his eyebrows raising and hands gesturing to emphasize his points. He faces a man with blond hair on the left, who listens intently, nodding in understanding and occasionally tilting his head or making brief eye contact shifts in response to the speaker's words. In the out-of-focus background, several people stand and talk with minimal movement, providing a subtle backdrop to the dynamic interaction between the two central figures.",
