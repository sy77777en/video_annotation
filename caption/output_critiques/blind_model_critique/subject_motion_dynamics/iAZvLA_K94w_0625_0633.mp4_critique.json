    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a black and white, high-angle shot, a paved ground is shown littered with light-colored rubble and numerous dark, crumpled objects. As the camera tilts down, it reveals a small, light-colored car in the foreground. The car is completely overturned, with its roof oriented to the left of the frame and the undercarriage to the right. The dark interior seats are visible through the open window frames of the vehicle, which is surrounded by the same debris seen across the rest of the area.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows. While the caption correctly identifies the initial camera tilt and the stationary nature of the overturned car, it lacks specificity regarding the motion of the surrounding environment. The phrase \"slight movement\" for the rubble is too vague; it would be more informative to describe *what* is moving and *how*. For instance, if the video shows dust and small pieces of paper being stirred by a light wind or water dripping from the car's undercarriage causing pebbles to shift, these specific actions should be mentioned. Furthermore, the description of the car as purely \"stationary\" might overlook subtle but important motions. If smoke or steam is visibly rising from the engine or if a fluid is leaking from the chassis onto the pavement, these details are crucial to describing the complete state of the scene. The caption should precisely describe these secondary movements to provide a more complete and accurate picture of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera tilts down over a debris-covered paved area, revealing a stationary, overturned car in the foreground. While the car remains largely motionless, wisps of smoke rise from the engine, and a slow drip of fluid from the chassis creates small ripples in a puddle below. Around the car, a light wind stirs dust and small pieces of paper, while occasional pebbles shift slightly, adding subtle motion to the otherwise still scene.",
