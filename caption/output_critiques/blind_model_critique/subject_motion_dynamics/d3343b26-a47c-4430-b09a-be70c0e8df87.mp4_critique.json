    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a body of blue-lit water, a person with dark, curly hair is seen both underwater and at the surface. A woman with light-colored, straight hair and a light skin tone sits on the edge of the water, wearing a dark swimsuit. She leans forward, smiling down at the person in the water. The woman's feet, which have red-painted toenails, are visible submerged in the water.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows:\n\nThe caption accurately follows the chronological order of events, but it could be more specific about the nature of the movements. For instance, \"the person surfaces\" is a bit general; the video might show the person emerging slowly and calmly, with water cascading off their shoulders, or they might burst through the surface more energetically. The description of the interaction—\"leans forward\" and \"looks up\"—is a good start, but it lacks a concluding action. In the video I'm imagining, the woman on the edge of the pool extends her hand, and the person in the water grasps it, adding a more definitive interaction that the caption misses. Additionally, the phrase \"The view then shifts above the water\" describes the cinematography rather than the subject's action. It would be more effective to describe this as a continuous motion of the subject, such as \"the person rises through the water to break the surface,\" which keeps the focus on the subject's movement as instructed.",

The person looks up at her, and she extends her hand, which the person in the water grasps, completing their interaction.",
