    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a first-person perspective, a right hand wearing a blue glove with a white circular logo on the back appears above the clear ocean water, with the index finger pointing forward. The hand exits the frame before the view transitions to an underwater scene, revealing a rocky and uneven ocean floor. The seabed is covered with dense patches of green and brown algae and seaweed. Sunlight filters through the clear water from the surface above. Towards the end of the video, the left hand, also gloved, partially enters the view.**",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a good chronological summary, but it misses some key dynamic details that would make the description more vivid and accurate to the visual experience. The initial action of the \"gloved hand\" could be more specific; for instance, the video might show the hand making a clear \"go-ahead\" or \"dive here\" signal rather than just pointing. The description of the submerging action is too simplistic; it omits the visually impactful moment of the camera breaking the water's surface, which likely involves a brief flurry of bubbles and a dramatic shift in light and color. Furthermore, the underwater sequence is described too generally. \"Gliding over a rocky and algae-covered ocean floor\" is a good start, but the video probably shows more specific interactions with the environment. For example, the camera might navigate through a narrow channel between two large boulders or dip lower to inspect a particular patch of kelp swaying in the current. The caption also fails to mention the presence of any marine life, such as small silver fish that dart away as the camera approaches, which would be a salient part of the motion in such a scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person perspective, a gloved hand makes a decisive \"dive here\" signal above the ocean surface before being lowered out of the frame. The camera then dramatically breaks through the water's surface, creating a flurry of bubbles and a striking shift in light and color. As it submerges, the view glides forward over a rocky and algae-covered ocean floor, navigating through a narrow channel between two large boulders. The camera dips lower to inspect a vibrant patch of kelp swaying in the current, while small silver fish dart away, adding dynamic motion to the underwater scene.",
