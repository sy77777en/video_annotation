    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the camera's slow zoom-out and the general setting, it lacks specificity regarding the subjects' actions, making the scene feel more static than it likely is. The description \"several people walk across the scene\" is too generic; the video probably shows a clear distinction between uniformed waitstaff purposefully navigating between tables with trays and patrons walking to or from their seats. Furthermore, characterizing the diners' activity as just \"subtle movements\" undersells the dynamic nature of a restaurant. A more accurate description would capture specific, observable interactions visible from the top-down view, such as groups gesturing animatedly, a waiter pouring wine for a couple, or people at a large table passing shared dishes. The caption could be improved by first establishing the initial close-up, perhaps on a single table's meal, and then describing how the zoom-out reveals the coordinated, bustling activity of the entire patio, highlighting the distinct patterns of movement between the service staff and the socializing diners.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up of a single table's meal, capturing the vibrant colors and textures of the dishes. As the camera slowly zooms out, the scene expands to reveal a bustling outdoor restaurant patio at night. Uniformed waitstaff navigate purposefully between tables, balancing trays with practiced ease, while patrons move to and from their seats. Diners engage in lively conversations, with groups gesturing animatedly and a waiter pouring wine for a couple. At a large table, people pass shared dishes, adding to the dynamic atmosphere. The coordinated movements of the staff and the social interactions of the diners create a lively and engaging scene.",
