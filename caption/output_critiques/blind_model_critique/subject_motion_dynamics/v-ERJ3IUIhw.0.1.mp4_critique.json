    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video features a blue pencil sketch animation that begins with a character appearing as a crab before transforming into a heavyset man with short dark hair, wearing a short-sleeved shirt. The animation captures him in a dynamic pose, initially raising his right arm and then lowering it, while his left hand consistently holds a wok. In the final pose, he faces forward with a neutral expression, holding the wok in his left hand and stirring its contents with a slotted spatula in his right hand.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the central transformation from a crab to a man and the final cooking action, but it could be more specific about the sequence and nature of the animation. The term \"morphing\" is a bit general; the video likely shows a more distinct sequence, such as the crab's shell first rounding and expanding into a torso before the legs retract and the pincers reshape into arms. The description of the right arm simply \"lowering\" is an oversimplification; the animation probably depicts the pincer simultaneously lowering and reshaping into a hand that then grasps the spatula. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention how the wok and spatula appear—they are likely sketched into existence as the corresponding hands are formed, which is a key detail of the animation's style. Finally, clarifying the final action, for instance, by stating that the man makes a continuous stirring motion in the wok, would provide a more precise description of the animation's concluding movement rather than just stating he is \"actively\" stirring.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A blue pencil sketch animation intricately depicts a character transforming from a crab-like shape into a heavyset man. The sequence begins with the crab's shell rounding and expanding into a torso, while the legs retract and the pincers reshape into arms. As the right pincer lowers, it simultaneously morphs into a hand that grasps a slotted spatula. Meanwhile, the wok and spatula are sketched into existence as the hands form. The animation concludes with the man facing forward, making a continuous stirring motion in the wok with the spatula in his right hand.",
