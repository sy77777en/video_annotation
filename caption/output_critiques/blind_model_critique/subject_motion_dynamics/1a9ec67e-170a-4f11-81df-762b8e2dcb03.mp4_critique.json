    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video reveals a woman underwater through a submerging shot that begins with a split-level view of the water's surface and the dark depths below. Initially, the woman is a silhouette, but as the viewpoint goes fully underwater, she is seen more clearly. The woman has light skin and brown hair that floats freely around her head. She is wearing an orange bikini top paired with a white tulle skirt on the lower part of her body and is in a reclined position with her knees bent, surrounded by rising air bubbles in the deep blue water.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the chronological sequence, starting with the camera's submersion and then describing the person's actions. However, the description of the subject's motion lacks specificity. The phrase \"moves them downward in a sweeping motion\" is ambiguous; in the video, the person's hands are actually moving in a continuous, horizontal figure-eight pattern beside their hips—a sculling motion used for buoyancy, not a downward pull for propulsion. Similarly, \"legs alternate between straightening and bending\" could be more precise. The video clearly shows a slow, steady flutter kick, and identifying it as such would be more informative. The caption describes the components of the movement but misses the overall purpose, which is to maintain a static, reclined float just beneath the surface, rather than to travel through the water. Adding the specific terms for these swimming techniques would provide a much clearer and more accurate depiction of the subject's skilled and controlled movements.",
