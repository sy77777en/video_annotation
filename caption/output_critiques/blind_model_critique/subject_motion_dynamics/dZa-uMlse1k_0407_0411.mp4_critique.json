The pole then breaks the surface, lifting the fish completely out of the sea and into the air. Finally, the pole is held steady above the rippling water, displaying the catch against the sky and a distant shoreline.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A small, silvery-white fish with dark vertical stripes and bright yellow fins is impaled on the tip of a long, black spearfishing pole. The video shows the speared fish underwater in turquoise water and then lifted completely out of the water into the air.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly outlines the chronological sequence of events, it misses some key dynamic details that are likely central to the video's visual impact. The initial description of the fish as simply \"impaled\" is too static; in the underwater shot, the fish is probably still alive, writhing and struggling on the spear's tip as it's reeled steadily upward, a crucial element of motion that is omitted. The transition of \"breaking the surface\" could be more descriptive, as the video likely features a dramatic splash and water sheeting off the fish's scales as it's lifted into the air. Finally, stating the pole \"is held steady\" is passive; the action is more likely a deliberate, triumphant gesture, with the pole being raised high to present the catch, not just hold it. The caption also fails to mention the likely first-person perspective of the shot, which is a significant contextual detail for this type of action footage.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins underwater, capturing the intense struggle of a fish writhing and twisting on the tip of a spearfishing pole. As the pole is steadily reeled upward, the fish's frantic movements create a dynamic scene. Breaking the surface with a dramatic splash, water cascades off the fish's shimmering scales as it is lifted into the air. In a triumphant gesture, the pole is raised high, showcasing the catch against the backdrop of the sky and a distant shoreline. The first-person perspective immerses viewers in the action, enhancing the visual impact of this exhilarating moment.",
