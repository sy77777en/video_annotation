    "pre_caption": "This shot begins from a high, ground-level angle. The camera then tilts up and moves forward and to the right, transitioning to a low, hip-level perspective to track a female runner from her rear-side as she starts her sprint. The smooth tracking shot continues forward and to the right, concluding with a slight counterclockwise arc. A shallow depth of field keeps the runner in the foreground in focus, and she becomes larger in the frame as the camera follows her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a ground level and then moves to a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera starts from looking down at the track, then tilts up while moving forward and to the right, focusing on a runner about to start. As she begins her run, the camera continues moving forward and to the right, ending with a slight counterclockwise arc.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the rear-side. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the shot beginning from a \"high-angle, ground-level perspective\" is contradictory; a camera at ground level looking up at a subject is a *low-angle* shot, which seems more plausible for capturing the start of a sprint. The caption could be improved by stating it begins with a *low-angle, ground-level shot*. The description of the focus change is also questionable; a brief, deliberate shift to *deep focus* mid-movement is technically unusual and visually jarring. It's more likely the video features a *rack focus* that smoothly shifts the shallow depth of field from the track markings in the foreground to the runner as she moves into the midground, without ever achieving full deep focus. Furthermore, the statement that the runner is \"becoming larger in the frame\" while being tracked needs clarification. For this to happen as she sprints away, the camera must be moving *faster* than her and closing the distance, a crucial detail about the movement's speed and purpose that is currently missing. Finally, the movement could be described more precisely: the transition from \"ground-level\" to \"hip-level\" is a *pedestal up* movement, and the combined \"forward and to the right\" motion is a diagonal dolly. Specifying these technical terms would add precision and clarity to the caption.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The shot begins with a low-angle, ground-level perspective. The camera then tilts up and performs a pedestal up movement, transitioning to a low, hip-level perspective to track a female runner from her rear-side as she starts her sprint. The smooth diagonal dolly continues forward and to the right, concluding with a slight counterclockwise arc. A rack focus smoothly shifts the shallow depth of field from the track markings in the foreground to the runner as she moves into the midground, keeping her in focus. As the camera moves faster than the runner, it closes the distance, making her appear larger in the frame.",
