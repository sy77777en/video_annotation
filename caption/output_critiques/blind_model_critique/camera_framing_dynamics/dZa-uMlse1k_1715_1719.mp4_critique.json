    "pre_caption": "This first-person perspective shot begins underwater at a level angle, moving forward and upward until it breaks the surface. The camera then adopts a low angle, looking toward a distant island, and makes a slight pan to the right. The footage is slightly unsteady and exhibits mild barrel distortion. A deep focus is used, keeping both the underwater and above-water elements sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion where lines near the frame edges bow slightly outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts underwater and then moves above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera represents the diver’s first-person perspective, moving forward and upward from underwater until reaching the surface, then making a slight pan to the right at the end.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a good foundation, it misses several opportunities to add precision and descriptive detail that would better reflect the visual experience. The description of the initial movement as \"moving forward and upward\" is functionally correct, but could be more technically specific by stating it's a \"smooth dolly forward combined with a pedestal up, simulating the natural bobbing motion of a swimmer.\" The most dramatic moment of the shot—breaking the surface—is glossed over; a more evocative description would mention the brief, split-level view as the lens emerges and the subsequent clearing of water droplets. The caption correctly identifies the shift to a low angle but fails to specify the camera height, which transitions from underwater to a very low water-level position. Furthermore, while \"deep focus\" is likely accurate for an action camera, the description could be enhanced by specifying *what* is kept in focus, such as \"A deep depth of field renders both the water droplets on the lens in the immediate foreground and the distant island in the background with equal sharpness.\" Finally, the \"slight pan to the right\" could be qualified with its speed (e.g., \"a slow, deliberate pan\"), and the purpose of the overall movement—to reveal the island and transition the viewer from an underwater to a surface perspective—is a key contextual element that is currently missing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a first-person perspective shot underwater, featuring a smooth dolly forward combined with a pedestal up, simulating the natural bobbing motion of a swimmer. As the camera breaks the surface, it offers a brief, split-level view, capturing the moment water droplets clear from the lens. The camera then transitions to a very low water-level position, adopting a low angle that looks toward a distant island. A deep depth of field keeps both the water droplets on the lens in the immediate foreground and the distant island in the background sharp. The footage includes a slow, deliberate pan to the right, revealing the island and transitioning the viewer from an underwater to a surface perspective. The shot is slightly unsteady and exhibits mild barrel distortion, enhancing the immersive experience.",
