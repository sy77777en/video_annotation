    "pre_caption": "This smoothly filmed clip uses a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion. The camera begins at a low, eye-level angle, tracking the Hulk as he jumps by moving slowly backward and tilting up. As he lands, the camera quickly tilts down and pans left, transitioning to a level, ground-level perspective to continue following him. The entire scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping all elements sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The video shows a speed ramp effect, where playback speed changes between faster and slower rates.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an eye level (above the waist) and then moves to a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a low angle (looking up from below) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks the Hulk's movement, slowly moving backward throughout while slightly tilting up as Hulk jumps into the air. It then quickly tilts down and pans left to continue tracking him.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject by tilting. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the speed ramp and general camera path, it misses key specifics that define the shot's impact. The speed ramp isn't just between \"slow and regular\"; the video likely uses dramatic slow-motion as the Hulk reaches the apex of his jump to emphasize his power and hang-time, before snapping back to regular speed for the impactful landing. The initial \"eye-level from a low angle\" is contradictory; the shot is more accurately described as starting at a very low, near-worm's-eye angle to exaggerate the Hulk's scale. Furthermore, the movement isn't just a simple backward track and tilt; it feels more like a crane shot, arcing slightly upward and backward to maintain a dynamic composition. The caption also omits the subtle, realistic camera shake upon his initial launch and a more significant, jarring shake upon landing, which are crucial for selling the immense force of his movements. The most significant inaccuracy is the claim of \"deep focus.\" The video clearly employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus tightly tracked on the Hulk while beautifully blurring the chaotic background of destroyed buildings and the foreground debris, which isolates him as the central subject and enhances the cinematic quality of the shot. Finally, the use of a wide-angle lens is apparent from the slight barrel distortion at the edges of the frame, a detail not mentioned in the caption.",
