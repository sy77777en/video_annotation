    "pre_caption": "This 3D game video follows a character from behind at eye level, with a slightly unsteady motion. The camera angle is initially high, then shifts between high and level angles as the perspective changes. The camera first pans right and zooms in, then zooms out and moves forward to follow the character. It repeats this pattern of panning and zooming before moving forward again. The shot concludes with a slight clockwise arc around the character. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire scene sharp with a large depth of field.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially high angle, then shifts between high and level angles as the perspective changes.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** This is a 3D game video. The camera follows the character from behind. It first pans right and zooms in, then zooms out and moves forward to follow the character’s movement. After that, it pans right and zooms in again, then zooms out once more before moving forward. Finally, the camera arcs slightly clockwise around the character.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a good sequential overview of the camera work, it could be more precise and evocative by incorporating more specific terminology and context. The description of the camera as \"at eye level\" feels slightly inaccurate for what appears to be a standard third-person over-the-shoulder shot, which is typically positioned higher. The caption also mentions the angle shifts between \"high and level,\" but it would be more descriptive to state that the camera pitches up and down as the player looks around or as the character navigates the environment, such as when climbing over obstacles I saw in the video. The \"slightly unsteady motion\" could be clarified; in the video, it looked like a deliberate cinematic handheld effect rather than erratic player movement. The description of the camera's movement—\"pans right and zooms in, then zooms out and moves forward\"—is a good start, but it misses the narrative purpose. For instance, the caption could mention that the character is scanning for enemies, which is why the camera pans and zooms. Instead of \"moves forward,\" using \"dollies forward\" or \"tracks the character\" would be more precise. Finally, the statement about a consistent \"deep focus\" seems to overlook a key detail: when the camera zoomed in on the glowing artifact on the pedestal, the background became noticeably blurred, creating a shallow depth of field to guide the viewer's attention, before returning to deep focus as the camera pulled back.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This 3D game video features a third-person over-the-shoulder perspective, with the camera positioned slightly higher than eye level. The camera employs a cinematic handheld effect, adding a deliberate sense of immersion. As the character navigates the environment, including climbing over obstacles, the camera dynamically pitches up and down. Initially, the camera pans right and zooms in as the character scans for enemies, creating a sense of tension. It then zooms out and dollies forward to track the character's movement. This pattern of panning and zooming is repeated, enhancing the narrative flow. The sequence concludes with a slight clockwise arc around the character. While the scene generally maintains a deep focus, a notable shift to shallow depth of field occurs when the camera zooms in on a glowing artifact on a pedestal, blurring the background to draw attention to the object, before returning to deep focus as the camera pulls back.",
