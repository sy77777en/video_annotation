    "pre_caption": "Shot from a slightly unsteady, eye-level, low-angle perspective, the video maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera quickly zooms in on a window-like geometric shape on the second floor of the house, panning slightly to the right with noticeable shakes.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The video captures a house with a garden. The camera focuses on a window-like geometric shape on the second floor of the house, zooms in quickly, and pans slightly to the right with noticeable shakes.\n\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the primary camera movements, it could be more precise and detailed. The phrase “deep focus with a large depth of field” is redundant; simply stating “deep focus” is more concise. The description of the perspective as both “eye-level” and “low-angle” is slightly contradictory; it would be clearer to state it's a low-angle shot captured from a handheld, eye-level height, pointing up at the house. The caption misses an opportunity to specify the nature of the “quick zoom”—an optical zoom would maintain clarity, whereas a digital zoom would likely cause the “geometric shape” to become pixelated upon magnification, a key visual detail. Furthermore, while it mentions the camera is “slightly unsteady” with “noticeable shakes,” it could clarify that this is consistent handheld motion that becomes more pronounced during the rapid zoom and pan, rather than two separate qualities. It is also unlikely that a deep focus would be perfectly maintained during such a fast zoom; a more accurate description might note that the focus softens momentarily or that the camera briefly hunts for focus on the window before settling. Lastly, adding the purpose of the movement—to isolate and emphasize the architectural detail—would provide valuable context.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Captured from a handheld, low-angle perspective at eye-level, the video features deep focus. The camera performs a quick optical zoom on a window-like geometric shape on the second floor of the house, panning slightly to the right. The handheld motion is consistently unsteady, with noticeable shakes that become more pronounced during the rapid zoom and pan. The focus softens momentarily as the camera briefly hunts for clarity on the window before settling. This movement serves to isolate and emphasize the architectural detail.",
