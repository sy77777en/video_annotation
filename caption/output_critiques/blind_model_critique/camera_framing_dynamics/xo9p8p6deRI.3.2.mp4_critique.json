    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera starts at a high angle, looking down at a bed with three paper sheets. It tilts up and pans right as one of the sheets magically lifts into the air, positioning itself parallel to the screen while staying in the frame center.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption has a few points of contradiction and could be more precise in its description. The phrase \"high angle shot filmed at eye level\" is confusing; a shot is either high-angle (looking down) or eye-level (looking straight ahead). Based on the context of looking down at a bed, it's likely a high-angle shot, and the camera's height might be at the eye level of a standing person, which should be clarified. The description of the camera movement as a \"tilt up and pan right\" is mechanically correct, but it would be more descriptive to classify its purpose as a *tracking shot* that follows the subject. The most significant point of contention is the claim of \"deep focus with a large depth of field.\" For a scene involving a \"magically\" glowing letter, a director would more likely use a *shallow depth of field* to isolate the letter, blurring the mundane background of the bed and room to enhance the magical effect and guide the viewer's attention. A deep focus would keep the ordinary surroundings as sharp as the magical subject, potentially undermining the intended atmosphere. Furthermore, the caption could be improved by specifying the steadiness of the shot (e.g., \"perfectly steady,\" suggesting a tripod or gimbal), the speed of the camera movement (e.g., \"a slow, deliberate track\"), and the initial and final framing (e.g., starting as a medium shot and ending in a close-up on the glowing letter).",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera, positioned at a high angle from the eye level of a standing person, looks down at three paper sheets on a bed. As one sheet magically lifts into the air, the camera executes a slow, deliberate tracking shot, smoothly tilting up and panning right to follow the now-glowing letter, keeping it centered in the frame. The shot is perfectly steady, likely using a tripod or gimbal, and transitions from a medium shot to a close-up on the glowing letter. The scene employs a shallow depth of field to blur the background, enhancing the magical effect and focusing the viewer's attention on the letter.",
