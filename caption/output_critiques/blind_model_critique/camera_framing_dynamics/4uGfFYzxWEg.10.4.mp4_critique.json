    "pre_caption": "This high-angle shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire stylized scene sharp. The camera begins stationary, focused on a polygonal man on a red cube, before smoothly dollying forward and trucking right to reveal an adjacent scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** Due to insufficient background information, it is difficult to determine the camera height.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** With limited background, the camera seems stationary at first, focusing on a standing man, before moving forward and rightward to another subject.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the high-angle perspective, deep focus, and the fundamental camera movement, it oversimplifies the action and misses key stylistic details that are likely present in such a video. The movement described as \"dollying forward and trucking right\" would almost certainly be accompanied by a smooth **pan right** to re-center the composition on the adjacent scene once it's revealed. The caption also fails to mention that as the camera moves, the **high angle** might transition into a more **level angle** to frame the new subject more directly. Given the \"stylized\" and \"polygonal\" aesthetic, it's highly probable that a wide-angle lens is used, which would introduce noticeable **barrel distortion**, causing straight lines at the edges of the frame to bow outwards, a detail the caption omits. Furthermore, the statement that the shot \"maintains a deep focus\" might be inaccurate; a more effective shot would likely transition to a **shallow depth of field** once the camera settles on the second scene, blurring the original man and cube in the background to clearly direct the viewer's attention to the new point of interest. Finally, the caption makes no mention of video speed, whereas a stylized world like this could easily feature background elements, like animated particles or clouds, moving in **time-lapse** to create a dynamic contrast with the smooth, real-time camera motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This high-angle shot begins with a deep focus, capturing the entire stylized scene with sharp clarity. The camera starts stationary, centered on a polygonal man standing on a red cube. As it smoothly dollies forward and trucks right, it incorporates a gentle pan right to re-center the composition on an adjacent scene. During this movement, the high angle transitions to a more level angle, framing the new subject directly. The use of a wide-angle lens introduces noticeable barrel distortion, causing straight lines at the edges of the frame to bow outwards. As the camera settles on the second scene, the focus shifts to a shallow depth of field, blurring the original man and cube in the background to emphasize the new point of interest. Additionally, the stylized world features background elements, such as animated particles or clouds, moving in time-lapse, creating a dynamic contrast with the smooth, real-time camera motion.",
