    "pre_caption": "This slow-motion video, shot with mild barrel distortion, uses a smooth, front-facing selfie camera to lead a snowboarder down a slope. The camera begins at eye-level with a high angle, then moves backward and cranes upward to an overhead level as the snowboarder performs a 360 flip in midair. It then cranes back down to eye-level with a level angle upon landing. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire snowy landscape sharp throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion where lines near the frame edges bow slightly outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** Initially, the camera is at eye level. As he rides up the ramp and launches into the air, it shifts to overhead level, then returns to eye level once he lands after the flip.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The selfie camera moves backward to track the snowboarder performing a 360 flip in midair, shifting up and down during the jump.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively outlines the general action, it lacks precision and misinterprets some key camera movements. The term \"slight fisheye effect\" is contradictory; it would be more accurate to describe it as \"mild wide-angle lens distortion\" or \"barrel distortion,\" which is typical for action cameras and would cause the horizon to curve slightly at the edges of the frame. The description of the camera movement during the 360 flip is the main point of failure. A simple \"pan right, and then pan back left\" fails to capture the rotational dynamics of the trick. Since the camera is on a selfie pole held by the rider, it would execute a 360-degree roll along its axis, perfectly in sync with the snowboarder's flip. This roll is the most dramatic movement in the shot, creating a disorienting and immersive effect where the sky and ground spin around the athlete, and it should be the central focus of the description. This movement would also create a constantly shifting Dutch angle, which is a critical detail that has been omitted. Furthermore, while the focus is described as deep, it's likely that motion blur would affect the spinning background during the flip, while the snowboarder remains relatively sharp, a nuance that could be added. A more accurate description would state that the camera \"performs a rapid 360-degree roll with the snowboarder,\" which better conveys the visual experience of being part of the acrobatic maneuver.",
