    "pre_caption": "This overhead shot, filmed from roughly a second-story height, begins at a high angle looking down at a person on a car. The camera smoothly cranes up in an arc, transitioning to a bird's-eye view and then an upside-down high angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The video also utilizes a speed ramp effect, with the playback speed changing between faster and slower rates.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The video shows a speed ramp effect, where playback speed changes between faster and slower rates.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera starts at a high angle, cranes up to a bird’s-eye angle, and ends at an upside-down high angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is craning up in an arc.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main camera movement and effects, it could be more precise and detailed. The description of the camera angle is slightly redundant, starting with \"overhead shot\" and then clarifying it \"begins at a high angle\"; simply starting with \"The shot begins at a high angle\" would be clearer. The term \"upside-down high angle\" is non-standard and confusing. A more accurate description of the movement would be: \"The camera cranes upward in a continuous vertical arc over the subject, simultaneously tilting down to keep them centered. This motion transitions the framing from a high angle to a direct bird's-eye view, and continues past the zenith until the shot is fully inverted.\" The description of the speed ramp is generic; it would be more informative to specify *when* the speed changes occur, for instance, \"The video employs a speed ramp, accelerating during the initial ascent, slowing down to normal speed for the bird's-eye view, and then speeding up again as the frame inverts.\" Furthermore, the caption misses a few key details. Given the wide perspective, it's likely a wide-angle lens was used, which might introduce slight *barrel distortion* at the edges of the frame, a detail worth noting. Finally, while \"deep focus\" is mentioned, it's plausible that only the subject and the car are perfectly sharp, with the distant background (e.g., city lights or a far-off horizon) exhibiting a slight, soft blur, making the focus *relatively deep* rather than universally sharp.",
