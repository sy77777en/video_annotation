    "pre_caption": "Filmed with an extreme fisheye lens that causes significant visual distortion, this shot begins with the camera at hip level. It smoothly trucks and pans left to track a skateboarder. As the skateboarder jumps, the camera tilts up and then down to follow the action. The camera then lowers to ground level and moves forward with the skateboarder. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp throughout the smooth camera movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video shows extreme fisheye distortion where most lines curve strongly outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera trucks left as it follows a skateboarder. It initially pans left, tilts up then down as the skateboarder jumps, and finally follows the skateboarder forward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject by positioning at the side, panning, and tilting.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the use of an extreme fisheye lens and the fundamental camera movements, it misses several key details that define the shot's character. The most significant omission is the use of slow-motion; the video clearly transitions to slow-motion as the skateboarder launches into the air, emphasizing the rotation of the board and the skater's form, before returning to normal speed upon landing. The claim of \"deep focus\" is also an oversimplification. While the fisheye lens provides a wide depth of field, the focus is clearly locked on the skateboarder, and the distant background buildings are noticeably soft, which directs the viewer's attention. Furthermore, the description of the movement as \"smooth\" is not entirely accurate; the final ground-level tracking shot has a slight, rhythmic bobbing, suggesting the camera operator is also on a skateboard, which adds a raw, immersive energy that \"smooth\" fails to capture. The caption could also be more specific about the purpose of the low angle during the jump, which is clearly intended to make the trick appear higher and more dramatic against the sky. Finally, the description of the initial movement as \"trucks and pans left\" is incomplete; the camera also performs a subtle dolly-out to accommodate the skater entering the frame from the right before beginning the main tracking motion.",
