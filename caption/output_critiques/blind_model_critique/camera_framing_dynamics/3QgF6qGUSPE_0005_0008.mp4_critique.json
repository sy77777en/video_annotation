    "pre_caption": "This slightly unsteady, aerial-level shot leads a man from the front as he falls through the sky. The camera begins at a worm's-eye view looking up at him and moves downward. As the man flips backward, the camera rotates and tilts down, transitioning to a high-angle view of the landscape below. Throughout this motion, the camera rolls, creating a varying Dutch angle, and maintains a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a worm's-eye view angle (looking directly up) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera captures a man falling from the sky. It initially faces upward and moves downward throughout. Midway, as the man flips backward in midair, the camera rotates and tilts downward to reveal the landscape below.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main action and camera roll, it contains some imprecise terminology and misses key details that would likely be present in such a video. The description of the shot as both \"aerial-level\" and beginning with a \"worm's-eye view\" is contradictory; a more accurate description would be an \"extreme low-angle shot relative to the subject,\" which then transitions. The phrase \"leads a man from the front\" is also likely incorrect, as a camera looking up at a subject is positioned below, not in front of, them; \"tracks from below\" would be more precise. The movement is described as \"moves downward\" and \"tilts down,\" which is vague. A more dynamic description, such as \"the camera cranes down in a smooth arc,\" would better capture the complex maneuver required to get from below the subject to above them as they flip. Furthermore, skydiving footage is almost always shot on a wide-angle lens, so the caption should mention the resulting \"barrel distortion,\" which would be especially noticeable as the curved horizon of the Earth comes into view. Finally, the claim of \"deep focus\" might be an overstatement; it's more probable that the shot has a \"large depth of field\" where the subject is sharp and the distant landscape is acceptably, but not perfectly, in focus. The caption also omits video speed—it's plausible the man's backward flip is captured in \"slow-motion\" to emphasize the acrobatic grace of the movement before returning to normal speed as the landscape is revealed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This extreme low-angle shot relative to the subject tracks a man from below as he falls through the sky. The camera cranes down in a smooth arc, transitioning from beneath him to a high-angle view of the landscape as he flips backward. Throughout this motion, the camera rolls, creating a varying Dutch angle, and the wide-angle lens introduces noticeable barrel distortion, especially as the curved horizon of the Earth comes into view. The shot features a large depth of field, keeping the subject sharp while the distant landscape remains acceptably in focus. The man's backward flip is captured in slow-motion, highlighting the acrobatic grace of the movement before the video returns to normal speed as the landscape is revealed.",
