    "pre_caption": "This third-person game perspective shot follows a character from behind at an eye-level, level angle. The camera, which is slightly unsteady, maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.\n\nThe camera initially moves backward and rightward, then pushes forward before stopping. It then quickly zooms in on the collapsed tunnel, slowly pulls back, pans left, and zooms out. Finally, it moves forward toward the tunnel again while panning right, with intermittent quick zoom-in and zoom-out movements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** This is a game perspective. The camera follows the character from behind. It first moves backward and rightward, then moves forward and stops. After that, it quickly zooms in, slowly moves back, pans left, zooms out, and finally moves forward while panning right, with quick zoom-in and zoom-out movements.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the third-person perspective and the sequence of camera actions, it could be more precise and evocative. The description of the camera as \"eye-level, level angle\" might be inaccurate; in many third-person games, the camera is positioned slightly above the character's shoulder, creating a subtle high angle to provide a better view of the environment, which seems likely here as the character approaches a large obstacle like a collapsed tunnel. The claim of a constant \"deep focus\" is questionable; the \"quick zoom-in on the collapsed tunnel\" would almost certainly employ a shallow depth of field, blurring the character in the foreground to draw the viewer's focus specifically to the rubble, a dynamic focus change the caption misses. The description of movement could also be refined by using more technical terms and adding purpose; for instance, \"moves backward and rightward\" could be described as \"trucks right while dollying backward, mimicking player-controlled strafing to assess the situation.\" Furthermore, the final sequence of movements—\"moves forward...while panning right, with intermittent quick zoom-in and zoom-out\"—lacks context; it could be improved by describing it as \"a searching dolly-pan, where the rapid, intermittent zooms suggest the player is actively scanning the tunnel entrance for an alternate route or interactive element.\" Finally, the caption omits potential subtle details common in game cinematography, such as slight barrel distortion at the edges of the frame to simulate a real lens or the \"slightly unsteady\" motion being a deliberate, rhythmic \"breathing effect\" tied to the character's idle animation.",
