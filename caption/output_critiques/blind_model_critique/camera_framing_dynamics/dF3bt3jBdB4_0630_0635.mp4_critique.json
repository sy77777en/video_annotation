    "pre_caption": "This first-person shot, representing a diver's perspective, begins above the water at a level angle with a deep focus. The camera pans right before diving downward into the water, performing a clockwise roll that creates a varying Dutch angle and shifts the view to a high angle looking down. Once submerged, the slightly unsteady camera moves forward toward the seabed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts above water and then moves underwater.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera represents the diver’s first-person perspective and performs a diving motion. It starts above the water surface with a right pan, then moves downward into the water with a clockwise roll, and finally continues and moves forward toward the seabed.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the first-person perspective and the basic sequence of action, it could be more precise and visually descriptive. The initial \"deep focus\" is plausible for a wide-angle lens, but it's highly likely such a lens would also create noticeable *barrel distortion*, causing the horizon to curve slightly, which isn't mentioned. The description of the dive as \"diving downward\" is vague; a more technical description might be a \"sharp downward tilt combined with a forward dolly.\" Furthermore, the caption misses a key opportunity to describe the video speed; the moment of entry into the water is almost certainly captured in *slow-motion* to emphasize the splash and the transition between worlds, before resuming normal speed underwater. The description of focus is also incomplete, as it fails to mention how the visual properties change upon submersion. Underwater, the \"deep focus\" would likely be lost due to water turbidity, creating a hazy effect with a much shorter effective focal distance, shifting the focus plane from the distant horizon to the midground seabed. Finally, while \"slightly unsteady\" is a good descriptor for the underwater movement, specifying the speed—such as a \"slow, drifting dolly forward\"—would better convey the mood of exploration.",
