    "pre_caption": "This static, eye-level shot uses a speed ramp effect, changing between faster and slower playback rates. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field with the focus on the man in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The video shows a speed ramp effect, where playback speed changes between faster and slower rates.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies several key elements like the static camera, eye-level height, and shallow depth of field, it could be significantly improved by providing a more structured and detailed account of the visual events. The description of the speed effects is disjointed; stating that the video \"uses a speed ramp\" and \"also includes a time-reversed effect\" fails to explain how these effects are sequenced. A more effective caption would describe the events chronologically, for example: \"The video begins in slow-motion, then utilizes a speed ramp to transition into an even slower playback rate as the man performs an action, followed by a hard cut to a time-reversed segment showing the action's conclusion undoing itself.\" Furthermore, the term \"static shot\" might be misleading if the time-reversal is presented as a separate clip, even from the same camera setup; it would be more accurate to describe it as a sequence of static shots. The description of the focus, while correctly noting its shallow depth, is too general. It's plausible the focus dynamically tracks a key object during the action—for instance, if the man drops a ball, the focus might follow the ball to the ground and then track it back up during the reversal, a detail this caption omits. Clarifying if the focus remains locked on the man or tracks a moving element would provide a much richer description of the cinematography.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a slow-motion sequence, utilizing a speed ramp to transition into an even slower playback rate as the man in the foreground performs an action. This is followed by a hard cut to a time-reversed segment, where the action's conclusion undoes itself. The sequence consists of static shots from an eye-level perspective, maintaining a shallow depth of field. The focus dynamically tracks key elements, such as a ball dropped by the man, following it to the ground and then back up during the reversal, enhancing the visual storytelling.",
