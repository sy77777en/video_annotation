    "pre_caption": "With a shallow depth of field focused on the midground, the camera smoothly ascends while tilting downward, gradually revealing more of an investigation board with pinned notes and red string.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** Due to insufficient background information, it is difficult to determine the camera height.\n\n**Camera Angle:** Due to insufficient background information, it is difficult to determine the camera angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera ascends while tilting downward, gradually revealing more of the investigation board.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the shallow depth of field and the primary camera movements (ascending, tilting, trucking), it lacks the specificity needed to fully reconstruct the shot. The description of the movement is too general; \"ascends\" could be a simple pedestal up, but combined with a downward tilt, it more accurately describes a \"crane up\" movement, which has an inherent arc. The caption also fails to establish the initial and final framing, which is critical for a reveal shot. For example, the video likely starts with a tight close-up on a single clue on the board before the camera pulls back, but the caption only describes the movement itself. Furthermore, it mentions the *action* of tilting but not the resulting camera *angle*; the shot probably transitions from a level angle to a high angle, offering a commanding, omniscient view of the investigation, a key narrative detail that is omitted. The focus is described as being on the midground, but it doesn't clarify if this focus is actively maintained or tracked throughout the complex camera move, which would be a significant technical feat. Finally, adding a descriptor for the pace, such as \"slowly\" or \"deliberately,\" would better convey the suspenseful mood that this type of shot is designed to create.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera executes a crane up movement, starting with a tight close-up on a single clue on the investigation board. As it ascends with a deliberate pace, the camera tilts downward, transitioning from a level angle to a high angle, gradually revealing more of the board with pinned notes and red string. The focus is actively maintained on the midground, enhancing the suspenseful mood as the shot shifts to an omniscient view of the investigation.",
