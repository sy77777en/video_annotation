    "pre_caption": "This is an unsteady, aerial-level shot of a simulated airport. The camera begins at a level angle and moves forward, getting closer to the ground. It shifts to a high angle, tilts up slightly, and then returns to an almost level angle. After the first four seconds, the camera pans left to track a landing airplane. Most of the simulated scene remains clear, while the runway appears somewhat blurry against a dark, uninformative background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera begins at a level angle, shifts into a high angle, then slightly tilts up, returning to almost a level angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The scene is a simulated airport view. Most of the scene remains clear, while the runway appears somewhat blurry. The background is dark and lacks information, making it difficult to determine the overall camera focus type.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, positioned at a high angle, moves forward to get closer to the ground throughout the video. After the first four seconds, it begins tracking an airplane landing at the airport by panning left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subject and the basic camera trajectory, it could be more precise and detailed according to the instructions. The description of the initial camera position as an \"aerial-level shot\" at a \"level angle\" is contradictory; an aerial shot looking at the ground is inherently a high-angle or bird's-eye view. A more accurate description might be that the video begins with a high-angle aerial shot that cranes downward, increasing the angle's severity. The term \"unsteady\" is too general; it would be better to specify the nature of the movement, such as \"a slight, continuous digital jitter\" or \"moderate, simulated handheld shaking.\" The description of the focus is also ambiguous. Stating the \"runway appears somewhat blurry\" doesn't clarify if this is due to motion blur from the camera's forward movement or a shallow depth of field effect. A better caption would specify this, for example: \"The shot uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the midground airplane in sharp focus while the foreground runway and distant, dark background are softly blurred.\" Finally, while the caption notes the camera pans to track the airplane, it could describe the quality of this movement—for instance, whether the pan is smooth and perfectly centered on the aircraft or if it lags slightly, adding to the simulated, imperfect feel of the shot.",
