    "pre_caption": "This video captures a computer-generated simulation of a town from a high, aerial angle. The camera moves forward quickly and smoothly, descending to a lower aerial level. Initially, the entire town is in deep focus. As the camera approaches a specific house, the focus shifts to a shallow depth of field, blurring the surrounding buildings while keeping the target house sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The video shows a computer-generated simulation of a town, with the camera height shifting from a very high aerial level down to a level between overhead and aerial.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video shows a computer-generated simulation of a town, initially in deep focus. As the camera approaches a house, the focus shifts to a shallow depth of field, keeping the house in the foreground clear while the midground and background become blurred.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera captures a house from an aerial high angle, quickly moving forward to get closer.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic camera motion and the shift in focus, it lacks the technical specificity and detail suggested by the instructions. The description of movement as \"moves forward... descending\" is too general; the video clearly shows a complex, single-take motion combining a fast dolly forward with a simultaneous crane down. Furthermore, the movement isn't a straight line but a gentle counter-clockwise arc that helps reveal the target house from behind a cluster of trees. The caption also misses that the video speed isn't constant; it employs a speed ramp, beginning at a moderate pace, accelerating significantly during the mid-flight, and then decelerating smoothly as it nears the house. The initial shot, being a very wide aerial view, exhibits slight barrel distortion at the edges of the frame, which disappears as the camera moves closer. The camera angle also evolves more than described: it starts at a direct bird's-eye angle and then tilts downward into a high angle during the descent. Finally, the change in focus could be more precisely termed a \"smooth rack focus,\" which is initiated during the final deceleration phase, seamlessly transitioning from a deep focus on the entire town to an ultra-shallow depth of field that isolates the target house just as the camera's movement comes to a near-stop.",
