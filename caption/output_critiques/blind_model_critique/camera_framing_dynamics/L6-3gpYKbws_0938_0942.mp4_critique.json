    "pre_caption": "This shot, which exhibits mild barrel distortion, begins with the camera underwater at a high angle, looking down at the rocky bottom with a deep focus. The slightly unsteady camera then moves and tilts upward, emerging from the water to a level angle to reveal the shoreline scenery, before performing a slight pan to the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion where lines near the frame edges bow slightly outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts underwater and then moves above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera starts underwater, looking down at the rocky bottom, it moves upward while tilting up, emerging from the water to reveal the shoreline scenery, and finally performs a slight pan right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively captures the core action, it could be more precise and descriptive. The description of the camera's starting position as \"underwater at a high angle\" is slightly ambiguous; specifying a height like \"just below the water's surface\" would be clearer. Similarly, the final position is described only by its \"level angle,\" but adding the height, such as \"eye-level,\" would better ground the shot. The most significant omission is the change in focus; the caption notes the initial \"deep focus\" but fails to mention the likely rack focus that occurs as the camera emerges, shifting from the underwater rocks to the distant shoreline and creating a shallower depth of field to emphasize the newly revealed landscape. The movement \"moves and tilts upward\" could be more technically defined as \"pedestals and tilts upward.\" Furthermore, this type of reveal is frequently shot in slow-motion to add drama to the water breaking over the lens, a crucial detail that is missing. Lastly, the purpose of the final pan is not mentioned; it might be to reframe the composition to center a key subject on the shoreline, such as a dramatic cliff formation or a distant boat, which would add important narrative context to the camera's movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The shot begins with the camera just below the water's surface at a high angle, looking down at the rocky bottom with deep focus. The slightly unsteady camera then pedestals and tilts upward, emerging from the water in slow-motion to an eye-level angle, revealing the shoreline scenery. As the camera emerges, a rack focus shifts from the underwater rocks to the distant shoreline, creating a shallower depth of field to emphasize the newly revealed landscape. The camera then performs a slight pan to the right, likely to reframe the composition and center a key subject on the shoreline, such as a dramatic cliff formation or a distant boat.",
