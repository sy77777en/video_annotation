    "pre_caption": "This video features a hand holding a panoramic camera, which displays footage of a skier. The camera capturing the skier is positioned at a high angle and roughly eye-level. While the skier on the screen is in deep focus, the main shot has a shallow depth of field, with the camera in hand sharp against a blurred background. The camera on the screen performs unsteady, shaky rear-side tracking, following the skier forward, left, and downward, with slight pans.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The height of the camera capturing the skier on the overlaid screen is roughly at eye level relative to the ground.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The angle of the camera capturing the skier on the overlaid screen is a high angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video shows the skier on the overlaid screen in deep focus, while in the overall frame, the overlaid camera in the foreground is in focus, and the background is blurred.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The video includes an overlay from a panoramic camera, showing a skier on its screen. The camera follows the skier forward, left, and downward, with a slight pan left at the start and again in the middle.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the rear-side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the dual-shot composition and the differing depths of field, but it lacks precision and misses key details. The description of the skier's camera as both \"high angle\" and \"roughly eye-level\" is contradictory; it would be clearer to state it's a high-angle shot captured from a camera on a pole held above and behind the skier. The caption also fails to describe the main camera's configuration, which appears to be a static shot, a crucial detail for a complete description. Furthermore, while it correctly identifies the device as a \"panoramic camera,\" it neglects to mention the characteristic barrel distortion visible in the skier footage, a common trait of the wide-angle lenses on such devices. The description of the inner camera's movement as \"following the skier forward, left, and downward\" is vague; it would be more precise to describe it as \"tracking the skier from a rear-third-person perspective, with unsteady pans to follow their turns down the slope.\" Finally, the caption could better explain that the \"slight pans\" are likely the user digitally reframing the 360-degree footage on the device's screen, which is a primary feature of holding and displaying footage on a panoramic camera in this manner.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a hand holding a panoramic camera, displaying footage of a skier. The skier's footage is captured from a high-angle shot using a camera mounted on a pole held above and behind the skier, resulting in characteristic barrel distortion from the wide-angle lens. The main shot is a static composition with a shallow depth of field, keeping the camera in hand sharp against a blurred background. The skier is tracked from a rear-third-person perspective, with the camera performing unsteady pans to follow their turns down the slope. These pans are likely the result of the user digitally reframing the 360-degree footage on the device's screen, a key feature of panoramic cameras.",
