    "pre_caption": "This is a smooth shot where the camera arcs clockwise around a photograph on a wooden surface, while also moving slightly up and tilting down. The shot begins with a shallow depth of field, keeping the photo in the midground sharp, before transitioning to deep focus. Due to the perspective, the camera's height and angle are ambiguous.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The wooden planks in the photo's background could be either a floor or a wooden wall. Due to insufficient reference information, it is hard to determine the camera height.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The wooden planks in the photo's background could be either a floor or a wooden wall. Due to insufficient reference information, it is hard to determine the camera angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The shot starts with shallow focus, keeping the photo in the midground sharp. As the camera moves, it eventually transitions to deep focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera primarily arcs clockwise around the photo on the table, while moving slightly up and tilting down.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main camera movement as a smooth clockwise arc and notes the change in focus, it could be more precise and confident in its technical descriptions. Stating that the camera's height and angle are \"ambiguous\" is an unnecessary hedge; given the subject is a photograph on a surface, the shot likely begins at a high angle and transitions towards a bird's-eye view as it moves. The description \"moving slightly up and tilting down\" is technically correct but could be more professionally termed a \"slight crane up,\" as this single motion encapsulates both the vertical lift and the corresponding tilt required to keep the subject framed. Furthermore, the caption could quantify the arc (e.g., \"a 90-degree clockwise arc\") to provide a clearer sense of the movement's scale. The transition from shallow to deep focus is well-noted, but it would be more informative to describe *how* it happens—is it a slow, gradual pull that brings the wood grain into focus, or an abrupt snap? Finally, labeling the photo as being in the \"midground\" might be inaccurate; in a close-up shot like this, the photo itself likely constitutes the primary plane of focus, with the wooden surface creating the foreground and background elements that are initially blurred.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera executes a smooth 90-degree clockwise arc around a photograph on a wooden surface, beginning with a high angle and transitioning towards a bird's-eye view. This movement includes a slight crane up, maintaining the photograph as the primary plane of focus. Initially, the shot features a shallow depth of field, with the photo sharply in focus, before gradually transitioning to deep focus, revealing the wood grain in detail. The wooden surface serves as both the foreground and background, initially blurred but becoming clearer as the focus shifts.",
