    "pre_caption": "In this third-person shot from a 3D game, the camera follows a character from behind at eye level as they walk through a subway tunnel. The camera angle shifts between a slight high angle and a level angle. The camera moves forward, first panning left, then trucking slightly left and right before continuing its forward motion with additional pans to the left and right. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking, and a deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle shifts between a slight high angle and a level angle as the perspective tilts.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** This is a 3D game video. The camera follows the character from behind. It first moves forward to follow the character while panning left, then trucks slightly left and right before continuing to move forward and pan left. It then keeps moving forward, with panning to the left and right during the forward motion.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a solid foundation, it could be more precise and evocative by refining its terminology and adding key details. The description of movement as \"panning left, then trucking slightly left and right\" is somewhat clunky; it would be more accurate to state that the camera **tracks** the character's forward and lateral (strafing) movements, while the **pans** are likely player-controlled actions to survey the tunnel. The \"unsteady\" movement could be more specifically described; for instance, is it a deliberate, cinematic \"handheld shake\" to build tension, or is it a rhythmic \"camera bob\" synchronized with the character's footsteps? The caption correctly identifies the \"deep focus,\" but misses an opportunity to describe the visual interplay of light—for example, you could imagine the character is using a flashlight, creating a bright, focused cone of light that moves with the camera's pan, while the rest of the scene, though in focus, is shrouded in atmospheric darkness. Finally, the caption omits that the video is at **regular speed** and doesn't mention the potential for subtle **barrel distortion** at the edges of the frame, a common effect from the wide field-of-view typical in third-person games.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In this third-person shot from a 3D game, the camera tracks a character from behind at eye level as they navigate through a dimly lit subway tunnel. The camera angle alternates between a slight high angle and a level angle, capturing the character's forward and lateral (strafing) movements. Player-controlled pans survey the tunnel, while the camera's movement includes a deliberate, cinematic \"handheld shake\" to build tension. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp, with a bright, focused cone of light from the character's flashlight cutting through the atmospheric darkness. The video plays at regular speed, and subtle barrel distortion at the edges of the frame hints at the wide field-of-view typical in third-person games.",
