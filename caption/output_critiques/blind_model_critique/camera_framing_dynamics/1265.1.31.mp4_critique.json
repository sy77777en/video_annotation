    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video has post-edited trippy visual effects, making it hard to determine the type of camera focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is tilting up and panning right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your feedback is as follows:\n\nThe caption provides a decent starting point but misses several key details that would more accurately describe the imagined scene. The phrase \"eye-level, high-angle perspective\" is confusing; it should be clarified that the camera is held at a standing person's eye-level but is angled downwards to create a high-angle shot of the man on the floor. The caption also fails to mention that the camera angle changes during the movement, shifting from a high angle to a more level angle as it tilts up to view the rest of the room. While the movement \"tilts up and pans right\" is correct, the description lacks purpose and a clear start and end point; for instance, it could specify that the camera moves from a close-up on the man's face to a wider shot revealing a neon-lit, cluttered bedroom, ending on a window. The description of \"trippy visual effects\" is too vague. It would be more informative to specify the nature of these effects, such as \"The image is distorted with heavy chromatic aberration and artificial light trails that smear across the frame during movement.\" This specificity would also strengthen the point about the focus; instead of just saying it's \"difficult to determine,\" you could note that \"while the effects create an ambiguous depth of field, a shallow focus on the man is implied initially before the background elements are revealed.\" Finally, if the visual effects introduce any warping, such as a slight barrel distortion at the edges, this should be noted as a form of lens distortion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera, held at a standing person's eye-level, is angled downwards to create a high-angle shot of a man lying on the floor. As it smoothly tilts up and pans right, the angle shifts from high to more level, moving from a close-up on the man's face to a wider shot that reveals a neon-lit, cluttered bedroom, ending on a window. The video features post-edited effects, including heavy chromatic aberration and artificial light trails that smear across the frame during movement. These effects create an ambiguous depth of field, initially implying a shallow focus on the man before revealing the background elements. Additionally, slight barrel distortion at the edges introduces a form of lens distortion.",
