    "pre_caption": "This video is captured with a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The shot begins from an aerial, high-angle perspective, looking down at a car before a large gate. The camera then executes a smooth, steady forward and downward movement while tilting up, transitioning to an eye-level, level-angle view as it approaches the gate.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an aerial level and then moves to an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera starts from a high angle, steadily moving forward and downward while tilting up to reach a level angle.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a good foundational description of the shot, it lacks the specific terminology and detail requested in the instructions. For instance, the \"forward and downward movement while tilting up\" is a complex motion that could be more precisely described as a single, continuous **crane down and dolly in**, creating a descending arc toward the subject. The caption also misses an opportunity to describe the **speed and purpose** of this movement; imagining the video, this is likely a **slow and deliberate** crane, designed to create a sense of grandeur and reveal the scale of the estate before transitioning the viewer to a more personal, ground-level perspective. Furthermore, a shot like this, likely filmed with a wide-angle drone lens, would almost certainly exhibit **minor barrel distortion**, causing the top of the large gate and any architectural lines in the background to appear slightly curved, an detail that is omitted. Finally, the description of \"deep focus\" could be more nuanced; while the scene is generally sharp, the focus plane is likely set on the car and gate in the midground, and as the camera dollies in, there might be a subtle **focus track** to maintain sharpness on the gate as it becomes the primary subject, a dynamic element not captured by the current static description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video features a deep focus shot, maintaining sharpness across the scene. It begins with an aerial, high-angle view, looking down at a car before a large gate. The camera performs a continuous crane down and dolly in, creating a descending arc toward the subject. This slow and deliberate movement is designed to convey grandeur and reveal the estate's scale, transitioning to a personal, eye-level perspective. Likely filmed with a wide-angle drone lens, the shot exhibits minor barrel distortion, subtly curving the gate's top and background lines. The focus is primarily on the car and gate in the midground, with a possible focus track to keep the gate sharp as it becomes the main subject.",
