    "pre_caption": "From an eye-level perspective, the camera performs a smooth counterclockwise roll. It begins with a 90-degree Dutch angle, briefly straightens to a level angle as a person in the midground performs a breakdance move, and then continues rolling back to a 90-degree tilt. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire group of people sharp throughout the movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The video begins with a 90-degree tilted level angle. As the camera rolls, it transitions to a normal level angle, and finally returns to an almost 90-degree tilted level angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is rolling counterclockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively identifies the core camera roll and its synchronization with the breakdance move, it could be more precise and comprehensive. The \"eye-level\" description feels generic; if the dancer is performing a power move on the floor, the camera is likely closer to a hip or low-level height to properly frame them, even if it's at the eye-level of the surrounding crowd. The description of the roll's conclusion is ambiguous: stating it \"continues rolling back to a 90-degree tilt\" is confusing. A more accurate description for a continuous 180-degree motion would be that it \"continues its counterclockwise roll to an inverted 90-degree Dutch angle.\" Furthermore, the caption only describes rotation, but a shot this dynamic likely involves translational movement as well; for instance, the camera might be performing a slow, subtle counterclockwise arc around the dancer simultaneously with the roll to enhance the feeling of momentum. Finally, to capture a whole group and a central dancer this closely, a wide-angle lens would probably be used, introducing slight barrel distortion that isn't mentioned. The caption also omits video speed, whereas a slight slow-motion effect during the peak of the dance move is a common technique that would be a critical detail to include.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera, positioned at a low-level height to capture the dancer's power move on the floor, performs a smooth counterclockwise roll. It starts at a 90-degree Dutch angle, briefly straightens to a level angle as the dancer in the midground executes a breakdance move, and then continues its roll to an inverted 90-degree Dutch angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire group of people sharp throughout the movement. Simultaneously, the camera executes a subtle counterclockwise arc around the dancer, enhancing the sense of momentum. A wide-angle lens is used, introducing slight barrel distortion, and the video features a slight slow-motion effect during the peak of the dance move to emphasize the action.",
