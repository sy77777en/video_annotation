    "pre_caption": "In this slow-motion shot, the camera starts at a low angle and smoothly tracks a mountain biker by tilting down and panning left. As the biker descends, the camera performs a slight zoom-out and continues its steady leftward pan, shifting to a level angle. A deep focus keeps the entire rocky landscape in clear view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a low angle (looking up from below) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera first tilts down while slightly panning left, then performs a slight zoom out before continuing to pan left steadily.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject while panning and tilting.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the slow-motion effect and the general leftward movement, it contains some inaccuracies and omissions based on the visual information. The description of the camera movement is slightly contradictory; starting at a \"low angle\" looking up at the descending biker would necessitate an initial upward tilt to frame them, followed by a downward tilt as they pass the camera's horizontal axis, not just a simple \"tilting down.\" The term \"tracks\" is also used ambiguously; the camera appears to be on a static tripod, achieving the follow-motion purely through a smooth, continuous pan to the left and a complex tilt, rather than physically moving alongside the subject (trucking). Furthermore, the transition from a low to a level angle isn't just a shift in tilt but is accomplished by the biker riding down the terrain to become parallel with the camera, which remains at a fixed hip-level height. The \"slight zoom-out\" is more of a subtle, continuous adjustment to keep the biker framed as they move away from the camera's initial position. Finally, while the focus is sharp on the biker and the rocky midground, \"deep focus\" is an overstatement, as the distant mountain range in the background is noticeably soft, creating a shallow depth of field that isolates the action rather than keeping the entire landscape in focus. The shot also exhibits minor barrel distortion at the edges, characteristic of a wide-angle lens, which is not mentioned.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In this slow-motion shot, the camera begins at a low angle, initially tilting upward to frame the mountain biker as they descend. As the biker moves past the camera's horizontal axis, the tilt adjusts downward, while a smooth, continuous pan to the left follows their motion. The camera remains stationary at a fixed hip-level height, with the biker's descent creating the transition to a level angle. A subtle, continuous zoom-out keeps the biker centered as they move away. The focus is sharp on the biker and the rocky midground, but the distant mountain range is softly blurred, creating a shallow depth of field that highlights the action. Minor barrel distortion at the edges, typical of a wide-angle lens, adds to the dynamic feel of the shot.",
