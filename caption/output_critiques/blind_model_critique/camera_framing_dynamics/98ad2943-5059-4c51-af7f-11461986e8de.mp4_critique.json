    "pre_caption": "This low-angle, eye-level shot is captured from inside a moving vehicle. The camera moves forward and to the right, exhibiting slight unsteadiness and shaking. A deep focus is employed, keeping both the car's interior and the passing tunnel walls relatively sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward and moving right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the general setting and movement, it could be significantly more precise and evocative. The description of the shot as both \"low-angle\" and \"eye-level\" is contradictory; a more accurate description, assuming the camera is on the dashboard, would be a \"low-angle, dashboard-level shot.\" The description of movement as \"forward and to the right\" is vague. A better caption would specify that the camera is dollying forward as the vehicle navigates a gentle right-hand curve. The caption also misses key visual details that would likely be present in such a video, such as the rhythmic strobing of the tunnel's overhead lights creating a pulsing effect or periodic lens flares. Furthermore, it omits any mention of potential lens distortion; a wide-angle lens, common for such shots, would likely introduce noticeable *barrel distortion*, causing the straight lines of the tunnel walls and ceiling to appear curved. The video speed is also unaddressed; if the tunnel lights and wall textures are blurring past rapidly, it would be crucial to note that this is a *fast-motion* or *time-lapse* shot. Finally, while \"deep focus\" is plausible, specifying the focus plane by mentioning that both the car's A-pillar in the foreground and the distant, bright exit of the tunnel in the background remain in sharp focus would provide a more concrete and comprehensive description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This low-angle, dashboard-level shot is captured from inside a moving vehicle. The camera dollies forward as the vehicle navigates a gentle right-hand curve, exhibiting slight unsteadiness and shaking. The rhythmic strobing of the tunnel's overhead lights creates a pulsing effect, with periodic lens flares adding to the dynamic visual. A wide-angle lens introduces noticeable barrel distortion, causing the straight lines of the tunnel walls and ceiling to appear curved. The fast-motion pace blurs the tunnel lights and wall textures, enhancing the sense of speed. Deep focus is employed, keeping both the car's A-pillar in the foreground and the distant, bright exit of the tunnel in the background in sharp focus.",
