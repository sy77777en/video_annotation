    "pre_caption": "This first-person perspective video, which has mild barrel distortion, captures a cliff dive with smooth camera work. Initially at an eye-level, level angle on the cliff, the camera pans right and moves forward to track a man from behind as he jumps. The perspective then pans left and moves downward in a diving motion, transitioning to an aerial level with a high-angle view and a downward tilt. Before impact, the camera tilts up, and the shot concludes at an underwater level with a worm's-eye angle. A deep focus with a large depth of field is maintained throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion where lines near the frame edges bow slightly outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** It starts at eye level. It shifts to an aerial level as a perspective jump, and then to an underwater level as the perspective moves into the water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially a level angle on a relatively high cliff, then becomes a high-angle as the character jumps from a high place, and then becomes a worm's eye angle after falling into the water.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera represents the diver’s first-person perspective, performing a cliff-diving motion. It begins with a right pan while moving forward to follow another diver ahead. As it nears the cliff edge, the camera pans left, then moves downward with a tilt down as it dives off the cliff. Approaching the water surface, it tilts up while continuing its downward movement.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption accurately outlines the basic sequence of events, but it oversimplifies the experience and misses key dynamic elements that would be prominent in the video. The claim of \"smooth camera work\" is questionable; a first-person perspective of a cliff dive would inherently include naturalistic shakiness from the diver's run-up and a jarring, abrupt jolt upon impact with the water, which your description omits. A crucial missing detail is the likely use of video speed alteration; the freefall portion would almost certainly be in slow-motion to emphasize the height and the diver's form before potentially speed-ramping back to normal speed for the impact. The description of the focus is also too generic. While the aerial view would have a deep depth of field, the underwater conclusion would not be so clear; the impact would create a chaotic, disorienting flurry of bubbles, momentarily obscuring the entire frame before it settles into a murky, less-defined worm's-eye view, possibly with lingering water droplets distorting the lens. Lastly, the camera movement during the dive is more complex than a simple \"pan left and move downward\"; it would follow a distinct parabolic arc, and the \"pan left\" seems arbitrary unless the diver was specifically shown looking at the surrounding cliffs during the fall.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This immersive first-person perspective video captures the exhilarating experience of a cliff dive, complete with the naturalistic shakiness of the diver's run-up and the jarring impact with the water. The video begins at an eye-level angle on the cliff, where the camera dynamically tracks a man from behind as he leaps into the void. As he descends, the camera follows a parabolic arc, capturing the diver's form in slow-motion to emphasize the height and grace of the fall. The perspective shifts to an aerial view with a high-angle, downward tilt, before speed-ramping back to normal speed for the dramatic water impact. Upon hitting the water, the scene becomes a chaotic flurry of bubbles, momentarily obscuring the frame and creating a disorienting effect. As the bubbles settle, the underwater view emerges with a murky, less-defined worm's-eye angle, possibly distorted by lingering water droplets on the lens. The video masterfully balances deep focus during the aerial view with the chaotic, blurred focus underwater, enhancing the dynamic and thrilling nature of the dive.",
