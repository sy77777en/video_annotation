    "pre_caption": "The camera, positioned at a level angle with a varying Dutch angle, begins at hip level. It executes a smooth, slight pan to the left while moving forward. The camera then continues its forward motion while rolling clockwise, eventually flipping to aim at a cross on the wall at approximately eye level. The entire shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** Initially, the camera is at hip level, and by the end, it flips to aim at the cross at approximately eye level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera begins with a slight pan left while moving forward, then continues forward while rolling clockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your feedback is a good start, but it contains a significant contradiction and could be more precise and technically detailed. The caption states the paper is initially blurred, which implies a shallow depth of field, but then incorrectly claims the *entire shot* maintains a deep focus. This is impossible; the focus must be changing. The description of the movement, while capturing the general idea, could be refined using more standard terminology. For instance, \"moves forward\" should be \"dollies forward,\" and \"flipping\" is too informal for the complex \"rolling\" motion described. The caption also omits crucial details like the steadiness and speed of the camera, which are essential for understanding the shot's feel—is it a smooth, stabilized gimbal shot or a shaky, urgent handheld one? Furthermore, the purpose of this complex camera maneuver isn't explained; it seems designed to create a disorienting effect or a creative reveal. A more accurate and informative caption might be: \"The shot begins at eye-level with a shallow depth of field, leaving a paper in the right foreground out of focus. In a single, smooth, and deliberate motion, the camera dollies forward while simultaneously panning left and tilting up. During this movement, it executes a 180-degree clockwise roll, and a rack focus shifts the focus plane from the foreground to the background, bringing a cross on the far wall into sharp focus as the camera settles, now inverted.\"",
