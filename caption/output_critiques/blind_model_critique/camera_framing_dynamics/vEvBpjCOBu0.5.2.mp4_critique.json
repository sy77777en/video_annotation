    "pre_caption": "This level-angle shot begins with the camera focused on a blue and gold cube held in a press. The camera then trucks quickly and smoothly to the left, stopping to reframe on a rusty sphere that has just shattered the cube. The background is too dark to determine the focus type.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The background is too dark to determine the focus type.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The lens first stops at one object and then quickly moves to the left to focus on another object before stopping.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a good foundation by identifying the camera angle and the basic movement, but it misses several key technical details that would be visually prominent in such a video. The most significant omission is the video speed; an event like a sphere shattering a cube would almost certainly be filmed in high-speed and presented in dramatic slow-motion to capture the fragmentation and impact, a detail the caption fails to mention. The description of the focus is also weak; stating the background is \"too dark to determine the focus type\" is an analytical dead-end. Visually, this would manifest as an ultra-shallow depth of field, where the subject is crisply in focus while the background is intentionally rendered as a non-descript, out-of-focus void to isolate the action. Furthermore, the camera movement described as a \"truck\" might be an oversimplification. A more dynamic shot would likely involve a smooth, counter-clockwise arc that pivots around the point of impact, simultaneously tracking the sphere as it emerges from the cube's debris, rather than a simple lateral truck that occurs after the event. Finally, the description could be more precise about camera height (e.g., \"eye-level with the cube\") and should consider potential subtle lens distortion, such as slight barrel distortion that might be visible on the straight edges of the press, which is common in close-up shots.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with an eye-level shot of a blue and gold cube held in a press, captured with an ultra-shallow depth of field that crisply isolates the subject against a blurred, dark background. Filmed in high-speed and presented in dramatic slow-motion, the scene captures the moment a rusty sphere shatters the cube, sending fragments flying. The camera executes a smooth, counter-clockwise arc around the point of impact, dynamically tracking the sphere as it emerges from the debris. Subtle lens effects, such as slight barrel distortion, may be visible on the straight edges of the press, adding to the visual intensity of the close-up shot.",
