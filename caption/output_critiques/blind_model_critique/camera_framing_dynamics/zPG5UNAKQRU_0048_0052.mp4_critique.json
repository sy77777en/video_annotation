    "pre_caption": "This first-person video, shot with a lens causing mild barrel distortion, maintains a deep focus throughout. The camera begins above the water at a level angle, exhibiting noticeable shakiness and a varying Dutch angle. It then moves downward and forward to dive underwater, tilting down to a high-angle perspective and panning slightly left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion where lines near the frame edges bow slightly outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts above water and then moves underwater.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera represents the diver’s first-person perspective. It briefly remains above the water surface with noticeable shakiness, then moves downward and forward to dive underwater, accompanied by a very slight pan to the left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera is stationary.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective, mild barrel distortion, and the general sequence of movement, it lacks crucial details and contains some potentially inaccurate descriptions. The claim of maintaining \"deep focus throughout\" is questionable; as the camera plunges into the water, droplets likely splash across the lens, temporarily obscuring the view, and underwater turbidity would naturally soften and blur distant elements, limiting the effective depth of field, even if the lens is set to infinity. The caption also fails to mention video speed; a shot like this often employs a dramatic speed ramp, slowing the motion as the camera hits the water to emphasize the splash. Furthermore, the description of movement is too simplistic. The initial \"noticeable shakiness\" could be more accurately described as natural, erratic head movements from an eye-level height on a boat deck. The dive itself isn't just a move \"downward and forward\" but a rapid, arcing crane down that follows the subject's jump, and the final \"panning slightly left\" underwater feels unmotivated without mentioning a subject, such as a passing turtle, that the camera is turning to observe. Lastly, describing the underwater view as a \"high-angle perspective\" is correct, but it misses the opportunity to note the dramatic shift in lighting and color palette from the bright, sunlit world above to the muted, cyan-tinted environment below the surface.",
