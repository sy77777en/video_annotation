    "pre_caption": "This is a static shot from a worm's-eye view, looking directly up from what appears to be the bottom of a container. Initially, the container in the foreground is slightly out of focus, while the figures above in the midground and background remain sharp. The shot ends as liquid is poured onto the lens, causing the entire image to go out of focus. The camera height is not determinable from the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** Due to insufficient reference information, it is impossible to determine the camera height.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a worm's-eye view angle (looking directly up).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera is positioned at the bottom of a container, shooting upward from a worm’s eye angle. The container in the foreground is slightly out of focus, while most of the midground and background remain sharp. At the end, pouring liquid onto the lens causes it to go out of focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a good foundation, but it misses several key visual details and contains an inaccuracy. The assertion that the camera height is \"not determinable\" is incorrect; as the camera is placed at the bottom of a container resting on a surface, its height should be defined as *ground-level* or *surface-level*. The description of the ending is also too simplistic. Instead of the image just going \"out of focus,\" a more accurate description would detail the visual effect of the liquid hitting the lens—for instance, the image would likely experience severe *refractive distortion*, with the figures above warping and swirling as the turbulent, possibly bubbly, liquid flows over and obstructs the view. Additionally, the initial focus could be more concisely described as a *shallow depth of field* with the focus plane on the midground figures, rendering the foreground soft. Lastly, the caption fails to mention the inherent *barrel distortion* and slight warping of the background figures, a common effect when shooting upwards through the curved base of a container like a blender carafe or a glass.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a static shot from a worm's-eye view, looking directly up from the bottom of a container resting on a surface, placing the camera at ground-level. The scene features a shallow depth of field, with the focus plane on the midground figures, leaving the foreground slightly soft. The shot captures inherent barrel distortion and slight warping of the background figures, typical when shooting through the curved base of a container like a blender carafe or glass. As the video concludes, liquid is poured onto the lens, causing severe refractive distortion. The figures above warp and swirl as the turbulent, possibly bubbly, liquid flows over and obstructs the view, creating a dynamic visual effect.",
