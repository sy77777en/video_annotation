    "pre_caption": "This unsteady shot begins at a hip-level, worm's-eye view and cranes up in an arc, transitioning to a high-angle perspective from eye level. Throughout the shaky movement, the camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the celebrating group and the falling confetti sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a worm's-eye view angle (looking directly up) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is craning up in an arc.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a good overview of the camera's motion and focus, but it contains some contradictory terminology and misses key details that would make it more precise. The phrase \"hip-level, worm's-eye view\" is confusing, as a worm's-eye angle typically implies a ground-level position looking straight up, whereas hip-level is a specific height. A more accurate description, assuming the camera is held low and tilted up, would be \"a low-angle shot from hip-level.\" Similarly, achieving a \"high-angle perspective from eye level\" is only possible if the subjects are below the camera; for a standing group, the camera would need to move *above* eye level to get a high angle. The term \"cranes up in an arc\" is also ambiguous; it's more likely a compound handheld movement, such as \"pedestaling upward while arcing clockwise.\" Furthermore, the caption omits crucial information. For instance, I imagine the confetti falls gracefully, indicating the video is in *slow-motion*, a vital detail for the viewer. Given it's a group celebration, the shot was likely captured on a wide-angle lens, which would introduce noticeable *barrel distortion* at the edges of the frame. Finally, while \"deep focus\" is noted, it's more probable that the shot has a *moderately deep depth of field* where the celebrating group and confetti are sharp, but the distant background is slightly soft, rather than everything being in perfect focus. A more complete description would specify the speed of the energetic, shaky movement and its purpose: to build excitement by starting low and revealing the full scope of the celebration.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The shot begins with a low-angle view from hip-level, pedestaling upward while arcing clockwise to transition to a high-angle perspective above eye level, capturing the celebrating group below. The camera's energetic, shaky movement is in slow motion, enhancing the excitement as it reveals the full scope of the celebration. A wide-angle lens introduces noticeable barrel distortion at the edges, while a moderately deep depth of field keeps the group and gracefully falling confetti sharp, with the distant background slightly soft.",
