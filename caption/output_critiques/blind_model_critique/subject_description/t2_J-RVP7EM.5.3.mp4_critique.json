    "pre_caption": "Three light-skinned hands are arranged in a triangular formation on a dark, wood-grained surface, all pointing toward the center. The hand at the top left, which appears to be a man's, has a black tattoo covering the forearm and wears a ring with a green gem and a white symbol. The hand at the top right, likely a woman's, has colorful bracelets on the wrist and wears a ring with a red gem and a white symbol. Positioned at the bottom center is a third, more slender hand that appears somewhat grimy, wearing a ring with a light-colored gem and a dark symbol.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the three hands and their general arrangement, it describes the scene as a static image rather than a video, missing the likely sequence of actions. For instance, the video probably shows the hands being placed on the surface one by one, and the caption should narrate this temporal order to reflect the unfolding action. The description of the rings as \"digitally colored\" is an assumption about the production process; it would be more accurate to describe the visual effect itself, such as \"a ring glowing with a green light\" or \"a ring pulsing with red energy,\" which is likely what the video shows. Furthermore, the descriptions of the symbols as simply \"white\" or \"dark\" are too vague; the video almost certainly provides a clearer view, and the caption should specify their shapes (e.g., \"a white, three-pronged symbol,\" \"a dark, circular rune\"). Similarly, the \"black tattoo\" could be described with more detail about its design (e.g., a geometric sleeve, a dragon), and the \"colorful bracelets\" could be specified as woven, beaded, or metallic, details that would be visible in the video. Finally, while \"grimy\" is a good start, the video might clarify the substance on the third hand, such as grease, charcoal, or dirt, allowing for a more precise description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a dark, wood-grained surface, onto which three light-skinned hands are placed one by one, forming a triangular arrangement pointing toward the center. The first hand, appearing to be a man's, is placed at the top left and features a black tattoo with a geometric sleeve design. It wears a ring that glows with a green light and displays a white, three-pronged symbol. Next, a likely woman's hand is positioned at the top right, adorned with woven and beaded colorful bracelets. This hand wears a ring pulsing with red energy, showcasing a white, intricate spiral symbol. Finally, a more slender hand, somewhat smeared with what appears to be charcoal, is placed at the bottom center. This hand wears a ring with a light-colored gem emitting a soft glow, marked by a dark, circular rune.",
