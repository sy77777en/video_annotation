    "pre_caption": "In a wide, high-angle view, a vast expanse of reddish-brown ground is covered by hundreds of men lying in rows. The men, appearing to be soldiers, are dressed in various 19th-century-style uniforms of grey, blue, and brown, with many showing signs of injury like bandages. A few people move among the prone bodies. A woman wearing a long, full-skirted pink dress and a hat walks down a path between the rows of men. Other men, some in uniform and some in civilian clothes, are also seen walking, with a few carrying wooden stretchers.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively establishes the scene's scale and identifies the main subjects, it could be enhanced with more specific visual details that seem likely to be present in such a video. For instance, the description of the men as \"lying in rows\" could be more precise; the video might show them in various postures—some on their backs with arms outstretched, others curled on their sides—with discarded rifles and knapsacks scattered on the dusty ground between them. The woman in the pink dress is a strong focal point, but her actions could be described more factually; instead of just \"walks,\" she might be seen pausing to kneel beside a soldier or carrying a specific object like a water pail or a medical basket, which would add narrative depth. Furthermore, the detail about men carrying \"wooden stretchers\" could be more specific by noting whether the stretchers are empty or are actively being used to transport the injured, a critical distinction. Finally, while the uniforms are correctly identified as 19th-century style, the video likely shows discernible differences between two opposing armies (e.g., blue versus grey coats), and mentioning this would provide important context without adding subjectivity.",
