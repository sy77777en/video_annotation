    "pre_caption": "This video features three human figures rendered in a low-polygon, geometric style, giving them a translucent and glowing appearance against a black background. The figures are all sitting on a white cube-like structure. In the center, a man sits facing forward, wearing a t-shirt with reddish-purple polygons on the shoulders. To his left, another man, rendered entirely in a translucent white-blue hue, sits in profile with one knee raised. To the right and slightly behind the central figure, a woman sits with her legs crossed, wearing a reddish-maroon long-sleeved top.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the three low-polygon figures and their general placement, it misses the dynamic nature of the video and oversimplifies key visual details. The description fails to mention the slow, continuous 360-degree rotation of the camera around the central structure, which reveals different facets of the geometric models over time. The \"glowing appearance\" is more specific; it's a soft, internal light that pulses slowly, causing the translucency of the figures to shimmer and reveal their underlying wireframe structure. The caption describes the central man's \"outfit\" as reddish-purple, but it's more accurate to say his entire form is rendered in a shifting gradient of magenta and violet. The man on the left is not just in profile; his body faces left, but his head is turned slightly to look towards the viewer. Furthermore, the woman's pose is more specific than \"one leg lifted\"; her right ankle is resting on her left knee, and her top isn't just reddish-maroon but has a subtle, reflective quality that catches the light differently from the other figures. Finally, the \"white cube-like structure\" is actually a set of three stacked, slightly offset rectangular blocks with a non-reflective, matte finish, creating a stark contrast with the luminous figures seated upon them.",
