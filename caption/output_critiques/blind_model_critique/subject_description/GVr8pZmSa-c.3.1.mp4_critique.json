The view pans over a dim, indistinct seabed under a vast expanse of deep blue water, with small, light-colored particles resembling marine snow drifting slowly through the frame. A large, shadowy rock formation looms in the background. There is no main subject, as the shot is designed to convey the immense scale and mysterious atmosphere of the deep-sea environment, focusing on the vast, empty space rather than a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as an underwater scenery shot and notes the absence of a main subject, it could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions. The description begins with the introductory phrase \"This is an underwater scenery shot,\" which should be omitted. It also uses the forbidden term \"frame\" when describing the drifting particles. The adjective \"mysterious\" is subjective and conveys an emotion, which the instructions advise against. Furthermore, the description misses key visual details that would likely be present. For instance, in such a dark environment, the illumination would probably come from a distinct light source, like the cone of light from a submersible, which is a significant visual element that goes unmentioned. The description of the seabed as \"dim\" and \"indistinct\" is vague; it could be more specific by describing its texture, such as \"a fine, silty bottom with gentle ripples\" or \"a rocky, uneven floor.\" Similarly, the \"shadowy rock formation\" could be detailed further as \"a craggy, dark grey rock outcropping with sharp, jagged edges.\" The color \"deep blue\" might be inaccurate for the murky depths, where the unlit water would appear black, with the visible color being a direct result of the artificial light source. Finally, the concluding sentence explaining the shot's purpose is slightly verbose and could be condensed for greater impact.",
