    "pre_caption": "An isometric timeline graphic is presented on a dark gray grid. The timeline is shaped like an arrow and is composed of segments that change color from yellow-green at the beginning to orange and then red at the arrowhead. Positioned at the start of the timeline is a 3D, rounded square icon with a light blue background and a white border. Inside the icon is a cartoon cow with black and white spots, set within a circular frame. Below the cow, the words \"Çiftlik BANK\" are written in white. Various white text labels are placed along the timeline, including \"July 31, 2016\" near the start, \"2016,\" \"2017,\" and \"Late 2017\" near the red end. A yellow, triangular warning sign containing a black exclamation mark appears near the arrowhead.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the key graphical elements and their attributes, it fails to capture the dynamic nature of the video, describing it as a static image rather than an animation. The feedback should incorporate the motion and temporal sequence of events. For instance, the timeline likely doesn't just appear but animates onto the screen, perhaps growing from left to right as its segments progressively change color from yellow-green to orange and finally red. The text labels, such as \"July 31, 2016\" and \"2017,\" probably fade or slide into place sequentially as the timeline reaches those points, guiding the viewer through the chronology. The most significant omission is the animation of the yellow warning sign; it likely doesn't just \"appear\" but pops up emphatically near the red arrowhead, possibly with a slight shake or a flashing effect to draw urgent attention to that point in the timeline. Describing this sequence of animations would more accurately reflect the video's content and narrative flow.",
