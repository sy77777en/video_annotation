    "pre_caption": "In the foreground, a person's lower leg and foot, with light-toned skin, are visible, wearing a white sock and a light-colored athletic shoe that is touching a soccer ball. In the midground, several other people are playing. One person wears a dark green short-sleeved shirt and dark shorts. Another player, captured in motion, is dressed in a black short-sleeved shirt, bright orange shorts, and turquoise athletic shoes. A fourth person in a dark shirt can be seen further in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subjects and their general placement, but it could be more specific and dynamic. The description of the foreground subject is too limited; focusing only on the lower leg and foot feels incomplete, as the video likely shows the player's full uniform, which should be described to establish them as the primary subject. The description of the midground players is also slightly confusing and repetitive, mentioning a player in a \"dark green... shirt\" and then \"two individuals in green tops\" separately, when they are likely teammates who could be described collectively for clarity. Furthermore, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the action and interaction. For instance, the foreground player with their foot on the ball might be preparing to pass to the player in orange shorts, who is sprinting to an open position. Describing this relationship would add crucial context. Finally, key objects like the \"light-colored athletic shoe\" and the \"soccer ball\" lack specific detail; describing the shoe's brand or color accents and the ball's pattern would significantly enhance the visual accuracy of the description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In the foreground, a soccer player with light-toned skin is fully visible, wearing a complete uniform consisting of a white jersey, matching shorts, and white socks paired with light-colored athletic shoes featuring blue stripes. Their foot is poised on a black-and-white patterned soccer ball, suggesting they are about to pass it. In the midground, two players in matching dark green jerseys and shorts, likely teammates, are engaged in the game. One of them is sprinting towards an open position, ready to receive a pass. Another player, wearing a black short-sleeved shirt, bright orange shorts, and turquoise athletic shoes, is captured in motion, possibly moving to intercept the ball. Further in the background, a fourth player in a dark shirt is visible, adding depth to the scene. The dynamic interaction between the players highlights the intensity and strategy of the game.",
