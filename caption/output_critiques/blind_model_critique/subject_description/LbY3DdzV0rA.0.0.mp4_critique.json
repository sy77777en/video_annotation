    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a massive dust storm, known as a haboob, as it advances across a desert. The focus is on the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the natural event rather than a specific object. A towering, opaque wall of tan-colored dust dominates the view, rolling over a flat expanse dotted with saguaro cacti and sparse green shrubs. Above this phenomenon, the sky is split between dark, turbulent storm clouds on one side and a patch of clear blue with white clouds on the other, highlighting the storm's leading edge.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively identifies the event as a haboob and correctly follows the instruction for describing a scenery shot, it could better capture the dynamic nature of the video. The description feels more like an analysis of a still photograph rather than a moving scene. For instance, my viewing of the video showed a clear progression where the massive dust wall, initially a distant feature on the horizon, rapidly advances toward the camera, progressively engulfing the landscape. The caption could be improved by describing this temporal change, such as noting how the lighting shifts dramatically from bright sunlight to an ominous, dark orange glow as the storm front passes over. Furthermore, the description of the dust wall as an \"opaque wall\" is a bit simplistic; in the video, the wall had a complex, churning texture with billowing, cauliflower-like formations and smaller dust vortices spinning at its base. Mentioning how the sparse green shrubs and saguaro cacti bend and sway violently in the wind just before being obscured by the dust would also add a more objective sense of the storm's power, replacing subjective terms like \"dramatic\" and \"powerful\" with concrete visual evidence.",
