    "pre_caption": "The video opens on a static, high-angle shot of a vast, green, rolling landscape under a cloudy sky. A person then walks into the frame from the bottom, revealed against the expansive scenery. The figure is clad in a long, light-colored hooded cloak and carries a small bundle in one hand. They proceed to walk along a dirt path that runs alongside a low stone wall winding through the hills.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main action and setting, it could be improved with greater specificity and adherence to the instructions. The use of \"person\" and \"individual\" is vague; given the presence of \"grayish-white facial hair,\" it would be more precise to identify the subject as a man. The description of the facial hair itself is also general; if the video shows a full beard and mustache, the caption should specify that. The caption violates the negative constraint of avoiding the word \"frame.\" A better phrasing would be \"A man appears from the bottom of the scene.\" The description of the \"small package in each hand\" is minimal; imagining they are small, rectangular boxes wrapped in brown paper and tied with twine would add valuable detail. Furthermore, other key visual attributes seem to be omitted. For instance, the man might be wearing a worn, dark green flat cap, and his khaki overalls could be visibly weathered and stained with dirt around the knees. The \"dark long-sleeve shirt\" could be more specifically described as a navy blue thermal shirt. Finally, the term \"dynamic\" is subjective; simply describing the camera's movement as a \"steady backward and upward pull\" would be more objective and descriptive of the visual experience.",
