    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot focuses on the lower half of an older, light-skinned man's face, showing his nose, mouth, and chin. He has a prominent, thick, white mustache that covers his upper lip. His light-skinned hand brings a slice of plain white bread to his mouth, and he takes a bite, with his teeth briefly visible. He then chews with his mouth closed, and the skin around his mouth appears wrinkled.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject and the central action, but it misses several key visual details that would be apparent in such an extreme close-up. The description of the bread as \"plain white bread\" is likely an oversimplification; the video probably shows a more textured slice, perhaps lightly toasted with a defined, darker crust, which isn't mentioned. The man's hand is described minimally, but in a close-up, features like prominent veins, age spots, or even a wedding band would be visible and are important character details that have been omitted. Furthermore, while the mustache is noted, other facial details like the texture of his skin, the presence of light gray stubble on his chin, or the specific shape of his nose are ignored. The action of chewing is described mechanically; the video likely conveys a specific pace or rhythm—for instance, a slow, contemplative chewing motion—that the current description fails to capture, and it only describes a single bite, whereas the video might show a more continuous sequence of eating.",

His skin is textured with light gray stubble on his chin and a defined nose shape. His light-skinned hand, marked with prominent veins and age spots, possibly adorned with a wedding band, brings a slice of lightly toasted bread with a defined, darker crust to his mouth. He takes a bite, revealing his teeth briefly, and then chews slowly and contemplatively, with his mouth closed, as the skin around his mouth appears wrinkled. The sequence captures a continuous, rhythmic motion of eating, emphasizing the details of his facial expressions and the texture of the bread.",
