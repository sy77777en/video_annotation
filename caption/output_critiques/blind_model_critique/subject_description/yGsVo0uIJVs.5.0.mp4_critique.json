    "pre_caption": "A large, white industrial ship is depicted in a foggy, blue-green tinted environment. The vessel has a multi-level superstructure with two prominent, lattice-style crane towers on its top deck. Several red, dome-shaped objects are visible on its various levels, along with a smaller, yellow crane arm on a lower deck. Scaffolding is erected along the side of the ship's hull. White text is overlaid on the scene; in the bottom left corner, it reads \"$350 MILLION\" with \"(IN TODAY'S MONEY)\" underneath, and in the top right corner, it says \"The actual ship looked\".",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject as a large, white industrial ship and notes several specific features like the cranes and red pipes, it describes the scene as if it were a static image rather than a video. My viewing experience included the ship moving slowly from left to right through the calm, blue-green water, creating a subtle wake that is not mentioned. The camera appears to be tracking alongside the vessel in a smooth, continuous shot, which gives a sense of its immense scale and steady progress. The caption also overemphasizes the text overlay while omitting more crucial visual information about the ship's condition and activity. For instance, the video clearly shows small, indistinct figures of workers in yellow hard hats moving along the scaffolding, indicating the ship is actively under construction or repair even while afloat. Mentioning these workers would provide a better sense of scale and context. The description of the text is overly detailed; it could be condensed to simply state that informational text regarding the ship's cost and appearance is present. A more effective caption would incorporate the vessel's movement and the presence of the workers, creating a more dynamic and accurate depiction of the video's content.",
