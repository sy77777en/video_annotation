    "pre_caption": "In a high-contrast, black-and-white scene, a person who appears to be a woman is seated at a desk. Her visible skin, including her face, neck, and arms, is completely covered in a dark, glistening, liquid-like substance. She has short, dark, coiffed hair that is also wet and shiny. Initially seen in profile, she turns her head to face forward, revealing wide, light-colored eyes. Her hand is near the base of a lit banker's lamp on the desk.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption effectively captures the core subject and stark, high-contrast aesthetic of the scene. However, it could be improved with more specific visual details based on the likely content. For instance, instead of the slightly hesitant \"person who appears to be a woman,\" simply stating \"a woman\" would be more direct if her features are indeed discernible despite the substance. The description of the substance itself could be more vivid; imagining the video, the substance appears thick and viscous like oil or tar, clinging to her skin rather than just being \"liquid-like.\" The caption omits any mention of her attire; even if it's also dark and covered, noting a simple dark blouse or a specific neckline would add valuable information. The banker's lamp is a key element, and its description is incomplete. It should be noted that the lamp is on, as it is likely the source of the glistening highlights, and its classic metallic base and dark shade could be mentioned. Finally, the description of her action could be more precise; rather than her hand being \"near the base,\" it might be \"resting on\" or \"touching\" it, and instead of \"withdraws her hand down the desk,\" a more natural phrasing like \"slides her hand away from the lamp\" would better describe the motion.",
