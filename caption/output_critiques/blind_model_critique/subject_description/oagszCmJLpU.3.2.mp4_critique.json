    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a massive, turbulent storm system moving over a flat, rural plain. The video's focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific object. The sky is almost entirely consumed by a colossal supercell cloud, which is dark grey and nearly black at its base, with lighter grey and white layers swirling above. Below this ominous formation, a vast expanse of green and brown farmland with visible crop rows stretches toward a line of low, distant hills silhouetted against a sliver of bright, warm light on the horizon, from which a curtain of rain appears to be falling.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the video as a landscape shot of a storm, it misses key dynamic elements that would be central to such a video. For instance, it describes the supercell's layers as \"swirling\" but fails to mention the distinct, visible rotation of the entire cloud mass, a defining characteristic of a time-lapsed supercell. The caption also omits the likely presence of frequent, silent flashes of in-cloud lightning that would periodically illuminate the storm's structure from within. Furthermore, the description of the \"curtain of rain\" is static; in the video, this rain core is likely seen sweeping across the farmland from one side of the view to the other, and the \"sliver of bright, warm light\" on the horizon probably shifts and fades as the storm progresses. Finally, the caption mentions \"farmland\" but neglects to include a key foreground element I see, a lone, unpaved road that winds through the green and brown fields toward the storm, which serves as a crucial visual anchor that emphasizes the sheer scale of the weather system.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scene featuring a massive, rotating supercell storm system moving over a flat, rural plain. The focus is on the immense scale and dynamic atmosphere of the environment. The sky is dominated by a colossal supercell cloud, with distinct, visible rotation and layers of dark grey and nearly black at its base, swirling with lighter grey and white above. Frequent, silent flashes of in-cloud lightning periodically illuminate the storm's structure from within. Below this ominous formation, a vast expanse of green and brown farmland stretches toward a line of low, distant hills silhouetted against a shifting and fading sliver of bright, warm light on the horizon. A sweeping curtain of rain moves across the farmland, adding to the storm's dynamic presence. In the foreground, a lone, unpaved road winds through the fields toward the storm, serving as a crucial visual anchor that emphasizes the sheer scale of the weather system.",
