    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot capturing a static, detailed view of a magnificent Gothic cathedral's facade. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, showcasing the grandeur of the structure rather than a specific subject. Bathed in the golden light of a low sun, the building's intricate polychrome marble exterior, with its white and green geometric patterns, is thrown into high relief by deep, slowly shifting shadows. The composition highlights rows of sculpted figures standing in ornate, pointed-arch niches, the detailed relief carvings within a large triangular pediment over a portal, and the complex tracery of a large rose window on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the video as an architectural scenery shot, but it could be more precise and evocative. The description of the shot as \"static\" seems to contradict the \"slowly shifting shadows,\" which strongly suggests the video is a time-lapse; clarifying this would better describe the motion. The use of the subjective adjective \"magnificent\" should be avoided in favor of objective details. While the caption mentions key architectural elements, it could be more specific; for example, the \"triangular pediment\" on a Gothic cathedral is more accurately termed a \"gable\" or \"wimperg.\" The description also misses plausible visual details that would enhance it, such as the deep blues and reds of the stained glass visible within the rose window's tracery, or the presence of small, distant people at the base of the structure, which would serve to emphasize its immense scale. Finally, the spatial layout could be clearer; instead of just placing the rose window \"on the right,\" the caption could describe how the central portal and its flanking rows of sculpted figures are arranged in relation to it, providing a more complete compositional map of the facade.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video is a time-lapse capturing the architectural grandeur of a Gothic cathedral's facade. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the structure's impressive scale and intricate details. Bathed in the golden light of a low sun, the building's polychrome marble exterior, with its white and green geometric patterns, is accentuated by deep, slowly shifting shadows. Rows of sculpted figures stand in ornate, pointed-arch niches flanking the central portal, which is crowned by a detailed relief carving within a large gable. The complex tracery of a large rose window, adorned with deep blues and reds of stained glass, is prominently featured to the right of the portal. Small, distant figures at the base of the structure emphasize its immense scale, completing the composition of this breathtaking architectural scene.",
