    "pre_caption": "In the foreground, two men stand facing each other on a set of steps. The man on the left, a young man with a light brown skin tone and dark hair, wears a purple, high-collared uniform jacket and a matching purple pillbox-style hat with the words \"LOBBY BOY\" embroidered in gold. He stands with his hands clasped in front of him. The man on the right, seen from the back, has light skin and blond hair and is dressed in a purple, long-tailed coat. In the background, a third man wearing a dark overcoat and a dark hat is seen walking away into a building.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the three men and their attire, it describes the scene as if it were a static photograph rather than a video. The description of the man on the right as only \"seen from the back\" is likely incomplete; in a video, he would probably turn his head slightly, revealing a profile with a prominent mustache and a refined, perhaps slightly arrogant, expression as he speaks. The caption also misses the subtle but important movements of the lobby boy, who likely shifts his weight nervously or adjusts his hat, conveying his junior status. The description of the third man in the background is too generic; the video would surely offer a clearer view of his face, revealing him to be an older man with a graying beard and a stern gaze fixed directly on the two men in the foreground, suggesting he is observing their interaction. Furthermore, the caption fails to capture the dynamic of the conversation, which would be evident from the gesticulations of the man in the long-tailed coat and the attentive, slightly bowed posture of the lobby boy, indicating a clear hierarchical relationship of instruction and deference.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In the foreground, two men engage in a conversation on a set of steps. The young man on the left, with a light brown skin tone and dark hair, wears a purple, high-collared uniform jacket and a matching purple pillbox-style hat embroidered with \"LOBBY BOY\" in gold. He stands with his hands clasped, occasionally shifting his weight nervously or adjusting his hat, conveying his junior status. The man on the right, initially seen from the back, turns slightly to reveal a profile with a prominent mustache and a refined, perhaps slightly arrogant, expression as he speaks. He is dressed in a purple, long-tailed coat and gestures animatedly, indicating a dynamic conversation. In the background, a third man, wearing a dark overcoat and hat, walks away into a building. His face, now visible, shows an older man with a graying beard and a stern gaze fixed on the two men in the foreground, suggesting he is observing their interaction. The attentive, slightly bowed posture of the lobby boy further emphasizes the hierarchical relationship of instruction and deference between him and the man in the long-tailed coat.",
