    "pre_caption": "The video opens on a close-up of a dark, metallic steering yoke inside a vehicle. The camera then pans up to reveal a woman with brown skin sitting in the driver's seat. She wears a dark, sleeveless, leather-like vest over a light-colored top, and a watch is visible on her left wrist. She has a small piercing in her left nostril. With a neutral expression, she raises a pair of black binoculars to her eyes and looks forward, with the reflection of a distant, reddish landscape visible in the lenses.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a clear and logical sequence of events, it misses several key visual details that would enrich the description and better define the scene's atmosphere. The description of the woman is incomplete; the video clearly shows her dark hair is pulled back into a tight, practical bun, and she appears to be a woman in her late 30s, details that are omitted. Furthermore, the \"light-colored top\" is more specifically an off-white, long-sleeved thermal shirt, and the \"watch\" is a rugged, oversized digital field watch, both of which suggest a more utilitarian or survivalist context. The \"dark, metallic steering yoke\" is also an oversimplification; it is a complex, hexagonal control yoke with several integrated, faintly glowing blue indicator lights, pointing to a futuristic or specialized vehicle. Finally, the caption fails to mention the surrounding cockpit, which is visible and features a worn, scuffed dashboard with various functional switches, reinforcing the rugged feel of the setting. The reflection in the binoculars, while noted, is more specific than just a \"reddish landscape,\" as it clearly shows the sharp silhouettes of jagged rock spires, providing a more concrete image of the environment she is surveying.",
