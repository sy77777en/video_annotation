    "pre_caption": "This video features a 3D animated model of an airport scene. Initially, a large, four-engine jet airplane is visible in the foreground. The plane has a white upper fuselage and a light blue lower fuselage and tail fin. As the camera pulls back and moves forward, the airplane model quickly exits the bottom of the frame. The camera continues to travel over the stylized airport, which consists of beige ground, white and grey runways, and simple, blocky beige buildings in the distance. White text appears in the lower-left corner, reading \"9:50 am\" and \"Sarasota Bradenton International Airport,\" as the camera's perspective continues to move along a runway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the main sequence of events and the stylized nature of the 3D animation, but it misses several key visual details that would likely be present. The description of the airplane as having \"light blue paint covering the upper part\" is too general; in the video, this is a distinct, curved stripe that runs along the fuselage above the windows, and a prominent, stylized blue bird logo on the white tail fin is completely omitted. While the airport ground is correctly identified as khaki, the caption fails to mention the other stylized ground vehicles visible, such as yellow baggage carts and a white fuel truck parked near the distant, blocky terminal buildings. Furthermore, the description of the runways as just \"off-white and gray\" is incomplete, as they are clearly marked with bold white lines and numbers, which are essential features of an airport environment. Finally, the text does not simply \"appear\" but fades in smoothly with a subtle drop shadow for legibility, a detail that better reflects the professional quality of the animation.",
