    "pre_caption": "A woman with dark hair pulled back is seated at a desk in an office setting. She is wearing large, over-the-ear headphones, a dark gray short-sleeved t-shirt, and dark pants. She sits in a black office chair, leaning forward with her left elbow resting on the desk and her left hand touching the side of her head. Her gaze is directed downward at a piece of paper on the desk in front of her. The room is filled with electronic equipment, including multiple computer monitors and towers.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the woman and her general posture but misses several key actions and details that are central to the video. It fails to mention that her right hand is holding a black pen and she is actively writing or sketching diagrams in what is clearly a spiral-bound notebook, not just a single \"piece of paper.\" Her expression is one of intense concentration, with her brow slightly furrowed, a detail omitted from the description. The caption also treats the scene as static, whereas the video shows her periodically shifting her gaze from the notebook up to the main computer monitor, which displays scrolling lines of green text on a black background, before looking down to write again. Furthermore, the description of her attire is incomplete; her dark gray t-shirt has a small, white circular logo on the left sleeve. The \"large, over-the-ear headphones\" also have a distinct feature missed by the caption: a small, pulsing red light on the right earcup, indicating they are powered on. Finally, the desk contains other objects that provide context, such as a half-full white ceramic mug to her right and a smartphone lying face down near the keyboard.",
