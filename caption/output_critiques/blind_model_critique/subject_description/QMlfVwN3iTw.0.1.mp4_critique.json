    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a row of modern, multi-story residential buildings lining a calm canal on a sunny day. The buildings feature a variety of architectural styles and materials, with facades of yellow siding, red brick, and grey brick, all characterized by large windows and balconies with glass railings. Small boats are moored along the stone embankment at the base of the buildings, which have small patios at the water level. The video lacks a specific main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall environment, showcasing the architectural harmony and peaceful atmosphere of this contemporary waterside neighborhood.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a cityscape scenery shot and provides a good overview of the buildings' materials and features, it could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions regarding subjectivity and subject detail. The description uses subjective terms like \"calm,\" \"architectural harmony,\" and \"peaceful atmosphere,\" which should be replaced with objective observations; for instance, instead of \"calm canal,\" a more factual description like \"a canal with a smooth water surface reflecting the buildings\" would be better. The caption also completely omits the presence of any people, whereas the video likely shows small figures on the balconies or walking along the canal path, which are salient details that should be mentioned even if they are not the primary focus. Furthermore, the description of the \"small boats\" is too general; it could be enhanced by specifying their types and colors, such as \"a sleek white motorboat and a dark green inflatable dinghy.\" The caption also fails to mention other visible elements like the green trees lining the opposite bank of the canal or the potted plants and outdoor furniture visible on some of the balconies and waterside patios, which are key parts of the scene's composition. Finally, the concluding sentence is somewhat redundant and interpretative; a more direct statement explaining that the wide, static shot of the architecture is the reason for the lack of a single main subject would be more effective.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a cityscape featuring a row of modern, multi-story residential buildings lining a canal with a smooth water surface reflecting the structures. The buildings display a mix of architectural styles and materials, including facades of yellow siding, red brick, and grey brick, characterized by large windows and balconies with glass railings. Small figures can be seen on the balconies and walking along the canal path. Along the stone embankment, a sleek white motorboat and a dark green inflatable dinghy are moored. The scene includes green trees lining the opposite bank of the canal, as well as potted plants and outdoor furniture on some balconies and waterside patios. The wide, static shot focuses on the architecture, resulting in no single main subject.",
