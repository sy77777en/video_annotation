    "pre_caption": "A person wearing dark clothing stands at the end of a wooden dock that juts out into a body of water, surrounded by tall reeds. The focus then shifts to a close-up of a dark, metallic fishhook. The hook is curved, with a sharp, barbed point that has a single droplet of water on it, and it appears to have a rough or textured surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The camera begins with a wide shot of the interior space. As it moves outward through the window, the shot transitions to a wide shot of the exterior scene. During this flight, the camera shifts to a full shot of the fishhook, and finally concludes with an extreme wide shot of the lake and mountain landscape.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good sequential summary, but it lacks the specific detail and contextual connection that would likely be present in the video. The description of the \"person\" is vague; the video probably clarifies their gender and attire, such as a man wearing a dark hooded rain jacket and fishing waders, which would better establish the activity. The \"small orange package\" could be more precisely identified as a compact life vest or a small dry bag, adding functional detail. The caption also misses the atmospheric quality of the scene; the video might depict an early morning setting with mist rising from the calm water under an overcast sky, creating a specific mood. The transition \"The focus then shifts\" is imprecise; a \"hard cut\" is a more accurate description for a sudden scene change. Critically, the caption presents the fishhook as a disconnected object. The video likely frames it to be the person's hook, perhaps showing it dangling from a taut fishing line just above the water's surface. The description of the hook itself, while decent, could be enhanced; \"full shot\" is less accurate than \"macro shot\" or \"close-up,\" and \"textured surface\" could be specified as a \"ribbed shank\" or \"knurled grip\" to provide a clearer image.",

Next to him is a small orange dry bag. The early morning mist rises from the calm water under an overcast sky, creating a serene and contemplative atmosphere. A hard cut transitions to a macro shot of a dark, metallic fishhook, dangling from a taut fishing line just above the water's surface. The hook is curved, with a sharp, barbed point that glistens with a single droplet of water, and features a ribbed shank for a secure grip.",
