    "pre_caption": "A collection of various 360-degree and panoramic cameras is displayed standing upright. The cameras are predominantly black and dark gray, with different shapes and sizes. One prominent black camera features a large, single lens with \"Leica\" branding on the silver ring around it. Another tall, rectangular black camera has \"KANDAO\" printed on its side, while a smaller, compact black camera is labeled \"ONE X2\" below its screen. A silver, rectangular camera is marked with the brand \"trisio\" in white letters. Also visible is a black camera with a textured grip and \"RICOH\" branding. Most of the cameras feature dual, opposing fisheye lenses, characteristic of 360-degree models.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the various 360-degree cameras and their branding, it describes the scene as a static collection, which misrepresents the dynamic nature of the video. The video does not simply display the cameras; it features a slow, smooth pan from left to right across the 3D models within the software's preview window. As the view focuses on each camera, the model itself performs a slow 360-degree rotation, allowing the viewer to see its design from all angles, including the opposing fisheye lenses and any ports or buttons on the sides and back. The caption's statement that they are \"standing upright\" is incomplete, as their orientation is constantly changing. Furthermore, the description misses a key interactive element: a computer cursor is visible, and it clicks on each camera in the software's asset list to initiate its rotation in the preview window. The caption also omits small but significant visual details, such as the screen on the \"ONE X2\" being illuminated with a blue and white user interface, not just a blank screen, and a subtle animated glint that travels across the silver \"Leica\" lens ring as that camera turns. An improved description would incorporate the motion, the sequence of presentation, and the interaction with the software to more faithfully represent the video's content.",
