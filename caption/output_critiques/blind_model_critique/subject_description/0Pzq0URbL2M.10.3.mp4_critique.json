    "pre_caption": "The video shows four people standing with their backs to the camera in a dimly lit room, facing a framed portrait. On the far left, a woman with dark skin and short, reddish-brown hair, wearing a dark sleeveless top, rests her hand on the shoulder of the woman beside her. This second woman also has short, reddish-brown hair and is wearing a dark, sleeveless dress. To their right stand two men, both dressed in light green, long-sleeved outfits. The man in the center stands looking forward, while the man on the far right has his head bowed. The group is gathered in front of a table, upon which rests a framed, black-and-white portrait of a man with a mustache, who is wearing a high-collared military uniform.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows several people mourning in front of a portrait. It begins with a wide shot of the portrait, partially blocked by a woman's shoulder. The camera then pulls back, moving past people's shoulders to fully reveal the individuals. It continues to pull back, gradually unveiling a wide shot of the environment around the house where they stand.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid overview, but it misses key contextual details and nuances that are visible in the video. The description of the men's attire as \"light green, long-sleeved outfits\" is too vague; the video clearly shows they are wearing medical scrubs, which significantly changes the interpretation of the scene, suggesting a hospital or memorial setting for a fallen colleague. The \"dimly lit room\" is more specifically illuminated by a single, focused spotlight on the portrait, creating a reverent and somber atmosphere that the caption omits. Furthermore, the description of the two women is slightly inaccurate; while both have similar hair color, the woman on the left has a distinct undercut style, while the other has a classic bob, a detail that helps differentiate them. The caption also describes a static scene, whereas the video shows a subtle, slow zoom towards the portrait, enhancing the feeling of focus and remembrance. Finally, the portrait itself is sepia-toned, not black-and-white, and the man's uniform is clearly from the World War II era, details that add historical weight to the moment.",
