The camera then tilts downward to reveal a sprawling, verdant landscape of rolling hills covered in lush green trees and foliage. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment. The focus is on the striking visual of the rainbow over the expansive terrain rather than any specific object within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a landscape scenery shot and adheres to the structure for describing a scene without a main subject, it relies heavily on subjective adjectives, which the instructions advise against. Words like \"vibrant,\" \"dramatic,\" \"sprawling,\" \"lush,\" and \"striking\" convey an emotional impression rather than objective visual information. The description could be improved by replacing these with more concrete details. For instance, instead of a \"dramatic sky,\" you could describe it as \"a sky with dark grey storm clouds alongside patches of clear blue.\" The description of the landscape is also quite general; it could be enhanced by including specific, non-focal elements that might be visible, such as a narrow river winding through the hills or the distinct texture of dense forests versus open, grassy clearings. Furthermore, while mentioning the camera's tilt and pan explains how the scene is revealed, a more effective approach would be to describe the composition as it unfolds, such as, \"The view begins focused on a brightly-colored rainbow and expands downward to reveal a wide expanse of rolling green hills,\" which keeps the focus on the visual content rather than the filming technique.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a view of a rainbow arching across a sky filled with dark grey storm clouds and patches of clear blue. As the scene unfolds, the camera reveals a wide expanse of rolling green hills. The landscape features dense forests and open grassy clearings, with a narrow river winding through the terrain. The composition highlights the rainbow over the expansive natural environment, emphasizing the vastness and variety of the landscape.",
