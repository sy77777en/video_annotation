    "pre_caption": "This is an expansive landscape scenery shot capturing a breathtaking coastal view from a high vantage point. In the foreground, a dense, vibrant green forest canopy stretches out, covering rolling hills. Beyond the forest, a long, curving coastline with a sandy beach meets the calm, blue ocean, which extends to the horizon under a bright blue sky dotted with a few fluffy white clouds. There is no main subject in the video, as the composition is designed to emphasize the vast scale and serene beauty of the natural environment, focusing on the overall atmosphere rather than a specific entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a coastal landscape shot, it misses several key visual details and includes subjective language. The description uses terms like \"breathtaking\" and \"serene beauty,\" which should be replaced with more objective observations. For instance, the video clearly shows dynamic elements that are not mentioned; the \"calm, blue ocean\" actually has consistent, white-crested waves breaking along the sandy shore, and the \"fluffy white clouds\" are visibly drifting slowly across the sky, casting subtle, moving shadows on the hills below. Furthermore, the caption incorrectly states there is no subject. While there isn't a single main subject, the video does feature a small, white-and-red lighthouse on the most distant rocky point of the coastline and a distinct, light-brown dirt trail winding through the \"dense, vibrant green forest\" in the foreground. The forest itself is not uniformly green; it contains visible patches of darker, coniferous trees mixed with the lighter deciduous canopy, adding texture that the current description overlooks. Including these specific details about motion, minor subjects, and textural variations would create a more accurate and comprehensive depiction of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures an expansive coastal landscape from a high vantage point, highlighting dynamic and detailed elements of the scene. In the foreground, a diverse forest canopy stretches over rolling hills, featuring a mix of darker coniferous trees and lighter deciduous foliage, adding rich texture. A light-brown dirt trail winds through the forest, leading the eye toward the coastline. Beyond the forest, a long, curving sandy beach meets the ocean, where consistent, white-crested waves break along the shore. The ocean extends to the horizon under a bright blue sky, with fluffy white clouds drifting slowly and casting subtle, moving shadows on the hills below. On the most distant rocky point of the coastline, a small white-and-red lighthouse stands as a notable feature, adding interest to the vast natural environment. This composition emphasizes the intricate details and dynamic elements of the landscape.",
