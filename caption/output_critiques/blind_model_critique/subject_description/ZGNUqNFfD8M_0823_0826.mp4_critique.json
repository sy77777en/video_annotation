    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the focus on a woman, seen as a dark silhouette in the distance at the top of a set of stairs. The focus then shifts to a young, light-skinned man in the foreground, who is initially blurry. He has short, dark hair and is seen in profile, wearing a dark jacket over a light blue collared shirt. As the focus racks, the man becomes sharp and clear, while the woman in the background blurs out of focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subjects and the main action of a rack focus, it violates several key instructions. The use of temporal phrases like \"The video begins with\" and \"Midway through the video,\" as well as the technical term \"focus racks,\" goes against the directive to use simple, natural English and describe the scene holistically. The caption also uses the forbidden word \"image.\" Furthermore, the description could be more visually evocative. For instance, the \"dark silhouette of a woman\" could be enhanced by describing her posture—perhaps she is standing rigidly, looking up the stairs. The main subject, the young man, is described in profile, but the caption misses the opportunity to note his expression once he becomes clear; imagining the video, he might have a pensive or determined look on his face as he gazes intently off-screen to the left. Finally, the description of the man in the red leather jacket is vague; it could be improved by specifying the nature of his appearance, such as describing it as a \"brief, stylized flash\" or a \"graphic overlay,\" which would better capture the visual effect without using prohibited terms.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman stands at the top of a staircase, her silhouette dark and mysterious, perhaps standing rigidly as she gazes upward. In the foreground, a young, light-skinned man with short, dark hair comes into view. He wears a dark jacket over a light blue collared shirt and looks off to the left with a pensive expression. The scene shifts, bringing the man into sharp focus while the woman fades into the background. A brief, stylized flash introduces a man in a red leather jacket, adding a dynamic visual element to the scene.",
