    "pre_caption": "In a dark and foggy setting, three silhouetted figures walk away from the viewer on a wet path. The most prominent figure, a woman in the center, wears a dark, long-sleeved, mid-calf dress with a pronounced hourglass silhouette created by a cinched waist and padded hips; her hair is pulled back into a tight updo. To her left, another person wears a dark, oversized jacket, dark briefs, and dark knee-high socks or boots. A third figure is faintly visible in the background, further down the path and obscured by the fog.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is:\nThe caption incorrectly describes the figures as \"silhouetted,\" which contradicts the detailed clothing descriptions that follow. In the video, the figures are not true silhouettes but are captured in a low-key, high-contrast lighting scheme where shadows are deep, but the specific textures and forms of their attire are intentionally revealed. For instance, the woman's dress is not just dark but appears to be made of a heavy, matte fabric like velvet, and her hat is a dramatic, wide-brimmed asymmetrical design, a key detail that \"hat\" fails to capture. The description of the \"wet path\" is also understated; the path is covered in shallow puddles that create distinct, shimmering reflections of the figures as they move. Furthermore, the caption is uncertain about the second figure's legwear (\"socks or boots\"), whereas the video clearly shows them wearing sleek, dark, thigh-high patent leather boots that catch the minimal light. Finally, the caption misses the quality of the movement; the woman's walk is a slow, deliberate, and stylized strut, not just a simple walk, which is crucial to the video's avant-garde tone.",
