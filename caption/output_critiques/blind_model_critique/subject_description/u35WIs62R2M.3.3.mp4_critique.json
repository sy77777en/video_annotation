    "pre_caption": "This video presents an aerial seascape scenery shot, captured from a high, tilted angle looking down upon a vast expanse of water. The deep teal ocean is covered in a fine texture of countless small ripples, stretching out towards a hazy horizon. In the upper portion of the frame, a soft, bright light, likely the sun, diffuses through the atmosphere, illuminating a single, dark, and wispy cloud formation that drifts across the pale sky. The composition intentionally lacks a main subject, directing the viewer's focus instead to the immense scale of the ocean and the serene, atmospheric quality of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively describes the overall aerial seascape and the texture of the deep teal water, it has several inaccuracies and omissions based on the visual content. The description incorrectly speculates that the bright, diffused light is \"likely the sun\" instead of simply describing the light itself, and it fails to mention the prominent, shimmering path of reflected light this creates across the water's rippled surface, a key visual element that draws the eye toward the hazy horizon. The caption also violates the instructions by using the forbidden term \"frame\" and the subjective emotional adjective \"serene.\" Furthermore, the final sentence offers an interpretation of the composition's intent rather than a direct description of the scene; a better approach would be to state that the vastness of the ocean and sky are the primary focus, without a specific subject. The description of the \"dark teal\" cloud is accurate, but its slow, steady drift from left to right across the upper portion of the view is a subtle motion that could be noted to add more dynamic detail to the otherwise static scenery.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video showcases an aerial view of a vast expanse of water, captured from a high, tilted angle. The deep teal ocean is textured with countless small ripples, extending towards a hazy horizon. A bright, diffused light creates a prominent, shimmering path of reflection across the water's surface, drawing the eye toward the horizon. In the upper portion of the scene, a dark, wispy cloud drifts slowly and steadily from left to right across the pale sky. The focus is on the immense scale of the ocean and sky, without a specific subject.",
