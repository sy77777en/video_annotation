    "pre_caption": "A group of young people celebrates in a room with a black and white checkered floor. In the center, a person with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a dark blue long-sleeved shirt, leans over and embraces a smaller person who is wearing a blue t-shirt. Both are being showered with white and colored confetti that falls from above. Other people surround them, including a person in a white t-shirt with a colorful graphic who has their arms raised, and another individual in a white t-shirt with red and black stripes on the sleeves. The group is tightly clustered together in a celebratory manner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the central action of an embrace amidst a celebration and notes key details like the checkered floor and confetti, it misses crucial visual information that would likely be prominent in the video. The description lacks any mention of the subjects' facial expressions; in a celebratory scene like this, the people embracing would likely be visibly joyful, smiling, or even crying with happiness, and the surrounding crowd would be cheering or laughing. The description of the second person in the embrace is minimal, only noting they are \"smaller\"; details about their hair color, style, and their reaction or posture within the hug are omitted. Furthermore, the term \"wind instrument\" is vague; the video would likely show a specific instrument like a trumpet or saxophone, and describing the player's puffed cheeks would add to the accuracy. The caption uses the neutral term \"person\" for everyone, but if gender is discernible for some individuals, specifying \"man\" or \"woman\" would provide a more complete picture. Finally, the description of the surrounding crowd is sparse; mentioning their collective actions, such as clapping, raising their hands, or filming with phones, would better convey the dynamic and energetic atmosphere of the event rather than simply stating they are \"clustered together in a celebratory manner,\" which is an interpretation rather than a direct visual description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A group of young people celebrates in a room with a black and white checkered floor. In the center, a person with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a dark blue long-sleeved shirt, leans over and embraces a smaller person with short brown hair, who is wearing a blue t-shirt. Both are smiling broadly as they are showered with white and colored confetti falling from above. The surrounding crowd is visibly joyful, with some individuals clapping, cheering, and capturing the moment on their phones. A man in a white t-shirt with a colorful graphic has his arms raised in excitement, while another person in a white t-shirt with red and black stripes on the sleeves is laughing. The lively atmosphere is further enhanced by a musician playing a trumpet, their cheeks puffed as they contribute to the celebratory sound. The group is tightly clustered together, exuding a sense of shared happiness and excitement.",
