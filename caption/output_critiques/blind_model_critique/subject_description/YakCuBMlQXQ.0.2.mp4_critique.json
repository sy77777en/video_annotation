    "pre_caption": "In the foreground, a person lies on the ground, with their legs clad in black pants and white sneakers visible. A man dressed entirely in black walks forward from the middle ground. He wears black combat boots, black pants with a thigh holster on his right leg, a black coat over a black shirt, and black leather gloves. He holds a silver handgun in his right hand. As his upper body is revealed, he is shown to be a man with a short, dark beard and dark hair, wearing black sunglasses. In the background, another man stands, wearing a black short-sleeved shirt and a black tactical vest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video takes place in a forest scene. Initially, a person lying on the ground is visible in the foreground, with only part of their legs and hands showing. In the middle ground, a person in black walks toward the camera, with only his feet and part of his legs visible. As the camera tilts upward, the person's body is gradually revealed, and the shot ends with a medium close-up of this person's upper body.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by identifying the subjects and their basic attire, but it lacks the dynamic context and crucial details that define the scene's narrative. For example, the man in black isn't just \"walking\"; he is advancing cautiously with his silver handgun held in a two-handed grip and aimed directly at the person on the ground, indicating he is actively securing a target. The description of the kneeling woman is too passive; she is positioned directly beside the person on the ground and appears to be rendering aid, perhaps checking for injuries, which creates a direct relationship between them that the caption misses. A significant omission is that the man in the background tactical vest is holding a black rifle at a low-ready position, actively scanning the area and providing cover, which is a key element of the scene's tension. The caption could also be more specific about the person on the ground; rather than just \"lies,\" they are lying face-down with their hands seemingly restrained behind their back, clarifying their status as a subdued suspect or captive. Integrating these actions and interactions would transform the description from a simple list of subjects into a coherent depiction of a tense, tactical situation.",
