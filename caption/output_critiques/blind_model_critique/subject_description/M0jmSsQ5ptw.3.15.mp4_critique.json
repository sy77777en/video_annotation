    "pre_caption": "A tall wooden table is positioned in the foreground, with a blue and silver Red Bull can sitting on a block of ice, flanked by two yellow ice axes stuck into the tabletop. In the background, a white, yellow, and red helicopter with a graffiti-style Red Bull logo design is on the ground. A man with light skin, wearing a tan hooded jacket with a black patch on the sleeve, a grey beanie, and blue goggles pushed up on his forehead, walks into the scene. He approaches the table, picks up the can, and then turns, carrying a black and white snowboard, to walk toward the helicopter.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The scene opens near a landing pad. A can sits on a tall table dominating the frame. In the distance, a plane stands before the mountains, ready for takeoff. A man with a skateboard enters from the left, his upper body visible. He takes the can and then circles the table toward the plane, briefly leaving the frame with only his hand and skateboard in view. Then he shows again, and the shot shifts from a medium shot to a full shot of him.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately details the subjects' visual attributes, such as the graffiti on the helicopter and the specific Red Bull branding, its structure and focus could be improved. The description begins with a static object, the table, which I imagine is not the primary focus of the video. The main event is the man's action, and the caption would be more dynamic if it introduced him first within the larger setting. The caption completely omits the environment; I imagine this scene occurs on a vast, snow-covered mountain, a critical piece of context that explains the presence of a snowboard, ice axes, and a helicopter. The description of the action is also slightly imprecise. It seems unlikely the man would be \"holding\" the snowboard in one hand while running; it's more plausible that it's strapped to his back or tucked under his arm for better mobility. Furthermore, the description feels incomplete, as it stops with him running toward the helicopter. I imagine the video continues to show him reaching the aircraft, with its rotors spinning, and perhaps beginning to board, which would be a more logical conclusion to the described sequence.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man with light skin, wearing a tan hooded jacket with a black patch on the sleeve, a grey beanie, and blue goggles pushed up on his forehead, strides confidently across a vast, snow-covered mountain. In the foreground, a tall wooden table holds a blue and silver Red Bull can perched on a block of ice, flanked by two yellow ice axes embedded in the tabletop. Behind him, a white, yellow, and red helicopter with a graffiti-style Red Bull logo rests on the ground, its rotors spinning. The man approaches the table, picks up the can, and tucks a black and white snowboard under his arm. He then turns and makes his way toward the helicopter, ready to board for his next adventure.",
