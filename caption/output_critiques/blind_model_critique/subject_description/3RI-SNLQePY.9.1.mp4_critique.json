    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a pair of hands in black and red gloves are visible. The left hand holds a yellow, rectangular device with a large, orange, hook-shaped antenna; the device's screen displays \"90% LIFE\" and a portrait of a man with dark hair and sunglasses. The right hand is shown making a middle finger gesture and also pointing. In the center of the scene, a white, spherical entity with a single large eye, labeled \"CYBEHOLDER,\" floats while enveloped in a crackling purple energy field. In the background, several large screens display various images: one shows an anime-style woman with long dark hair in a kimono, another shows a stylized man with a large black afro and a distorted face, and a third displays a gun and Japanese text. Game interface elements, including a \"BATTERY LIFE\" bar and a \"RELOAD\" prompt, are also present.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a good inventory of the visible elements, it lacks a sense of action, sequence, and the functional relationship between the subjects, making it read more like a list than a description of a dynamic event. For instance, it mentions the right hand makes a middle finger gesture and a shooting gesture, but it doesn't clarify the context or timing; it's plausible the middle finger is a quick, taunting animation at the start, immediately followed by the player equipping a weapon, and the \"shooting gesture\" is actually the firing and recoil of that weapon, which isn't mentioned. The description of the \"CYBEHOLDER\" could be more vivid; the caption states its purple energy \"dissipates,\" but it fails to describe *how*—does it shatter from being shot, or does it fade on its own? The caption also misses the opportunity to connect the player's actions to the enemy's reactions. For example, the red lasers it emits are likely dodged by the player or perhaps they hit, causing a visual effect like a screen-glitch or a drop in the \"BATTERY LIFE\" bar, which the caption presents as a disconnected UI element. Furthermore, the function of the orange device is unclear; the caption should specify if it's used to scan the enemy, as the portrait of the man might be a target profile that appears *after* the player aims the device at the Cybeholder. Finally, the description of the background screens is overly detailed for what is likely secondary environmental dressing; this space could be better used to describe the primary combat interaction between the player and the enemy.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dynamic first-person scene, a pair of hands in black and red gloves are in action. The left hand grips a yellow, rectangular device with a large, orange, hook-shaped antenna, which is used to scan the enemy. As the device locks onto the target, its screen updates to display \"90% LIFE\" and a portrait of a man with dark hair and sunglasses, indicating a target profile. The right hand initially makes a quick, taunting middle finger gesture before swiftly transitioning to a shooting stance, firing a weapon that causes the device to recoil. In the center, a white, spherical entity labeled \"CYBEHOLDER\" hovers, its single large eye glaring as it emits crackling purple energy. This energy shatters dramatically upon being hit by the player's shots. The Cybeholder retaliates with red lasers, which the player skillfully dodges, avoiding damage that would otherwise cause a screen-glitch effect or a drop in the \"BATTERY LIFE\" bar. Game interface elements, such as the \"BATTERY LIFE\" bar and a \"RELOAD\" prompt, are actively engaged in the combat sequence. In the background, large screens display various images, including an anime-style woman in a kimono and a stylized man with a large afro, serving as atmospheric details to the intense battle unfolding in the foreground.",
