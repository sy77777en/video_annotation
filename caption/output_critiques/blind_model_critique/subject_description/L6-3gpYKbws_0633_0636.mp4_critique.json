    "pre_caption": "This is a split-level marine scenery shot capturing a tranquil bay flanked by a steep, verdant mountain on one side and a lush, tree-covered shoreline on the other. Several sailboats are moored in the distance under a partly cloudy blue sky, and the perspective begins at the water's surface before submerging to reveal the clear, turquoise water and the rocky, algae-covered seabed below. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on the immersive experience of the environment. The shot's purpose is to showcase the serene atmosphere of the bay and the beautiful contrast between the sunlit world above and the quiet, submerged landscape beneath the surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the general scenery, it misses several key visual details and could be more precise. The description of the shot as \"split-level\" is slightly misleading, as the video shows a dynamic camera movement that begins at the surface and then fully submerges, rather than holding a static half-in, half-out perspective. The underwater scene is described too generically; the video clearly shows not just \"algae-covered\" rocks, but distinct patches of dark green seaweed and several small, spiny sea urchins clinging to the crevices. Crucially, the caption fails to mention the small school of silver fish that darts through the frame as the camera goes underwater, which is a significant element of life in the scene. Above the water, one of the sailboats is not \"moored\" but is actually sailing slowly with its white mainsail partially raised, creating gentle ripples on the otherwise calm surface. Finally, the last sentence explaining the shot's \"purpose\" and \"immersive experience\" is an interpretation rather than a direct visual description and should be removed to adhere to the instruction of describing only what is visible.",
