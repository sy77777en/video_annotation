    "pre_caption": "This is an underwater scenery shot that explores a shallow marine ecosystem. The scene is characterized by large, algae-covered rocks resting on a sandy seabed, surrounded by dense beds of green seagrass. Numerous small, silvery fish, including some striped sergeant major fish, swim in schools around the rocks and through the seagrass. The camera's movement, which pulls back from a close-up and eventually breaks the water's surface to show the rocky shoreline, emphasizes the environment as a whole. There is no main subject because the focus is on the atmosphere and the interconnectedness of the habitat, showcasing the relationship between the rocks, plants, and fish rather than highlighting a single object or creature.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the primary components of the underwater scene, such as the algae-covered rocks, sandy seabed, seagrass, and various fish species, it could be improved in several areas. The description of the transition from underwater to the surface is weak; instead of stating \"The camera's movement...breaks the water's surface,\" it should describe the visual shift from the viewer's perspective, such as \"the view tilts upward through the water column, eventually emerging to reveal a rocky shoreline.\" Furthermore, the caption fails to describe the shoreline itself after mentioning it. In the video, the shoreline consists of dark, jagged rocks glistening with water, which is a key visual detail that should have been included. The caption also uses interpretive phrases like \"emphasizes the environment as a whole\" and \"showcasing the relationship,\" which are subjective and violate the instruction to stick to objective visual description. Finally, the caption begins with the introductory phrase \"This is an underwater scenery shot,\" which should be omitted, and the justification for the lack of a main subject is overly explanatory; a more concise statement that the focus is on the overall habitat would be more effective.",
