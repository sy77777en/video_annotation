    "pre_caption": "This video presents a bleak landscape scenery shot of a desolate and abandoned town. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on creating a pervasive atmosphere of decay and emptiness, with the composition encouraging the viewer to take in the entire desolate environment. In the foreground, a dark, single-story house with a broken window and a satellite dish sits on gravelly, debris-strewn ground. Behind it, a larger building and a prominent clock tower stand against a backdrop of hazy hills, while a lone utility pole punctuates the sky. Fine particles, resembling dust or ash, drift through the air, enhancing the scene's post-apocalyptic and somber tone under an overcast sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot of an abandoned town and notes several key elements, it misses some specific visual details and relies too heavily on subjective, atmospheric language, which the instructions advise against. For instance, instead of stating the scene has a \"somber tone,\" it would be more accurate to describe the visual cause, such as the desaturated, grey-scale color palette and the low-contrast lighting from the overcast sky. The description of the \"larger building\" is too vague; in the video, it appears to be a derelict brick factory, identifiable by its tall, silent smokestack. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention a crucial detail on the \"prominent clock tower\": its hands are visibly broken and frozen at 2:17, adding a specific point of interest. The description of the ground as \"debris-strewn\" could be more precise by noting the visible rusted car parts and splintered wooden planks scattered near the house. Finally, the caption treats the scene as static, but the video includes a very slow, almost imperceptible pan from left to right, which gradually reveals the clock tower from behind the single-story house. Mentioning this movement would more accurately reflect the experience of watching the video rather than viewing a still image.",
