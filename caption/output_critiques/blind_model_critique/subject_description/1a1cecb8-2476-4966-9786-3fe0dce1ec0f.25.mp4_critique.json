    "pre_caption": "This is a first-person perspective shot featuring a person with light skin, bright pink shoulder-length hair, large black-framed glasses, and a black face mask. They are wearing a dark t-shirt under a dark hooded sweatshirt. In the scene with them is another person wearing a light beige long-sleeved top, dark pants, and white shoes. This second person is bent over at the waist, facing away from the camera and toward the base of a yellow pole on the sidewalk. As the perspective shifts, the person with pink hair moves from the right side to the lower left of the view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a street scene with two people. It starts with a person with pink hair, glasses, and a black mask, whose chest-up body occupies 50% of the right side of the frame's height. On the left, a person in light clothes is bent down, with their full body occupying less than 50% of the frame's height. The camera then pans right, leaving the pink-haired person in the lower left corner, revealing more of the street.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the key features of the person with pink hair, such as their glasses and face mask, it lacks crucial context about the actions and relationship between the subjects. The description of the second person as simply \"bent over\" is too vague; in the video, they are clearly pausing to tie the laces on one of their white shoes near the yellow pole, an important detail that explains their posture. The caption also omits that the person filming is actively walking forward on a city sidewalk, which is what causes the perspective to shift, rather than it being an arbitrary camera movement. Furthermore, the description of the main subject's clothing as \"dark-colored\" could be more specific, as the video shows a black leather jacket over a charcoal grey t-shirt. Finally, the caption describes the two individuals as separate entities, whereas the video suggests they are companions walking together, a relationship that could be conveyed by phrasing the description to reflect them as a pair from the outset.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a first-person perspective of a city sidewalk, where the person filming is walking forward. In the frame is a person with light skin, bright pink shoulder-length hair, large black-framed glasses, and a black face mask. They are wearing a black leather jacket over a charcoal grey t-shirt. Accompanying them is another person in a light beige long-sleeved top, dark pants, and white shoes. This second person is pausing to tie the laces on one of their white shoes near the base of a yellow pole. As the person filming continues to walk, the perspective shifts, moving the person with pink hair from the right side to the lower left of the view, highlighting their companionship as they navigate the city together.",
