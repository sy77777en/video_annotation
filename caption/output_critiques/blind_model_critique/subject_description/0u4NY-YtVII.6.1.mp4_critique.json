    "pre_caption": "An isometric animation on a dark grid background depicts a financial transaction. In the center-left, a collection of items includes various groceries like a red sausage, a yellow wheel of cheese, a white carton of eggs, and a white bottle with a blue cap, alongside a stack of gold coins. A teal, rectangular button with the word \"Buy\" in white text is positioned in front of these items. From this central group, two glowing light-blue lines extend. The upper line, labeled with \"5%\", connects to a white paper receipt labeled \"Voucher\" that holds a yellow plastic shopping basket. The lower line, labeled with \"95%\", connects to a stack of green banknotes marked with the euro symbol. The white text \"Own opinion\" is displayed in the bottom-right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the static objects and their attributes, but it fails to describe the video's animated nature, instead presenting the scene as a static infographic. The video likely shows a sequence of actions to illustrate the transaction. For instance, the \"Buy\" button probably animates as if being pressed, which then triggers the two glowing light-blue lines to extend outwards from the central items toward their respective destinations. The voucher, shopping basket, and banknotes might not be present initially but could animate into view as the lines reach them, visually representing the outcome of the purchase. Furthermore, the caption's mention of \"Own opinion\" is ambiguous; in the video, this text is likely a static watermark or a non-diegetic label present throughout, rather than an element that appears as part of the transaction animation, a distinction the description should make clear. The caption describes the final state of the diagram but misses the entire process of its formation, which is the core content of the animation.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features an isometric animation on a dark grid background illustrating a financial transaction. Initially, a collection of items, including groceries like a red sausage, a yellow wheel of cheese, a white carton of eggs, and a white bottle with a blue cap, is shown alongside a stack of gold coins. A teal, rectangular \"Buy\" button animates as if being pressed, triggering two glowing light-blue lines to extend outward. The upper line, labeled \"5%\", connects to a white paper receipt labeled \"Voucher,\" which animates into view holding a yellow plastic shopping basket. The lower line, labeled \"95%\", extends to a stack of green banknotes marked with the euro symbol, which also animates into view. Throughout the animation, the white text \"Own opinion\" remains as a static watermark in the bottom-right corner, not part of the transaction sequence. The animation effectively demonstrates the process and outcome of the purchase.",
