    "pre_caption": "The video showcases a series of classical-style stone statues arranged in an indoor gallery. The first is a male figure, nude from the waist up, with short, curly hair. He stands with his right hand placed on the shoulder of a female statue beside him. This female statue is depicted as a warrior, wearing a crested helmet and draped garments, and holding a round shield in her left hand. As the view pans to the right, a third statue of a woman is revealed. She is also dressed in draped clothing, with her hair partially covered by a veil. She holds a small, indistinct object in her right hand, raised toward her face. All the statues are a uniform, light-yellowish color, consistent with marble under warm lighting, and are positioned within architectural niches.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The shot begins in a full view of the statue (though its feet are cropped out), showing the figure framed within its niche. As the camera moves closer, the framing shifts into a medium shot, focusing on the statue’s upper body, drapery, and facial details. Finally, the camera moves back out to restore the full shot, once again presenting the statue in its architectural setting.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview of the scene and subjects, but it could be enhanced with more specific visual details that would likely be apparent in the video. For instance, the description of the third statue holding a \"small object\" is too vague; the video would probably reveal if this object is a patera, a scroll, or a small bird, which is a key iconographic detail. Similarly, for the central female warrior, the caption omits what is in her right hand—is it holding a spear, resting on her hip, or is the arm missing? This is a significant missing attribute. The description of the male statue as \"nude from the waist up\" leaves his lower body and overall pose ambiguous; the video would clarify if he is wearing draped fabric below the waist and what his arms are doing. The spatial relationship \"slightly ahead\" could be more precise, such as \"standing on a pedestal in the foreground to the left of the niche.\" Finally, while the uniform color is noted, the video would likely show textural details like cracks, chips, or variations in the marble's patina from age, which are crucial characteristics of classical statuary and would add significant depth to the description.",
