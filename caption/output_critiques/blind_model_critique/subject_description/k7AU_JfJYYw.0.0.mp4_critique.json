    "pre_caption": "A young man with light skin and short, dark, tousled hair stands in profile facing the left side of the scene. He is dressed in a monochromatic outfit consisting of a black short-sleeved t-shirt and black trousers. He holds a long, wooden pool cue vertically in his right hand, gripping it near the middle, while his left hand is tucked casually into his pants pocket. He stands directly beside a billiard table that features a black frame and a red felt surface, upon which several yellow and black billiard balls are visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by accurately identifying the man and the billiard table, but it misses several key dynamic and contextual elements from the video. The description portrays a static scene, whereas the man is not perfectly still; he subtly shifts his weight and leans forward slightly, studying the table with a focused expression, his brow slightly furrowed in concentration. His left hand is not in his pocket but rests on the black frame of the table, a pose more indicative of a player preparing for a shot. Furthermore, the description of the pool cue as 'held vertically' is slightly inaccurate, as he holds it upright with its butt resting on the floor beside him. A crucial detail omitted is the state of the game: the balls are scattered across the red felt, not racked, with the white cue ball positioned for a clear shot on the black 8-ball, suggesting a pivotal moment. Finally, the caption fails to mention the most prominent light source—a low-hanging conical lamp directly over the table that casts a bright circle of light on the felt and leaves the surrounding area in shadow, which is essential for understanding the scene's composition and mood.",
