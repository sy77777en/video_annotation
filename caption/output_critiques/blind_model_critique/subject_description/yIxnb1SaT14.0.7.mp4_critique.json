    "pre_caption": "A large, ornate clock is centrally featured on the facade of a light-colored stone building at night. The clock face is circular, white, and illuminated from behind, causing it to glow. It has black Roman numerals and intricate black hands. The clock is set within a large, carved stone arch. Below the clock, the words \"PARIS-ORLEANS\" are carved into the stone in a dark, capitalized font. The building is lit from below, highlighting its detailed architectural features against a dark, cloudy sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the central subject as the ornate clock on the Musée d'Orsay facade, it misses several key dynamic and contextual elements present in the video. The description of the lighting as \"occasionally illuminated\" is too vague; the video clearly shows a programmed light show where waves of cool blue and warm gold light sweep vertically up the facade in a repeating pattern, creating a pulsing effect that is central to the viewing experience. Furthermore, the caption treats the scene as a static image, failing to mention that the video is a time-lapse. This is a significant omission, as the rapid movement of the clock's hands and the swift drift of clouds across the sky are prominent visual features. The description also neglects to mention the camera's slow, deliberate zoom, which starts with a wider shot of the building's upper architecture and gradually pushes in to tightly frame the clock, making it the hero of the shot over time. Finally, the caption overlooks the silhouettes of several people visible on the observation deck directly beneath the clock, whose presence provides a sense of scale and life that is otherwise missing from the description.",
