    "pre_caption": "This video captures an expansive aerial landscape scenery shot, revealing a breathtaking panorama of a tropical coastline. The view sweeps over the vibrant green canopy of a dense, rolling jungle that stretches down to meet the deep blue ocean. In the distance, the shoreline curves into a wide bay under a bright blue sky lightly scattered with fluffy white clouds. There is no single main subject in this shot. The focus is intentionally broad, capturing the immense scale and natural beauty of the entire environment. The composition emphasizes the relationship between the forest, the land, and the sea, creating an atmospheric and immersive experience rather than directing attention to a specific object or entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as an aerial landscape shot of a tropical coastline, it could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions regarding objectivity and detail. The description uses subjective and emotional adjectives like \"breathtaking,\" \"vibrant,\" and \"atmospheric,\" which should be replaced with more neutral, descriptive language. For instance, the transition from land to sea is vaguely described; a more accurate caption would specify if a \"strip of white sand beach\" separates the \"green jungle\" from the ocean. Additionally, the water itself likely has more detail than just \"deep blue,\" perhaps showing \"turquoise shallows near the shore\" or \"white foam from breaking waves.\" The absolute claim that there is \"no single main subject\" might be inaccurate; even in a wide shot, a small but distinct object like a \"lone white sailboat in the bay\" or a \"small cluster of rock formations just offshore\" would be a salient subject requiring a brief mention. Finally, the last two sentences explaining the shot's purpose are redundant and overly explanatory; this information could be conveyed more concisely by simply focusing on the descriptive elements of the vast landscape, allowing the scale to speak for itself.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video presents an aerial view of a tropical coastline, showcasing a wide panorama of the landscape. The camera sweeps over the dense green jungle canopy, which extends down to a strip of white sand beach meeting the ocean. The water transitions from turquoise shallows near the shore to deeper blue hues further out, with white foam from breaking waves visible. In the distance, the shoreline curves into a wide bay under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. A lone white sailboat can be seen in the bay, adding a point of interest to the expansive scene. The composition highlights the natural relationship between the forest, land, and sea, capturing the vastness and detail of the environment.",
