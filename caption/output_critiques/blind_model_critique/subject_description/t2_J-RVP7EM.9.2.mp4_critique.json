    "pre_caption": "A small, old book with a reddish-brown cover rests on a dark brown wooden surface. The cover is decorated with faded, gold-colored ornate tooling around the border and corners. In the center, a white cross is depicted within a red rectangular field, which is also framed by the gold-colored tooling. The book appears worn, with frayed edges and aged pages that show a greenish-blue tint along their sides.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subject as an old book and describes its basic cover design, it presents a static scene and misses several key dynamic and detailed visual elements from the video. The description fails to mention the slow, deliberate pan of the camera from left to right across the cover, which emphasizes the worn texture of the leather and the way light catches the faded gold tooling. It also completely omits the moment a hand with long, slender fingers enters the frame to gently open the book, revealing a title page with elegant calligraphy that is not described. Furthermore, the caption is incomplete as the video also features a clear shot of the book's spine, showing five raised bands and a partially legible title, which are crucial identifying features. The description of the page edges as having a \"greenish-blue tint\" is an oversimplification; the video's close-up reveals this to be tarnished silver-gilt edging, with a subtle metallic sheen visible as the book is handled. Finally, the \"ornate tooling\" is shown in a macro shot to be a specific repeating pattern of fleur-de-lis, a more precise detail that the caption overlooks.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a slow, deliberate pan from left to right across the cover of a small, old book resting on a dark brown wooden surface. The reddish-brown leather cover, worn with age, catches the light, highlighting the faded gold-colored ornate tooling that frames the border and corners in a repeating fleur-de-lis pattern. In the center, a white cross is depicted within a red rectangular field, also framed by the gold tooling. As the camera moves, a hand with long, slender fingers enters the frame, gently opening the book to reveal a title page adorned with elegant calligraphy. The spine of the book is shown in detail, featuring five raised bands and a partially legible title, adding to its historical character. The edges of the aged pages are revealed to have tarnished silver-gilt edging, with a subtle metallic sheen that becomes visible as the book is handled.",
