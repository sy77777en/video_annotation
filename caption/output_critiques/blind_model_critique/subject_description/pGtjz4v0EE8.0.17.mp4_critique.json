    "pre_caption": "The video displays a collection of large, classical-style statues in an outdoor, arcaded setting, surrounded by a crowd of people. The main focus is on the sculptures. A prominent bronze statue depicts a nude man with a winged helmet, holding a sword and standing over a decapitated female figure, all set upon an ornate pedestal. Nearby is a dynamic white marble sculpture of a man in a helmet carrying a woman, with another figure at their feet. To its right is a white marble statue of a seated lion with its front paw on a sphere. Other marble statues, including a robed male figure, are set in niches in the background wall. The secondary subjects are the numerous tourists, men and women of various ages in casual clothing, who are standing and sitting on the steps of the statue bases, observing the art.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid overview of the scene, correctly identifying the primary statues and the general setting. However, it could be more specific and evocative. The description of the main sculpture as a man \"holding another figure\" is too vague; the video clearly shows the figure is the decapitated body of Medusa, a key detail of the Perseus myth depicted. The description of the tourists is generic; the video shows specific actions, such as a woman in a blue shirt taking a photo with her smartphone and a man gesturing towards the lion statue, which would add more life to the scene. Furthermore, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the bright, direct sunlight that casts sharp shadows across the piazza, highlighting the weathered texture of the marble and the polished gleam of the bronze. The phrasing \"some moving to the midground\" is slightly awkward; it would be clearer to state that other statues, like one depicting a struggle between three figures, come into focus as the camera pans. Finally, while the instructions advise against speculation, the unique collection of sculptures makes the location identifiable as the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence, and adding this context would greatly improve the caption's value.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a stunning collection of large, classical-style statues in the outdoor arcaded setting of the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence, surrounded by a lively crowd. The main focus is on the sculptures, particularly a prominent bronze statue of Perseus triumphantly holding the decapitated head of Medusa, a key element of the myth, while standing over her body on an ornate pedestal. Nearby, a dynamic white marble sculpture depicts a man in a helmet carrying a woman, with another figure at their feet, capturing a moment of intense action. To its right, a white marble statue of a seated lion rests its front paw on a sphere, exuding regal calm. Other marble statues, including a robed male figure, are set in niches along the background wall. The scene is animated by numerous tourists, such as a woman in a blue shirt capturing the moment with her smartphone and a man gesturing animatedly towards the lion statue. The bright, direct sunlight casts sharp shadows across the piazza, accentuating the weathered texture of the marble and the polished gleam of the bronze. As the camera pans, other statues, like one depicting a struggle between three figures, come into focus, adding depth to the vibrant scene.",
