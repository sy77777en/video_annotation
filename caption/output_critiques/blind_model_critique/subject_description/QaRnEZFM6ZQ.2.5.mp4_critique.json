    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively describes the man in the suit, providing clear details about his attire and the briefcase, its description of the second subject and their interaction could be improved. The term \"another individual\" is vague; if the person's features are obscured by the suit, it would be more accurate to describe it as \"a figure\" and explicitly mention that the suit, perhaps with a helmet and a reflective faceplate, conceals their identity. The description of the suit itself as just a \"full-body white protective suit\" is less detailed than the description of the man's clothing; adding attributes like a smooth, plastic-like texture or the presence of a breathing apparatus would create better parity. Furthermore, the spatial description feels static. Instead of placing one subject \"centrally\" and the other in the \"central midground,\" it would be more dynamic to describe their opposing movements in relation to each other, such as \"as the man in the suit walks away, a figure in a protective suit approaches from the distance along the same path,\" which better captures the likely visual of them passing one another in a corridor. This also makes the \"central\" positioning implicit and more natural.",

He is dressed in a tailored light blue suit jacket and matching trousers, paired with white shoes that feature dark soles. In his right hand, he carries a rigid, rectangular silver metallic briefcase, holding it by its handle at his side as he moves forward. As he walks away, a figure in a full-body white protective suit approaches from the distance along the same path. The suit, with a smooth, plastic-like texture, includes a helmet with a reflective faceplate that conceals the figure's identity, and a breathing apparatus is visible. The two subjects appear to be on a collision course, creating a dynamic visual of them passing one another in a corridor.",
