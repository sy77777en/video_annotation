    "pre_caption": "The video reveals a woman with light skin and long brown hair lying on her side, wearing a brown knitted sweater and a gray top with a white collar. She covers her mouth with one hand, her eyes wide open and looking upward. In the background, a man with short dark hair and light skin is partially visible, wearing a dark jacket and holding a flashlight, which casts light in the direction of the woman. The woman’s posture and the way she covers her mouth suggest she is trying to remain silent or hidden as the man’s presence becomes apparent.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on the caption is as follows: The final sentence, which interprets the woman's actions as an attempt to \"remain silent or hidden,\" should be removed as it introduces subjectivity and speculates on her motive, violating the core instructions. Instead of this interpretation, the caption could be strengthened by adding more precise, objective details about her physical state that might be visible in the video, such as her chest rising and falling rapidly or her eyes darting slightly, which would convey a sense of tension without using emotional language. The description of her position is vague; specifying that she is \"lying on a dark floor\" or \"crouching behind a sofa\" would provide crucial context. Furthermore, the description of her clothing, \"a gray top with a gray collar that has a white outline,\" is slightly cumbersome and could be streamlined to \"a gray collared shirt with white piping.\" While correctly identifying the other figures as \"indistinct,\" the caption could briefly mention their general form or movement, such as \"three tall, shadowy figures walking slowly in the background,\" to better paint the scene without making definitive claims about their identity.",
