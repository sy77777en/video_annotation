The long, uniform structure, with its countless balconies, stretches across the background under a flat, overcast sky. Lush green trees and dense foliage frame the building and line the banks of the dark, rippling water in the foreground. There is no main subject, as the composition emphasizes the scale of the man-made structure in contrast with the surrounding natural environment. The focus is on establishing a specific place and a quiet, slightly somber atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as a cityscape featuring a large building and a body of water, it could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions. The description uses subjective and emotive words such as \"tranquil,\" \"lush,\" and \"somber,\" which should be replaced with more objective, visual descriptors; for instance, instead of \"tranquil body of water,\" you could describe it as \"a still body of water with the building's reflection distorted by gentle ripples.\" The caption also misses potential salient details that would enhance its accuracy. For example, it fails to mention the building's material, which appears to be weathered grey concrete, or the fact that a few windows are illuminated with a warm yellow light, creating points of contrast against the otherwise dark facade. Furthermore, the final two sentences, which explain that there is no main subject and what the focus is, are meta-commentary. A stronger caption would convey this implicitly through its descriptive choices rather than explicitly stating the compositional intent. The description of the building as \"uniform\" is also an oversimplification, as it overlooks the subtle variations on the balconies, where some have green potted plants and others have clothes drying on racks, details that add a layer of realism to the scene.",
