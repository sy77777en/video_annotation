    "pre_caption": "This black-and-white video begins with a blurry, out-of-focus profile of a person set against the ocean. The shot slowly comes into focus to reveal a young boy in close-up. He is looking toward the left with his mouth slightly open. He wears a dark, textured cap over his dark hair, and there are a few smudges on his cheek. The collar of his dark garment appears to be ribbed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively captures the core action of the focus pull and provides a good baseline description of the boy, it misses several key visual details that would create a more vivid and accurate picture. The description of the boy's face is incomplete; beyond his mouth being \"slightly open,\" his overall expression is not mentioned. For instance, the video might show him with a neutral, pensive expression, with his eyes fixed on a point off-screen, which is a significant detail. The caption also completely omits the lighting, which could be a defining characteristic of the shot; a strong, high-contrast side light, for example, could be what makes the texture of the cap and the smudges on his cheek so prominent while casting the other side of his face in shadow. Furthermore, \"a few smudges on his cheek\" is vague; a more precise description might note a specific dark smudge of dirt under his left eye and another on his chin. Finally, while describing the focus change is good, the caption could be more dynamic by stating that the focus *shifts* from the distant, shimmering ocean to the boy, better conveying the deliberate cinematic transition that reveals him as the central subject.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The black-and-white video opens with a blurry, out-of-focus profile of a person set against the shimmering ocean. The focus shifts deliberately, bringing into view a young boy in close-up. He gazes pensively to the left, his mouth slightly open, with a neutral expression and eyes fixed on a point off-screen. A strong, high-contrast side light highlights the texture of his dark, textured cap and casts the other side of his face in shadow, accentuating a dark smudge of dirt under his left eye and another on his chin. The collar of his dark garment appears ribbed, adding to the textured visual.",
