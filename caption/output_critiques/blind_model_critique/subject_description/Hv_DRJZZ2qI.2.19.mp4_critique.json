    "pre_caption": "The main subject is a person on a mountain bike, captured mid-air while performing a jump across a wide gap in a rocky, canyon landscape. The biker is wearing a full-face helmet, a long-sleeved jersey that is dark blue with red and white accents on the chest and arms, and dark pants. The bicycle is dark in color. Several other people are visible in the scene, watching the event. On a ledge to the left, a man in a bright orange t-shirt and dark shorts stands observing. Other spectators are scattered on different ledges in the background and below the biker. To the right of the biker's path, a large blue flag with a Red Bull logo is planted on a pole.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject as a mountain biker mid-jump and notes key spectators and branding, it could be more visually evocative and detailed. The description of the bicycle as simply \"dark in color\" is too vague; I recall it being a matte black full-suspension downhill bike with prominent, thick, knobby tires and perhaps some neon green branding on the frame that is missed. The caption states the biker is \"performing a jump,\" but it fails to capture the specific action; in the video, the biker is in an aggressive, tucked position, body held low and parallel to the bike's frame, suggesting a focus on speed and stability rather than a stylistic trick. The description of the jersey is overly long and could be more concise. Furthermore, while the caption mentions a camera pan, it could describe the scene more immersively by simply stating the man in the orange shirt is \"on a ledge to the left\" without explicitly referencing the camera's movement. Finally, details that add to the atmosphere are missing, such as the Red Bull flag flapping vigorously in the wind and the fact that several of the distant spectators are holding up phones, clearly filming the event.",
