    "pre_caption": "A large, weathered cargo ship is positioned in what appears to be a dry dock. The ship's hull is dark, with a red stripe visible near the bottom. The upper deck and superstructure are painted white, showing signs of wear and grime. On the deck, there are several white, boxy and cylindrical structures, some of which are topped with red, mushroom-shaped vents. A large, flat, dark gray rectangular hatch cover occupies a central portion of the deck space. The ship is surrounded by scaffolding on one side.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good static description of the cargo ship, but it completely misses the sense of scale and the industrial activity that defines the scene. The video clearly shows several workers in orange high-visibility vests and white hard hats moving along the different levels of the scaffolding, their figures dwarfed by the ship's massive hull, which gives a powerful sense of its true size. The caption also fails to mention the active work being performed; for instance, the video includes a shot where sparks from a welding torch cascade down from an area on the bow, and another shot shows a crane lowering a large piece of equipment onto the deck. While the caption mentions \"wear and grime,\" it could be more specific by noting the prominent, thick rust streaks staining the white superstructure below the deck railings, a detail that is emphasized in a slow pan across the ship's side. Finally, the description of the hull as \"dark\" is too general; the video's lighting reveals it to be a faded navy blue, with large patches of reddish-brown primer indicating areas under repair.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A massive, weathered cargo ship dominates the dry dock, its faded navy blue hull towering over the scene and accentuated by large patches of reddish-brown primer indicating ongoing repairs. The ship's true scale is highlighted by several workers in orange high-visibility vests and white hard hats, who move along the scaffolding, their figures dwarfed by the colossal structure. The upper deck and superstructure, painted white, are marred by prominent, thick rust streaks below the deck railings, a detail captured in a slow pan across the ship's side. On the deck, white, boxy and cylindrical structures, some topped with red, mushroom-shaped vents, are visible alongside a large, flat, dark gray rectangular hatch cover. The scene is alive with industrial activity: sparks from a welding torch cascade down from the bow, and a crane is seen lowering a large piece of equipment onto the deck, adding to the dynamic atmosphere of the shipyard.",
