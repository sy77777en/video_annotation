    "pre_caption": "This video presents a scene from a 2D pixel-art video game, viewed from a top-down perspective. The main subject is a small player character with black hair, a white shirt, and blue pants. The character is shown placing a wooden bridge tile to connect a small ledge to a large, well-lit wooden platform built over dark water. This platform serves as a base and is filled with various pixelated objects, including a row of green storage chests, a larger silver and blue chest, a blue bed, a red bed, and several crafting stations that resemble a furnace, an anvil, and workbenches. The game's user interface is also visible, showing red, orange, and blue status bars in the top-left, a mini-map in the top-right, an inventory hotbar at the bottom, and controller button prompts in the bottom-right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the genre, perspective, and key subjects, it describes the scene as a static image rather than a video, missing crucial dynamic elements. For instance, the character doesn't simply \"place\" the tile; they perform an animation, swinging a small hammer which causes the bridge tile to appear with a brief particle effect. Immediately after, the character walks across the newly created bridge onto the main platform. The description of the environment could also be more specific; the \"dark water\" has subtle, animated ripples moving across its surface, and the \"well-lit\" platform is illuminated by two distinct, flickering torches mounted on posts, which are the clear sources of light. Furthermore, the UI description lacks context; the red health bar is slightly depleted, the orange stamina bar visibly decreases as the character performs the action, and the hotbar clearly shows the bridge tile is the selected item, highlighted by a glowing border. Finally, some objects have active states not mentioned, such as the furnace, which is visibly glowing from within and emitting faint smoke, indicating it is currently in use.",
