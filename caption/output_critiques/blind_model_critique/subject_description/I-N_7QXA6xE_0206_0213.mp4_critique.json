    "pre_caption": "This is a nature scenery shot set within a tranquil wooded area, with the camera positioned among several tree trunks looking out towards a more open, grassy space lined with distant trees. The video lacks a single main subject, as its primary purpose is to demonstrate a shallow depth of field, indicated by the \"f/3.5\" text on screen. The focus deliberately shifts from the background trees to the textured bark of the foreground trees, emphasizing the serene atmosphere and the visual interplay between different planes of the environment rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the core action of the video—a focus pull through a wooded area—but it relies on subjective and technical language forbidden by the instructions. Terms like \"serene,\" \"tranquil,\" and \"peaceful\" are emotional descriptors that should be omitted in favor of objective visual details. The description of the subjects is too generic; instead of just \"tree trunks,\" the caption should provide specific visual attributes, such as \"slender trees with white, peeling bark,\" \"a thick oak with gnarled, grey bark,\" or \"a dark, moss-covered trunk,\" to help the reader visualize the distinct subjects that come into focus. Furthermore, explaining that the \"f/3.5\" text \"indicates the use of a shallow depth of field\" is an analytical interpretation of a filmmaking technique, not a direct description of the visual content. The instruction is to describe what is visible, so the caption should simply state that text reading \"f/3.5\" appears on screen. The phrasing \"The focal plane then shifts\" is also overly technical; a more descriptive approach would be to describe the visual effect, such as \"the view transitions its focus from the midground trees to a closer tree,\" which better captures the experience without analyzing the mechanics.",

Text reading \"f/3.5\" appears on screen. The view transitions its focus from the midground trees to a closer tree, highlighting the visual details of the environment. The trees in the foreground include slender ones with white, peeling bark and a thick oak with gnarled, grey bark, providing distinct visual elements as the focus shifts.",
