    "pre_caption": "In this black-and-white video, a small, dark silhouette of a person is seen falling against a cloudy sky. The human-like figure, viewed from a great distance, tumbles as it descends, with its head, torso, and limbs visible in outline. The person disappears from view behind the dark silhouette of a house and trees located at the bottom of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **At the beginning, the frame shows only the sky. Then, a person falls from above into the frame, showing in an extreme wide shot, and the camera continuously tilts down, following the object’s descent. Finally, the object drops behind a house and disappears from the frame.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good, clear overview, but it could be more specific about the visual dynamics of the fall to create a more accurate mental picture. While it correctly notes the figure \"maintains a consistent orientation,\" it fails to describe what that orientation is—for example, if the figure is falling feet-first in a rigid posture or in a more splayed, stable position like a skydiver. The description of the movement itself is also vague; specifying the speed of the descent (e.g., \"descends at a slow, steady pace\" or \"plummets rapidly\") would be a crucial detail. Furthermore, the description of the environment, while correctly identified as a \"cloudy sky\" and \"silhouette of the houses,\" could be slightly more descriptive to enhance the context; for instance, mentioning if the sky is uniformly white or has visible cloud textures, and if the silhouette is of jagged rooftops or a flat horizon line. Finally, while stating the figure disappears behind the houses is correct, adding its location along the horizontal axis (e.g., \"disappears behind the rooftops near the center of the scene\") would provide a more complete description of the event's composition.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In this black-and-white video, a small, dark silhouette of a person is seen falling against a textured, cloudy sky. The human-like figure, viewed from a great distance, maintains a splayed, stable position similar to a skydiver, with its head, torso, and limbs clearly outlined. The figure descends at a slow, steady pace, adding a sense of calm to the scene. The sky features varying shades of gray with visible cloud textures, enhancing the dramatic backdrop. Below, the silhouette of jagged rooftops and trees creates a stark contrast against the sky. The person eventually disappears from view behind the rooftops near the center of the scene, completing the visual narrative.",
