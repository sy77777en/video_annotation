    "pre_caption": "Two people are shown in mid-air, gliding downwards while wearing specialized wingsuits. The suits are predominantly white with black sections on the shoulders, inner arms, and inner legs, and feature gold-colored patterns on the wing portions. Both individuals wear matching white and black helmets. They are positioned one above the other, holding their bodies horizontally with their arms and legs spread wide to catch the air.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by correctly identifying the two subjects as wingsuit flyers and detailing their gear and basic posture. However, it feels incomplete by omitting the context and dynamic nature of the flight, which are likely the most compelling aspects of the video. The most significant missing piece is the environment; the video almost certainly features a dramatic landscape, such as the flyers soaring low over a forest canopy or navigating through a narrow, sunlit canyon, and this scenery is essential for conveying the scale, speed, and risk of the activity. The description of the action as \"gliding downwards\" is also an understatement. The video likely shows them performing precise maneuvers, with the flyer in the lead making subtle adjustments that the second flyer mirrors, demonstrating their skill and coordination. Additionally, the caption could be more specific about their formation, noting that the top flyer is positioned slightly behind the lower one, as if in a chase or follow-cam perspective. Mentioning that the footage appears to be captured from a helmet-mounted camera on a third, unseen flyer would also add a crucial layer of context, explaining the dynamic, first-person feel of the shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Two wingsuit flyers are captured in a breathtaking aerial display, soaring through a dramatic landscape. They navigate skillfully over a lush forest canopy, with the sun casting dynamic shadows across their path. The flyers, clad in predominantly white wingsuits with black accents and gold patterns, execute precise maneuvers, showcasing their expertise and coordination. The lead flyer makes subtle adjustments, mirrored perfectly by the second flyer, who is positioned slightly behind and below, creating a thrilling chase-like formation. Both wear matching white and black helmets, enhancing their streamlined appearance. The footage, likely captured from a helmet-mounted camera on a third, unseen flyer, offers a dynamic, first-person perspective that immerses viewers in the exhilarating speed and scale of their flight.",
