    "pre_caption": "In a room with a sepia tint, a younger man and an older man stand over a large table, examining a map spread across it. The younger man, on the left, has dark hair and wears a dark suit, a white collared shirt with a dark tie, and a tall black top hat; he leans forward, pointing at a spot on the map. To his right, the older man, who has short white hair and also wears a dark suit, leans in to look at the map. In the background, another man in a dark suit stands with his back partially turned, and a fourth man is partially visible behind him.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively identifies the primary subjects and their general arrangement, but it describes the scene as a static image rather than a video, missing key dynamic elements and finer details. For instance, the caption states the younger man is \"pointing,\" but in the video, he is actually tracing a route on the map with his gloved finger, and the older man adjusts a pair of pince-nez glasses on his nose to follow the movement. The description of the map is too generic; it could be specified as a large, yellowed military map of a mountainous region, with red and blue pins marking specific locations. The caption also overlooks other objects on the table, such as a half-empty glass of whiskey and a lit cigar smoldering in a crystal ashtray, which add context to the scene. While the background men are mentioned, their actions are omitted; the third man is seen pacing slowly back and forth, and the fourth man, visible through a doorway, is handing a document to an unseen person. Finally, the \"sepia tint\" is a good observation, but the caption could also mention the dramatic, low-key lighting, with a single lamp casting long shadows that move as the characters shift their weight, enhancing the scene's conspiratorial atmosphere.",
