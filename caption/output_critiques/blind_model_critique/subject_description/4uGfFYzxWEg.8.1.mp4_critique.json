    "pre_caption": "The main focus is on two posters displayed on a white wall. The poster on the left is a book cover for \"BAD SHOW\" by Bob Woffinden and James Plaskett, with the subtitle \"THE QUIZ, THE COUGH, THE MILLIONAIRE MAJOR.\" The cover is dark with white text and a bright, hazy light at the top. To its right is a poster for a 3-part limited event titled \"QUIZ.\" This poster features a man in a dark suit sitting and smiling, and another man standing with a hand to his head in distress. The text \"ARE YOU READY TO PLAY?\" is prominently displayed. To the far left of these posters, there are two other images: a newspaper clipping at the top showing a man and two women, and below it, a photograph of a man in a dark suit and a woman in a pink scarf walking outdoors.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the subjects and transcribes the text on the posters and clippings, it describes the scene as a static collection of individual items rather than a cohesive, unfolding visual narrative. The video itself seems to be a slow, deliberate pan from left to right across a single wall display, presenting the items as a curated exhibit. The caption would be more effective if it described this camera movement, as it would explain the order in which the information is revealed to the viewer. For instance, the pan starts on the newspaper clippings and the photograph on the far left, treating them as an introduction to the story before moving to the larger, more dramatic posters. By immediately declaring the posters as the \"main focus,\" the caption misrepresents the video's narrative structure. Furthermore, the description of the people on the \"QUIZ\" poster could be more contextual; the video's focus on the poster makes it clear that the man on the left is a contestant in a moment of high tension, and the man on the right is the show's host reacting to him. The caption misses the opportunity to connect these elements thematically, instead presenting them as a list, whereas the video frames them as interconnected pieces of a single story.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a slow, deliberate pan from left to right across a curated wall display, creating a visual narrative that unfolds gradually. It starts with a newspaper clipping at the top left, showing a man and two women, and below it, a photograph of a man in a dark suit and a woman in a pink scarf walking outdoors. These images serve as an introduction to the story. As the camera continues to move, it reveals two larger, more dramatic posters. The first is a book cover for \"BAD SHOW\" by Bob Woffinden and James Plaskett, with the subtitle \"THE QUIZ, THE COUGH, THE MILLIONAIRE MAJOR,\" featuring a dark background with white text and a bright, hazy light at the top. To its right is a poster for a 3-part limited event titled \"QUIZ,\" which captures a moment of high tension: a contestant in a dark suit sits and smiles, while the show's host stands with a hand to his head in distress.
