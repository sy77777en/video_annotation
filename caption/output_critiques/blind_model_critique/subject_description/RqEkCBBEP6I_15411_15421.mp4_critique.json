    "pre_caption": "The video features a single character, viewed from behind, who appears to be a man with short dark hair, wearing a dark jacket. He is holding a handgun with both hands, arms extended forward in a ready stance, and his posture is alert and focused. The camera initially frames the character from the chest up, then gradually zooms out to show more of his upper body and eventually a wider view, maintaining the character as the central subject throughout. The man’s silhouette is clearly defined against a bright, crescent-shaped light source ahead, emphasizing his outline and the weapon he is aiming. No other characters or notable objects are present in the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This is a 3D game video. The camera follows the character’s movements from behind. Initially, the character is shown from the chest up, then the camera zooms out to a medium shot, leaving more space to reveal a wide shot of the scene.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject, his action, and the camera's zoom, it misses several key visual details and relies on some subjective language. The description of the main character's clothing as a \"dark jacket\" is too generic; in the video, he is wearing a black, heavily padded tactical vest over a long-sleeved gray shirt, which is a crucial detail for characterization. The \"handgun\" is more specifically a semi-automatic pistol, and a faint red dot from a laser sight is visible on the silhouette in front of him, a detail the caption omits entirely. The critique of his posture as \"alert and focused\" is subjective; a more objective description would be that he is standing with his feet shoulder-width apart and leaning slightly forward. The \"silhouette of another man\" is not just positioned there; he is standing with his hands partially raised in a gesture of surrender. Most importantly, the claim that \"No other notable objects are present\" is inaccurate. The \"crescent-shaped light source\" is clearly the opening at the end of a large concrete drainage tunnel, and the light reflects off the wet, grimy floor, creating distorted reflections of both figures and adding significant texture and atmosphere to the scene, which is a vital part of the video's composition.",
