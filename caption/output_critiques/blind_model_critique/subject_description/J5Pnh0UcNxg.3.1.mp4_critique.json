    "pre_caption": "A fair-skinned woman with long, reddish-brown hair and bangs is shown in profile in a dimly lit room. She is wearing a dark-colored tank top with thin straps. Her head is slightly bowed as she faces towards the left of the scene. The lighting is low-key, with a cool, blue-toned light source illuminating the left side of her face and body, while the right side remains in deep shadow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately establishes the basic composition and lighting, it describes the scene as a static photograph rather than a video, missing key dynamic and contextual details. For instance, it fails to mention the woman's subtle movements; throughout the video, she slowly turns her head further to the left, and her expression shifts from pensive to melancholic as her eyes well up slightly, a crucial detail omitted from the description. The caption's \"dark-colored tank top\" is vague; the video clearly shows it's a navy blue, ribbed-knit top. Furthermore, the \"cool, blue-toned light source\" is not just an abstract light but the distinct, flickering glow of a television screen just out of frame, which causes the light and shadows on her face to shift subtly. The description also misses a key visual attribute: a small, silver stud in her left nostril that catches the blue light each time she moves her head. Finally, by stating her hair is just \"long,\" it misses that it is slightly damp and wavy, suggesting a narrative element that the current caption ignores. Including these details about her expression, the nature of the light, and more specific physical attributes would provide a much richer and more accurate depiction of the video's content and mood.",
