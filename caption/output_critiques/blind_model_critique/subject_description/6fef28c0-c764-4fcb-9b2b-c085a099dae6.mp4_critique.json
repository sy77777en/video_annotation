    "pre_caption": "The video reveals three people standing together, their forms blurred by motion. The sequence begins with their reflections on a polished surface before tilting up to their bodies. On the left stands a woman with dark skin wearing a dark, sleeveless gown. In the center is a person with a lighter complexion dressed in a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt and matching trousers. To the right, another person with a lighter complexion wears a white collared shirt, a dark vest, and dark trousers. All three individuals are holding champagne flutes.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The camera first captures the reflection of three people on the floor in a full shot, then tilts up to reveal their bodies, presenting a medium-full shot of them at the end.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively describes the sequence of the reveal and the basic composition of the scene, it could be improved by adding more specific visual details and clarifying ambiguities. The use of \"person\" for the central and right-hand figures is appropriate if their gender is unclear, but if the video clearly shows them to be, for example, a woman in a light-colored jumpsuit and a male server, using \"woman\" and \"man\" would be more precise as per the instructions. The description of their appearance could be enhanced with likely visible details such as the hairstyle of the woman on the left (e.g., \"black hair styled in an updo\") or the specific style of the central person's attire. Furthermore, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the subjects' poses and interactions; for instance, it could note if the woman and the central figure are turned towards each other and smiling, which would add significant context. Finally, the phrase \"blurred by motion\" is vague; it would be more informative to specify whether the blur originates from the subjects' own movements, like dancing, or from the camera's upward tilt, as this detail changes the feel of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video reveals three people standing together, their forms slightly blurred by the camera's upward tilt. The sequence begins with their reflections on a polished surface before tilting up to their bodies. On the left stands a woman with dark skin, her black hair styled in an elegant updo, wearing a dark, sleeveless gown. In the center is a woman with a lighter complexion dressed in a light-colored jumpsuit, her hair cascading in loose waves. To the right, a man with a lighter complexion wears a white collared shirt, a dark vest, and dark trousers, resembling a server. All three individuals are holding champagne flutes.
