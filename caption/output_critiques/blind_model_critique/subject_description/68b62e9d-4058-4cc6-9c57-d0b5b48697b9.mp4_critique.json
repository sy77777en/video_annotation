    "pre_caption": "From a top-down perspective, a person lies on their back in the center of the scene, serving as the main subject. This individual wears a dark jacket over a red and black patterned top, light blue shorts over dark leggings, and black boots. Two other people move in a circle around the central figure. One person, dressed in dark pants and a top, holds a long, flowing, rainbow-colored ribbon. The other person is dressed in a white costume with ruffles and wears a bright red hat.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption successfully establishes the top-down perspective and correctly identifies the three subjects and their primary actions, it misses crucial details required by the instructions, particularly regarding the physical attributes of the people. The description uses the generic term \"person\" and \"individual\" without providing any information on their apparent gender, age, skin tone, or hairstyle, all of which are visible in the video and are essential for a complete subject description. For instance, the central figure is a young man with fair skin and short, dark hair, while the two moving figures are women, one with a long blonde ponytail and the other with dark hair tied in a bun under her beret. Furthermore, some descriptions could be more precise; the \"dark top with red and white embellishments\" is actually a black t-shirt with a small, square logo on the left chest, and the \"yellow fabric visible above\" the light blue shorts is the exposed yellow waistband of his boxer briefs. The description of the moving subjects, while accurate, could also better capture the dynamic interplay; instead of just running and spinning, they are performing a choreographed dance, moving in a circular pattern around the static man, with the woman in green trousers waving the large, wing-like rainbow silk poi in flowing arcs above him.",
