    "pre_caption": "This video is a garden scenery shot that reveals a small, man-made waterfall. The scene transitions from a soft blur to a sharp focus, showing water cascading over a wall of large, grey and brown rocks, with a bed of smaller, smooth pebbles separating the rockery from a vibrant green lawn. There is no single main subject, as the focus pull technique is employed to showcase the entire environment. This method emphasizes the tranquil atmosphere and detailed texture of the rock garden and water feature as a complete composition, rather than isolating a specific element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption uses forbidden technical jargon like \"shallow depth of field\" and \"rack focus,\" and meta-commentary such as \"This method emphasizes,\" instead of simply describing the visual experience. It also includes the prohibited word \"frame\" and subjective language like \"tranquil atmosphere.\" The description of the subjects is too general; for example, the \"black table\" I saw was a polished, dark wood with a visible grain, and the caption fails to mention the white foam of the water as it splashes onto the rocks or the small, purple wildflowers growing in the grass next to the pebble bed. Furthermore, the structure is confusing because it describes the focus shifting to the waterfall and then states \"The scene transitions to show water cascading,\" which makes it sound like two separate events rather than a single, continuous rack focus revealing the final scene. A more effective description would narrate the visual change by stating that a blurry background of a rock garden with a waterfall gradually comes into sharp focus, revealing its details, while a foreground table becomes blurred.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a blurry view of a rock garden featuring a waterfall. As the scene gradually comes into sharp focus, the details of the garden are revealed: water cascades over large grey and brown rocks, creating white foam as it splashes. A bed of smaller, smooth pebbles separates the rockery from a vibrant green lawn, where small purple wildflowers grow. In the foreground, a polished dark wood table with visible grain becomes blurred, enhancing the depth of the scene. The overall composition highlights the intricate textures and natural beauty of the garden.",
