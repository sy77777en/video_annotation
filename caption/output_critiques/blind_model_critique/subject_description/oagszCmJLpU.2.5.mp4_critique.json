    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic skyscape scenery shot of a powerful thunderstorm raging at night. There is no single main subject because the focus is on capturing the immense scale and raw energy of the atmospheric event itself. The vast, dark sky is dominated by a colossal, churning mass of storm clouds, so dark they are nearly black. The scene is intermittently and violently illuminated by flashes of lightning; some are sharp, branching bolts that crackle low on the horizon, while others are diffuse sheet lightning that lights up the interior of the clouds, casting an ominous and beautiful purple glow across the turbulent cloudscape. A few faint, distant lights twinkle along the dark, flat horizon, providing a subtle sense of scale against the overwhelming power of the storm above.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot of a nighttime thunderstorm, it contains several inaccuracies and misses key visual details from the footage. The description relies heavily on subjective adjectives like \"dramatic,\" \"powerful,\" \"ominous,\" and \"beautiful,\" which violates the instruction to avoid emotional language. A more objective description of the lightning's intensity and the clouds' density would be more effective. The caption states the sheet lightning casts a \"purple glow,\" but the video clearly shows the flashes are predominantly a stark, brilliant white, with occasional hints of electric blue, not purple. Furthermore, the horizon is not entirely \"flat\"; a distinct, jagged silhouette of a distant mountain range is visible during the brighter lightning flashes, a crucial detail for establishing the location and scale that the caption omits. Finally, the description of the lightning could be more specific; while it mentions bolts and sheet lightning, it fails to capture the rapid, almost strobe-like frequency of the flashes in the video or the complex, web-like patterns of spider lightning that crawl horizontally across the underbelly of the main cloud mass. Replacing the subjective terms and adding these specific details about the lightning's color, the horizon's features, and the flash frequency would create a more accurate and faithful description of the visual content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a nighttime thunderstorm, showcasing the vast scale and intensity of the atmospheric event. The dark sky is filled with dense storm clouds, nearly black in appearance. The scene is frequently illuminated by intense flashes of lightning, predominantly stark white with occasional hints of electric blue. Some lightning forms sharp, branching bolts near the horizon, while others create complex, web-like patterns of spider lightning that crawl horizontally across the clouds. The lightning flashes with a rapid, strobe-like frequency, highlighting the jagged silhouette of a distant mountain range on the horizon, which provides a sense of location and scale. A few faint lights twinkle in the distance, contrasting with the overwhelming power of the storm above.",
