    "pre_caption": "The video opens on several white doves flying in the upper left portion of the scene, set against a background of dense, green trees. The camera then pans down and to the right, revealing a young man with fair skin and short, dark hair. He is wearing a blue and grey long-sleeved shirt and blue jeans while standing on a skateboard beside a rectangular swimming pool filled with turquoise water. The pool area is enclosed by a high, light-colored wall partially covered with ivy. In the background, a faint rainbow arc is visible in the air, likely from a sprinkler.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good sequential overview, but it could be enhanced with more specific visual details to improve accuracy and vividness. The description of the man is a good start, but it could specify his approximate age, such as \"late teens or early twenties,\" and the style of his \"black and gray long-sleeved shirt,\" for instance, whether it's striped, color-blocked, or has a graphic. His orientation is missing; clarifying if he is looking at the camera, into the pool, or down at his board would add important context. The skateboard itself is a key object that could be described further—is it a longboard or a standard deck, and does it have a noticeable color or graphic? The term \"fishing net\" is likely inaccurate for the setting; \"pool skimmer\" or \"leaf net\" would be more precise, and describing its appearance (e.g., a flat mesh on a long pole) would resolve the ambiguity. For the person holding it, even if they are partially visible, the caption could mention any discernible features like the color of their sleeve or if it's just a hand and arm that are visible. Finally, the location of the \"faint rainbow arc\" in relation to the man—whether it's behind him, to his side, or in front of him—is a compositional detail that would help in visualizing the scene more clearly.",

The camera then pans down and to the right, revealing a young man in his late teens or early twenties with fair skin and short, dark hair. He is wearing a color-blocked blue and grey long-sleeved shirt and blue jeans while standing on a standard skateboard beside a rectangular swimming pool filled with turquoise water. The man is looking down at his board. The skateboard has a vibrant red deck with a graphic design. The pool area is enclosed by a high, light-colored wall partially covered with ivy. A person, partially visible, is holding a pool skimmer with a flat mesh on a long pole; only their hand and a sleeve of a red shirt are visible.
