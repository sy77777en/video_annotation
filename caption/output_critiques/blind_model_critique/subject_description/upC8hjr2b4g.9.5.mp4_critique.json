    "pre_caption": "The video features two stylized, human-like figures in a room. In the foreground, a mannequin-like figure with a pale, featureless face and short, dark hair lies on its back on a black chaise lounge. This figure is dressed in a light blue t-shirt and dark shorts. Seated opposite in a brown, modern-style chair is a more abstract, sculptural figure. This second figure is rendered in a low-polygon style, composed entirely of light gray geometric facets, and sits with its legs crossed, turned towards the figure on the lounge in an attentive posture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the two main subjects and their general appearance, but it overlooks several key visual details that are prominent in the video. The \"mannequin-like figure\" is described as having a \"pale, featureless face,\" but in the video, its face has a distinct, smooth porcelain texture with subtle, shallow indentations for closed eyes, which is a more specific and important attribute than just being \"featureless.\" The description of the second, \"low-polygon\" figure is good, but it completely omits the dramatic lighting; the video features a single, harsh light source from the side that casts long, sharp shadows and creates bright, specular highlights on its \"light gray geometric facets,\" a crucial element that defines its form and the scene's mood. The phrase \"attentive posture\" is subjective and violates the instruction to avoid emotional descriptors; a more objective description would be that its upper torso is rotated forty-five degrees toward the other figure. Lastly, the caption misses a subtle but important action: while the figure on the bed is static, the faceted figure's head slowly and mechanically rotates to face it over the course of the video, suggesting a relationship or observation that is central to the scene.",
