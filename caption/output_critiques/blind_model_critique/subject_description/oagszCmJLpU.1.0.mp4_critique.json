    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a vast, open plain under an immense and ominous storm system. The sky is dominated by a heavy, dark blanket of turbulent clouds, ranging from deep charcoal grey at the top to lighter, churning formations below, with a curtain of distant rain obscuring the horizon. The flat, arid ground, covered in sparse, brownish vegetation, stretches across the bottom of the frame, accentuating the sheer scale of the weather above. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the powerful, foreboding atmosphere and the dramatic interplay between the dark sky and the wide-open land.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the video as a landscape scenery shot and captures the general essence of the storm, it misses several key dynamic and visual details present in the video. The description of \"turbulent clouds\" is too static; it fails to mention the visible time-lapse motion where the massive supercell cloud system rotates slowly in the upper atmosphere while lower cloud layers scud rapidly from right to left. The caption also omits the intermittent flashes of intra-cloud lightning that briefly illuminate the dense, dark grey cloud mass from within, creating a dramatic strobing effect. Furthermore, while correctly noting the absence of a main subject, it overlooks a significant compositional element: a weathered wooden fence line that runs diagonally from the lower-left corner into the midground, its posts silhouetted against the arid plain, which helps to establish a sense of depth and scale that the current description lacks. Finally, the use of subjective words like \"ominous\" and \"foreboding\" could be replaced with more objective descriptions of the deep, purple and grey tones of the clouds and the stark, low-contrast light across the landscape to better adhere to the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a dynamic landscape scene featuring a vast, open plain beneath a massive storm system. The sky is filled with a rotating supercell cloud formation, with upper layers swirling slowly while lower clouds scud rapidly from right to left. Intermittent flashes of intra-cloud lightning illuminate the dense, dark grey clouds, creating a dramatic strobing effect. The flat, arid ground, covered in sparse, brownish vegetation, stretches across the bottom of the frame, accentuating the scale of the weather above. A weathered wooden fence line runs diagonally from the lower-left corner into the midground, its posts silhouetted against the plain, adding depth and scale to the scene. The deep purple and grey tones of the clouds and the stark, low-contrast light across the landscape highlight the powerful atmosphere and the dramatic interplay between the sky and the land.",
