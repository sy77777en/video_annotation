    "pre_caption": "The video opens on a close-up of a faceless animated figure with pale, featureless skin. The figure has short, textured brown hair styled with a side part and is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved t-shirt. The camera then follows the figure's head as it turns to the right, revealing a black computer monitor. The monitor, which has the brand name \"TELESONIC\" on its lower bezel, displays a green-tinted screen with a white-outlined login window containing fields for a \"UserID\" and \"Password.\" The side of the faceless figure's head remains in view on the left, looking toward the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately describes the main subjects and camera movements, it omits several key visual details that would provide a more complete picture of the scene. For instance, it fails to mention that the animated figure is sitting hunched over a dark-colored desk, which establishes the relationship between the figure and the monitor. The description of the t-shirt as \"light-colored\" is too vague; it is clearly an off-white or pale gray. Similarly, the \"textured brown hair\" could be more specifically described as having a low-poly, blocky texture, which is a defining characteristic of the animation style. The caption also misses a crucial detail on the computer monitor: a solid white cursor blinking steadily in the \"UserID\" field, drawing the viewer's focus. Furthermore, the description of the camera work could be enhanced; the arc is slow and smooth, and the pan to the monitor is accompanied by a subtle rack focus that shifts sharpness from the figure's shoulder to the screen. Finally, the caption neglects to describe the lighting; the primary light source is the monitor itself, which casts a distinct green glow on the right side of the figure's face and torso, a detail that is objective and central to the scene's atmosphere.",
