    "pre_caption": "A metallic, circular object, identified as an astrolabe, is shown. It has a gold or brass-like appearance and features a small loop at the top for suspension. The front face is intricate, with a rotating pointer, or alidade, pivoted at the center. This face has complex cut-outs with scalloped, cloud-like edges, revealing a plate with grid-like markings underneath. The back of the astrolabe is simpler, featuring a different set of crossed arms. Throughout the sequence, the object is seen in both its metallic gold color and also bathed in a red light, giving it a solid red appearance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption successfully identifies the central subject as an astrolabe and describes its front and back faces, but it lacks specificity and dynamic detail that would be present in the video. For instance, while it mentions a \"rotating pointer,\" it fails to state that the video actually shows this alidade moving across the underlying plate, a key action demonstrating the object's function. The description of the markings as \"grid-like\" is vague; the video likely provides a clear enough view to describe them more accurately as \"engraved concentric circles and radiating lines.\" Furthermore, the caption notes the change in lighting but doesn't describe the transition itself; it could be improved by stating that the light shifts from a neutral, even illumination to a dramatic, directional red light that casts deep shadows and highlights the metallic texture. Finally, the description omits any mention of how the object is presented; if the astrolabe is being held by a hand, possibly in a leather glove, this is a significant contextual detail that grounds the object and should be included.",
