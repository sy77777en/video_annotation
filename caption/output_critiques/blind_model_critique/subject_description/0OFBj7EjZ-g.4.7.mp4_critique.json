    "pre_caption": "This computer-generated video features a central device composed of a wide, light-gray circular base and a matching circular top. A narrower, glowing turquoise cylinder connects the base and top. A transparent, cylindrical shell encasing the turquoise column shatters into numerous small, sharp-edged fragments that float around the device. Following this, two long, thin, vertically oriented rectangular pieces, made of the same transparent material, appear to the right of the central structure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video is computer-generated. In the center of the frame, there is a cylindrical-like device that simulates the process of partial glass repair; finally, it produces two pieces of glass on the right side of the frame.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Your description effectively captures the core reverse-time assembly sequence and identifies the main components of the object. However, it could be improved by adding more specific visual details and refining the language for better flow. The caption misses the opportunity to describe the interplay of light, a key visual element in a scene with a \"glowing\" object. For instance, you could mention how the turquoise light from the central column refracts through the \"transparent shards\" as they fly into place, making them shimmer with color. The description of the \"light-gray circular base and top\" could be more specific by noting their texture, such as a matte or brushed-metal finish, which would contrast with the smooth, transparent shell. Furthermore, the phrase \"appear to the right\" for the two rectangular pieces is vague; specifying how they appear—whether they also assemble from fragments, fade in, or slide into frame—would create a more complete picture. Finally, stating \"The video, presented in reverse\" at the beginning feels like an interpretation rather than a direct observation. A more dynamic approach would be to describe the action as it happens on screen, such as \"Numerous small, sharp-edged transparent shards converge from outside the frame,\" allowing the reverse-motion effect to be understood through the description of the impossible action itself.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Numerous small, sharp-edged transparent shards converge from outside the frame, drawn towards a central device. This device features a wide, light-gray circular base and a matching top, both with a brushed-metal finish that contrasts with the smooth, transparent shell. A narrower, glowing turquoise cylinder connects the base and top, casting a vibrant light that refracts through the converging shards, making them shimmer with color. As the shards assemble into a transparent, cylindrical shell around the turquoise column, two long, thin, vertically oriented rectangular pieces, made of the same transparent material, slide into frame from the right, completing the structure.",
