    "pre_caption": "A light-skinned, middle-aged man with short, light-brown hair is shown from the chest up against a dark background. He wears a dark suit jacket, a grey collared shirt, and a dark tie. His expression is serious and contemplative, with his lips pursed as he looks slightly to his left. Below him, a blue and white graphic displays a multiple-choice question from the game show \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\". The question reads, \"Who was the second husband of Jacqueline Kennedy?\", with the options listed as A: Adnan Khashoggi, B: Ronald Reagan, C: Aristotle Onassis, and D: Rupert Murdoch. Text in the top left corner indicates the show is from 2001.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately describes the contestant and the question on the screen, it treats the video as a static image, missing key dynamic elements. For instance, it describes the man's expression as \"serious and contemplative,\" which is subjective, and his gaze as fixed, whereas the video likely shows his expression shifting as he thinks, perhaps with his eyes moving between an off-screen host and a monitor. The caption also completely omits the host, a crucial second subject who would likely appear in separate shots or a two-shot, interacting with the contestant. Furthermore, the description of the multiple-choice graphic is static; the video probably shows this graphic animating onto the screen, and potentially an option lighting up to indicate the contestant's choice or the correct answer, which is a critical part of the narrative. Finally, the caption fails to mention any shot transitions, such as cuts between the contestant's close-up and a reaction shot of the host, which are fundamental to the show's format and essential for a complete video description.",
