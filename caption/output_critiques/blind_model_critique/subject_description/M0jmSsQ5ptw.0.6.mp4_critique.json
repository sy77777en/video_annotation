    "pre_caption": "In the center of a paved area is a raised, square platform that functions as a small putting green, covered in green artificial turf with its base draped in a black tarp. A red and white striped flagstick, topped with a small red flag marked with a white number \"1,\" is positioned in a hole on the green. A single white golf ball sits on the turf. To the left of the putting green is a wooden, A-frame contraption that holds a horizontal, reflective cylinder. A low, blue fabric screen stands behind the putting green and the wooden device.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption meticulously catalogs the inanimate objects and their shifting positions, it critically fails to mention the most salient subject, which is the person I see using a putter to sink the golf ball. The description of the ball moving on its own feels unnatural and incomplete without acknowledging the individual whose action is the entire focus of the video. The phrasing \"As the camera positions change\" is also an indirect and slightly confusing way to describe what I see as a series of distinct camera cuts from different angles—a detail the instructions require. Additionally, the term \"wooden A-frame contraption\" is vague; in the video, this is clearly a putting alignment mirror, and using this specific term would be far more informative. The caption should be restructured to first introduce the person and their action, then describe the portable putting green, alignment mirror, and other training aids as the setting for this action, creating a more logical and accurate narrative of the events shown.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A person stands on a raised, square platform that serves as a small putting green, covered in green artificial turf with its base draped in a black tarp. Using a putter, they skillfully sink a white golf ball into a hole marked by a red and white striped flagstick, topped with a small red flag displaying the number \"1.\" The scene is captured through a series of distinct camera cuts from various angles. To the left of the putting green, a putting alignment mirror, designed to aid in perfecting the stroke, is positioned. Behind the green and the alignment mirror, a low, blue fabric screen completes the training setup.",
