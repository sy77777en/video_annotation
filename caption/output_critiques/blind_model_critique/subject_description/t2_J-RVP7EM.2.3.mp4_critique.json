    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot that slowly zooms out to reveal a detailed cross-section of a vast, multi-level building. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and intricate, symmetrical design of the structure, creating a formal and imposing atmosphere. The dimly lit interior shows numerous rooms across several floors, including various auditoriums with white or blue tiered seating, and a central, wood-paneled chamber containing an altar-like table. At the bottom level, a large hall features a mural and two simple benches. As the camera pulls back, the building's stark, fortress-like exterior is revealed, reinforcing the sense of a grand and sterile institution.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption successfully identifies the video as an architectural scenery shot and explains the lack of a main subject, but it misses opportunities for greater visual specificity. While it mentions a \"mural\" and an \"altar-like table,\" it fails to describe their distinct features; the mural could be a faded, monochromatic fresco depicting industrial machinery, and the table could be a solid, unadorned block of dark granite, details that would enhance the \"imposing atmosphere.\" The description relies on interpretive adjectives like \"sterile\" and \"formal\" instead of describing the visual elements that create this feeling, such as the polished concrete floors that reflect the stark, cool light from unseen sources or the complete absence of any personal items or decorations in the rooms. Additionally, the description of the zoom-out is vague; it could be improved by specifying that the camera pulls back through the opposite wall, revealing the cross-section as if it were a dollhouse, before the building's full, windowless concrete exterior fills the view, which would better explain how the \"fortress-like\" nature is revealed.",
