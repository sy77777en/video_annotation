    "pre_caption": "An overhead shot shows a person with dark, short hair and pale skin, wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt. The person is seated at a wooden desk, looking down at a collection of documents. Their hands are placed on either side of a rectangular paper map that lies in the center of the desk. As the scene comes into focus, the map is revealed to have black lines depicting borders and topography, with the word \"MANCHURIA\" visible at the top. To the left of the map are several sheets of paper with printed text, while a stack of papers sits to the right. Near the top of the desk, two books are stacked, one with a tan cover on top of another with a reddish-brown cover. The desk is illuminated by a single, bright light source from above.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a close-up shot capturing the top half of a man's head and the papers on the desk in front of him. Initially, everything is out of focus. As the camera is lifted, the papers on the desk gradually come into focus.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows. The description of the shot as both \"high-angle\" and \"eye-level\" is contradictory; the scene, as viewed, is a distinct high-angle or overhead shot, looking down onto the desk, which makes the \"eye-level\" descriptor inaccurate. While the caption identifies \"a person,\" the video provides enough visual information—such as the subject's build, hands, and hairline—to identify them as a man, likely middle-aged, and this specificity should be included. The caption accurately notes the initial focus pull but could be more descriptive; it's a slow rack focus that deliberately shifts from the man's hands to the crisp details of the map, making \"MANCHURIA\" the clear focal point. Furthermore, the description of the lighting as a \"single, bright light source\" is correct but misses the atmospheric quality it creates; the light is harsh and focused, casting deep shadows around the desk and suggesting a late-night, intense work session. Finally, while the documents are mentioned, key details are omitted: the map paper is visibly aged and yellowed, and several of the surrounding papers contain not just printed text but also handwritten annotations in ink, with a black fountain pen resting beside them, details which are crucial for establishing the scene's time period and tone.",
