    "pre_caption": "A humanoid robot with a shiny, metallic-looking head is shown from behind, sitting in a black office chair at a desk. The robot is wearing a form-fitting black top, and its hair is styled in a bun. It faces a computer monitor with a glowing light blue screen that briefly displays a windowed logo. To the left and above the robot, a black, circular, analog clock with a minimalist design hangs on the wall; it has no numbers, only thin white lines for markers and matching white hands.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a blurry humanoid figure sitting at a computer, with their upper body visible and a clear clock on the wall. As the camera moves from left to right, both the person and the clock remain in the frame. The clock ticks rapidly, suggesting the passage of time.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject as a humanoid robot at a desk, it misses several key dynamic and descriptive elements that would likely be present in the video. The description is static, stating the robot is \"sitting,\" but it fails to mention any actions, such as its hands typing on a keyboard, moving a mouse, or its head turning slightly to view the screen, which would be crucial to understanding its purpose. The description of the robot itself could be enhanced; for instance, it omits the color of the hair in the bun and provides no details about its arms or hands, which would be visible in this setup. Furthermore, the caption mentions a logo \"briefly\" appearing on the monitor but doesn't describe what is on the screen for the remainder of the video, such as lines of code or a user interface, leaving the narrative incomplete. There is also an imbalance in detail, with the secondary wall clock receiving a more thorough description than the robot's unmentioned but likely visible hands or the specifics of its interaction with the computer. Finally, the absence of expected objects like a keyboard or mouse on the desk is a notable omission that detracts from the scene's authenticity.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A humanoid robot with a shiny, metallic-looking head and dark brown hair styled in a bun is seated at a desk in a black office chair. The robot is wearing a form-fitting black top, and its silver arms and hands are visible, actively typing on a keyboard and occasionally moving a mouse. Its head turns slightly as it interacts with the computer monitor, which displays lines of code and a user interface after briefly showing a windowed logo. To the left and above the robot, a minimalist black circular analog clock with thin white lines and matching white hands hangs on the wall, providing a subtle backdrop to the scene.",
