    "pre_caption": "From a high, top-down perspective, four people are clustered together in the center, looking up. One is a light-skinned woman with long, curly, reddish-brown hair, wearing sunglasses, a red jacket, and a black top. To her right is a person with a darker skin tone and short, dark, curly hair, wearing a shiny red jacket over a black top. Above them, another light-skinned person with curly, reddish-brown hair wears a shiny red jacket. The fourth individual is light-skinned with short, dark hair and is dressed in a black jacket over a red top. Surrounding this group are four large, rectangular signs with white text. A red sign at the bottom reads \"GRAND OPENING,\" a purple sign on the right says \"WELCOME,\" a green sign at the top reads \"SHOP LOCAL,\" and a yellow-orange sign on the left says \"WE'RE OPEN.\"",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the bird's-eye perspective and the main subjects, it could be improved for clarity and detail. The description of the people is repetitive; referring to \"the light-skinned woman with long, reddish-brown curly hair\" multiple times is cumbersome and could be streamlined by establishing a simpler identifier after the initial description. The description of the second person's attire as a \"black and shiny red top over a black top\" is confusing; it would be clearer to specify if it's a single patterned garment or, for instance, a \"shiny red vest over a black shirt.\" The caption also misses likely visual cues that provide context; given the promotional signs, the people are probably smiling or looking upward with excited expressions, which are objective details that should be included. Furthermore, the description of the signs \"gradually shifting positions\" is a bit abstract; it would be more concrete to state that the camera orbits the stationary group, revealing the four signs arranged on the ground around them. Lastly, identifying two separate individuals as a \"light-skinned person with curly, reddish-brown hair\" creates ambiguity; distinguishing them by other visible attributes, such as gender or a more specific hairstyle, would make each subject easier to identify.",
