    "pre_caption": "A woman with brown skin and dark hair pulled back into a ponytail is shown running.

The video captures her from a rear and side perspective as she is in motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by accurately identifying the woman and her athletic clothing, particularly the specific colors of her shoes. However, it could be significantly improved by incorporating more contextual and dynamic details from the video. For instance, the description completely omits the setting; the video clearly shows her running on a paved path through a green, sunlit park, a detail that adds important context to her activity. The caption also misses key attributes of the subject herself, such as her estimated age (she appears to be in her late 20s) and the fact that she is wearing a black fitness tracker on her left wrist and white wireless earbuds. Furthermore, the description of the video's composition is too simplistic. It fails to mention that the video frequently cuts between the side and rear angles and incorporates several slow-motion sequences that emphasize the powerful stride of her running form. A more comprehensive caption would integrate these elements, perhaps starting with the setting and then describing the woman's action and appearance, including the shot transitions, to create a more complete and vivid picture of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a sunlit park with lush greenery, a woman in her late 20s is captured running along a paved path. She has brown skin and dark hair pulled back into a ponytail, and she is dressed in athletic attire: a form-fitting, long-sleeved grey shirt with thumbholes, short black athletic shorts, and vibrant orange and purple running shoes. On her left wrist, she wears a black fitness tracker, and white wireless earbuds are visible in her ears. The video dynamically shifts between side and rear perspectives, frequently cutting to slow-motion sequences that highlight the power and grace of her stride.",
