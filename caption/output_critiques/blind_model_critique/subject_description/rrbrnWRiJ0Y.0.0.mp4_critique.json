    "pre_caption": "A light-skinned hand holds a black, vertical Insta360 camera, which is centered in the view. The camera features a large, circular lens at the top and a rectangular screen in the middle. The screen displays a video of a person skiing down a snowy, tree-lined slope, viewed from behind. This skier wears a black helmet, a white jacket with black sections, and black pants, while holding ski poles. In the background of the main scene, another person wearing a white and black ski suit is also visible on the snow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a hand holding an Insta360 camera overlaid at the center of the frame in a close-up shot. On the camera’s screen, a full-body shot of people skiing ahead is displayed.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a clear and structured description of the primary subjects, but it misses the opportunity to explain the dynamic relationship between them, which is central to this type of video. The description of the skier on the screen and the skier in the midground as two separate observations makes the scene sound coincidental rather than intentional. A more effective caption would clarify that the camera is filming the skier who is simultaneously visible in the wider shot, likely achieved with a selfie stick that creates a third-person video game-like perspective. The repetition of the skier's full description (\"wearing a black ski suit and a black-and-white backpack\") is redundant and could be streamlined. Furthermore, describing the skier as being \"in the midground\" is spatially ambiguous; a more precise term like \"directly behind the camera\" would better capture the likely composition. Finally, the description of the action is static; adding a more dynamic verb than \"skiing,\" such as \"carving\" or \"gliding,\" and mentioning the movement of snow kicked up by the skis would add valuable context and bring the scene to life.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A light-skinned hand holds a black, vertical Insta360 camera, centered in the view, capturing a dynamic scene. The camera, equipped with a large circular lens at the top and a rectangular screen in the middle, displays a video of a skier carving down a snowy, tree-lined slope. This skier, wearing a black helmet, a white jacket with black sections, and black pants, is directly behind the camera, creating a third-person video game-like perspective likely achieved with a selfie stick. Snow sprays up from the skier's movements, adding energy to the scene. In the background, another person in a white and black ski suit is visible on the snow, enhancing the sense of a shared adventure.",
