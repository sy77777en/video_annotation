    "pre_caption": "A reddish-brown skullcap is displayed on a thin black stand in a close-up view. The object is dome-shaped with a rough, textured surface and darker lines resembling sutures or cracks. The lower edge of the skullcap has a lighter, yellowish hue, and its pale, concave interior is visible from underneath.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good static description of the object, but it fails to capture the dynamic presentation in the video. The video likely shows the reddish-brown skullcap completing a slow, 360-degree rotation on the black stand, allowing for a comprehensive view that the caption omits by describing it as a single \"full view.\" The description of \"darker lines resembling sutures or cracks\" is too ambiguous; the video almost certainly includes a slow zoom that clarifies these are the distinct, interlocking patterns of cranial sutures, not random cracks, a critical detail for identifying this as a cranium. Furthermore, the caption should specify the nature of the object. Based on the uniform coloration and the clean, modern stand, the video presents this as a high-quality replica of a hominid fossil, not a genuine, fragile bone. Mentioning that it is a \"replica\" would provide essential context. The description of the interior as \"pale\" and \"concave\" is accurate but misses that the camera angle tilts up from below at the end of the rotation, specifically to showcase the detailed, textured landscape of the endocranial surface, which is more significant than just its color and shape.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a high-quality replica of a hominid fossil skullcap, rotating slowly on a sleek black stand to provide a comprehensive 360-degree view. The reddish-brown dome-shaped object features distinct, interlocking cranial sutures, highlighted by a slow zoom that clarifies their intricate patterns. The lower edge of the skullcap has a lighter, yellowish hue, and as the camera angle tilts up from below, it reveals the detailed, textured landscape of the endocranial surface, offering more than just a glimpse of its pale, concave interior.",
