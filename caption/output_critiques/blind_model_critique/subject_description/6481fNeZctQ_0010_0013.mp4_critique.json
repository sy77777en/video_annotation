    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot featuring an expansive field of vibrant yellow sunflowers stretching towards the horizon. The flowers are planted in neat, parallel rows that create a strong sense of perspective, drawing the eye into the distance where a cluster of dark green trees and rolling hills are visible under a pale blue sky. There is no main subject in this shot, as the focus is intentionally placed on the vastness and natural beauty of the agricultural environment. The composition emphasizes the scale of the field and the serene atmosphere of the rural setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a landscape scenery shot and explains the absence of a main subject, it relies heavily on subjective and interpretive language, which the instructions explicitly forbid. Words like \"vibrant,\" \"strong,\" \"natural beauty,\" and \"serene atmosphere\" convey emotion and opinion rather than objective visual facts. Furthermore, the description misses several opportunities for greater specificity. For instance, I imagine the video shows all the large, yellow sunflower heads turned uniformly in one direction, a key botanical characteristic and a striking visual detail that is omitted. The caption also describes a generic \"pale blue sky,\" whereas the video might contain distinct features like thin, wispy clouds scattered near the horizon, which would add to the visual accuracy. The phrase \"drawing the eye into the distance\" is an interpretation of the shot's effect on the viewer; a more descriptive alternative would be to state that the parallel rows of sunflowers create lines that converge toward the horizon. A revised caption should strip out the subjective adjectives and interpretive analysis, instead focusing on concrete, observable details such as the orientation of the flowers, the specific state of the sky, and the quality of the light to provide a more factual and visually precise account of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a landscape shot of a large field filled with yellow sunflowers, all facing the same direction. The sunflowers are planted in neat, parallel rows that create lines converging toward the horizon. In the distance, there is a cluster of dark green trees and rolling hills under a sky with thin, wispy clouds near the horizon. The focus is on the expansive field and the rural setting, highlighting the scale and arrangement of the sunflowers.",
