    "pre_caption": "The video is captured from a high-angle, rear-facing perspective, seemingly from a camera mounted on the helmet of a person playing ice hockey. This person has long, dark hair extending from beneath a white hockey helmet and is wearing a plain red long-sleeved jersey over dark blue hockey pants with a red and white side stripe. They are also wearing black ice skates. In the upper left of the scene, another hockey player appears, dressed in a yellow and dark blue jersey and dark pants.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The camera appears to be mounted on top of the helmet of this person in red. It tail tracks her, capturing her playing ice hockey in a full-body shot. As the shot moves, another ice hockey player in yellow enters the frame from the upper left.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the first-person perspective and the basic appearance of the two players, but it fails to capture the dynamic action inherent in a hockey video. It describes the scene statically, omitting crucial actions such as the main player skating quickly across the ice, their arms and stick moving as they handle a black puck, which is likely visible at the bottom of the view. The description of the second player simply \"appearing\" is too passive; the video probably shows this player in the yellow jersey actively skating to intercept or defend against the main player, creating a sense of opposition. Furthermore, the caption completely misses mentioning the hockey stick held by the main player, a key object that is almost certainly in view and central to the action. A more effective description would integrate these actions, describing the main player stick-handling a puck while being pursued or challenged by the opponent, which would better reflect the content of a sports clip.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a dynamic, first-person perspective from a camera mounted on the helmet of a person playing ice hockey. This player, with long, dark hair flowing from beneath a white hockey helmet, is wearing a plain red long-sleeved jersey over dark blue hockey pants with a red and white side stripe, and black ice skates. They are swiftly skating across the ice, skillfully handling a black puck with their hockey stick, which is prominently visible in the frame. In the upper left, another player in a yellow and dark blue jersey and dark pants is actively skating, attempting to intercept or defend against the main player, adding a sense of competition and urgency to the scene.",
