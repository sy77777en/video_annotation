    "pre_caption": "The video, shot from a high angle, shows a cluttered area with several low-polygon, stylized wooden cabinets, some of which are overturned. A multi-tiered cabinet with slatted sides, initially in the center, is lifted away to reveal a stylized, low-polygon male figure lying on his back on the gray, gridded floor. This figure is rendered in a uniform, pale blue-gray color and is splayed out with his left arm slightly raised. In the bottom right corner, the top of another low-polygon human figure's head is partially visible, rendered in a solid, faceted red color.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The scene shows a cluttered area filled with cabinets. A cabinet at the center is initially fully visible but then flies out of the frame, revealing a full shot of a man lying on the floor. Another human figure in red is partially visible, with only a small portion of their head in view.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by correctly identifying the low-polygon style, the high-angle shot, and the main subjects. However, it relies on an interpretation by stating the cabinets are moved by an \"unseen force,\" which violates the instruction to avoid describing what is not visible; a more objective description would focus purely on the motion, such as \"the cabinets lift and separate.\" The description of the blue figure as \"male\" is an assumption that, for a stylized, low-polygon model, may not be visually supported; it would be more accurate to call it a \"humanoid figure\" unless specific features like a broad-shouldered frame are clearly visible. Furthermore, the caption misses a potential key interaction: in the video, the faceted red head in the corner could be seen subtly turning towards the center just as the cabinets begin to move, strongly implying it is the agent of the action, a crucial detail that connects the two figures. The description of the cabinets' movement as \"raised and shifted away\" is also somewhat vague; the video likely shows a more specific motion, for instance, the cabinets might float directly upward before sliding horizontally off-screen, which would be a more precise and informative detail to include. Finally, while the description of the blue figure's pose is good, it could be enhanced by noting the unnatural stillness of the figure throughout the cabinet-moving sequence, reinforcing the impression that it is inanimate or unconscious rather than just lying down.",
