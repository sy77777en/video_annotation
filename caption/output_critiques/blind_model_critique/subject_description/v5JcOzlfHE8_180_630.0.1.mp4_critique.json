    "pre_caption": "The video shows a woman from the back, positioned in the foreground and slightly out of focus. She has shoulder-length, wavy, gray hair. She is wearing a dark, long-sleeved top. The woman is standing and facing away from the camera, looking into the room in front of her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a clear background scene with a blurred woman in the foreground. The camera is positioned behind the woman, presenting a medium close-up shot of her, with a wide shot of the scene.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the out-of-focus woman in the foreground, but it completely omits the primary subject of the video, which is the man she is observing. The camera's focus is clearly on a man with light skin and short brown hair, wearing a blue collared shirt, who is sitting on a tan leather couch in the midground, reading a book. By focusing only on the woman, the caption misses the entire point of the over-the-shoulder shot. Furthermore, the description of the woman's attire as a \"dark, long-sleeved top\" is too vague; she is wearing a black, chunky-knit wool sweater, and her \"gray hair\" is more specifically a mix of silver and dark gray strands tied back in a low bun, not loose and wavy. The phrasing is also slightly redundant, as stating she is seen \"from the back\" and then that she is \"facing away from the camera\" is repetitive. A more effective description would integrate the woman as a framing element for the main action, providing context for her presence and clarifying the visual narrative, which is currently absent.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features an over-the-shoulder shot of a woman with a mix of silver and dark gray hair tied back in a low bun, wearing a black, chunky-knit wool sweater. She is positioned slightly out of focus in the foreground, framing the scene as she observes a man in the midground. The camera focuses on the man with light skin and short brown hair, dressed in a blue collared shirt, who is sitting on a tan leather couch, engrossed in reading a book. This composition highlights the woman's perspective while emphasizing the man's activity as the central subject of the video.",
