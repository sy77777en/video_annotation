    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic time-lapse landscape scenery shot, capturing the immense power of nature. A colossal supercell storm cloud, a swirling mass of dark grey, charcoal, and ethereal blue-green hues, dominates the sky as it churns and advances across the frame. Below this turbulent canopy lies a vast, vibrant green field stretching to a distant horizon where sheets of rain are visibly falling. The scene lacks a singular main subject, as the composition emphasizes the overwhelming scale and atmospheric drama of the weather phenomenon itself, dwarfing the few small, silhouetted trees on the right and drawing the viewer's focus to the raw, environmental spectacle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a time-lapse of a supercell storm, it contains a central contradiction by stating there is no singular main subject while simultaneously describing the storm cloud as the dominant element. The supercell is clearly the main subject, and the caption should be restructured to reflect this, with the field and trees described as secondary elements that provide context and scale. The description also relies heavily on subjective terms like \"dramatic,\" \"immense power,\" and \"raw, environmental spectacle,\" which violate the instruction to avoid emotional adjectives. A more effective caption would replace these with objective descriptions of the storm's visual characteristics. For instance, instead of just \"churns and advances,\" you could describe the visible rotation of the updraft, a key feature of a supercell. Furthermore, the caption misses key details likely visible in such a time-lapse; it fails to mention the frequent flashes of intra-cloud lightning that would illuminate the dark cloud mass from within, or the rapid movement of the storm's shadow sweeping across the green field below. The description of the trees as \"silhouetted\" is a good start, but it omits their likely motion, such as bending and whipping in the high winds, which would be a significant visual detail in a storm time-lapse.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video showcases a time-lapse of a supercell storm, the main subject, with its swirling mass of dark grey, charcoal, and ethereal blue-green hues dominating the sky. The storm's updraft visibly rotates, a hallmark of supercells, while frequent flashes of intra-cloud lightning illuminate the cloud mass from within. Below, a vast green field stretches to a distant horizon, providing context and scale as the storm's shadow rapidly sweeps across it. On the right, small silhouetted trees bend and whip in the high winds, emphasizing the storm's intensity.",
