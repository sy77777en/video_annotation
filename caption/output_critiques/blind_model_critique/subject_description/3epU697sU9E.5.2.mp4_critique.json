    "pre_caption": "The main subject is a detailed model of an airplane, identifiable as Air Force One, a Boeing 747. The aircraft is primarily white with a light blue stripe running horizontally along its fuselage and a blue tail fin displaying the American flag and a seal. It is shown from a top-down, slightly angled perspective, revealing its four engines and the characteristic hump on the upper deck. Scattered around this central, sharply focused plane are several smaller, all-white airplanes. These secondary planes are less detailed, appear out of focus, and are positioned at various distances and orientations against the black background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject as a model of Air Force One and accurately describes its color scheme and key features like the four engines and upper deck hump, it misses several key visual details that are prominent in the video. The description of the camera movement as \"cranes down\" is accurate, but it fails to capture the fluid, continuous nature of the shot, which smoothly transitions from the high-angle view to the profile without a cut. Furthermore, as the camera reaches the profile view, it lingers on the side of the fuselage, bringing the large, blue \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" text into sharp focus, a detail the caption omits entirely. The caption also neglects to mention the model's landing gear, which is fully extended and highly detailed, visible throughout the profile shot. The description of the Presidential Seal is too generic; the video clearly shows the intricate details of the eagle and shield within the seal. Finally, while the secondary planes are correctly identified as out of focus, the caption could be more specific by noting that these stylized, generic jet forms are not static but are drifting slowly and subtly across the black background, creating a dynamic sense of depth rather than just a static arrangement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a detailed model of Air Force One, a Boeing 747, with a primarily white body and a light blue stripe along its fuselage. The blue tail fin prominently displays the American flag and a highly detailed Presidential Seal, featuring an intricately depicted eagle and shield. The camera smoothly cranes down from a top-down, slightly angled perspective to a profile view, highlighting the four engines, the characteristic hump on the upper deck, and the fully extended, highly detailed landing gear. As the camera lingers on the side of the fuselage, the large, blue \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" text comes into sharp focus. Surrounding the central plane are several smaller, stylized, all-white airplanes, which are out of focus and drift subtly across the black background, adding a dynamic sense of depth to the scene.",
