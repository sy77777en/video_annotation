    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a vast, desolate, and snow-covered mountain range under a gray, overcast sky. A heavy fog or mist blankets the scene, obscuring the distance, while soft snowflakes drift down through the air. The focus of the shot is on the immense scale and cold, solitary atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific subject. This is emphasized by a single, small, stylized figure sitting atop a snowy peak, emitting a warm, golden glow that contrasts with the cold, muted tones of the surrounding landscape and illuminates a faint path leading up the slope.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I have imagined.\n\nWhile the caption effectively captures the cold, solitary atmosphere and provides good specific details about the house, it fundamentally misinterprets the video's focus. The primary issue is the contradictory statement that this is a scenery shot without a specific subject, immediately followed by a detailed description of a small, warmly lit house that is clearly the visual and narrative anchor of the entire scene. The contrast between the warm, golden light of the house and the cold, gray landscape makes it the undeniable focal point. The description should be restructured to present the house as the main subject set within a vast environment, rather than an incidental detail. Furthermore, the description of the \"faint path\" being illuminated by the house light seems unlikely; in the video, the path is simply a set of faint indentations in the snow leading toward the dwelling, not actively lit by it. The caption also misses a key dynamic element: the video is not static but features a very slow, almost imperceptible zoom-in on the house, which further reinforces it as the subject. Finally, a thin wisp of smoke is seen curling from the dark red chimney, a crucial detail that adds a sense of life and warmth to the desolate setting, which the current description omits.",
