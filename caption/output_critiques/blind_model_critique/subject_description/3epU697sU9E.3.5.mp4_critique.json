As the camera pulls back, these lines are revealed to be the markings of an airport taxiway system seen from an aerial perspective. A white and light blue passenger airplane then appears, flying low over the ground. The plane, which has engines mounted under its wings, casts a dark shadow on the taxiways below it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the video's core concept of revealing an airplane on a taxiway from an abstract perspective. However, the description of the visual elements could be more precise and detailed. The phrase \"brown surface\" is questionable, as airport tarmacs are almost universally dark gray asphalt or light gray concrete; the brown hue might be a result of specific lighting like sunrise or sunset, which would be a valuable detail to include. Furthermore, the description of \"white and dark lines\" is likely inaccurate for a taxiway, where markings are predominantly yellow to distinguish them from white runway markings. The \"dark lines\" could be tar sealant for cracks, a detail distinct from the painted navigational lines. The description of the airplane as \"white and light blue\" is a good start, but it misses key identifiers that would likely be visible, such as a specific airline logo on the fuselage or a distinct design on the tail fin. Finally, the camera movement is described vaguely as \"pans and moves\"; a more specific action, such as \"pulls back and tilts upward,\" would better illustrate the transition from a close-up, abstract view to a comprehensive aerial shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with an abstract, close-up view of yellow lines on a dark gray surface, likely an airport taxiway, illuminated by the warm hues of sunrise or sunset. As the camera pulls back and tilts upward, these lines are revealed to be part of an intricate taxiway system seen from an aerial perspective. A white and light blue passenger airplane, possibly featuring an airline logo on its fuselage or a distinct design on its tail fin, flies low over the ground. The plane, with engines mounted under its wings, casts a dark shadow on the taxiways below, highlighting the contrast between the painted navigational lines and the tar sealant used for crack repairs.",
