    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a clear view of an older, fair-skinned man with voluminous, styled white hair standing at a long, candle-lit dinner table. He is dressed in a dark blue, high-collared jacket with gold embroidery and red cuffs, worn over a white shirt and white trousers, and he holds a glass up as if making a toast. The camera's focus then shifts, blurring the man and the background, and settles on a fair-skinned woman in the foreground, viewed in profile from the right. She has light brown, curly hair styled in an updo and wears large, ornate, dangling gold earrings. She is seated and looks towards the man's direction. Next to her, another woman with dark hair adorned with yellow flowers is partially visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the sequence of events and the main subjects, but it could be enhanced with more specific visual and emotional details that seem present in the video. The description of the man's clothing as a \"jacket under a jacket\" is slightly confusing; in the video, it appears to be a single, layered formal coat, perhaps a black greatcoat with an integrated blue, high-collared vest-like front and red lapels, which could be described more clearly as one garment. While his toast is mentioned, the caption omits his facial expression; he seems to have a stern, commanding look as his mouth is slightly open, suggesting he is in the middle of a speech, not just posing. The description of the focus shift to the woman is accurate, but it misses the narrative purpose. The caption should include a description of her attire, as she appears to be wearing a dark, possibly velvet, gown that complements the formal setting. More importantly, her reaction is the key to the scene; as she turns her head, her neutral expression seems to subtly shift to one of quiet concern or disagreement, a crucial detail that the focus shift emphasizes but the caption overlooks. Lastly, the mention of the other guests is good, but the phrasing could be more fluid; instead of detailing the number of people between the subjects, it could simply state that other blurred guests, including the woman with flowers in her hair, are visible at the long table, reinforcing the crowded dinner setting.",
