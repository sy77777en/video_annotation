    "pre_caption": "In a stylized, dimly lit setting, three statue-like figures of men are depicted. Two figures stand close together in the center, both rendered in a reddish-brown, textured material and wearing uniforms composed of a jacket, trousers, boots, and a cap. The figure on the right is turned slightly to his left, raising his left arm to point upwards. The figure beside him faces him, with his arms held at his sides. A third, identical figure is positioned on the far left, standing with his back partially to the viewer and facing towards the left side of the scene. All three figures have a blocky, stylized form.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the three main subjects and their general poses, it lacks precision and misses key visual dynamics that define the video's style. The description of the figures having both a \"textured material\" and a \"wireframed form\" is confusing; the video actually shows solid, orange-hued figures with a texture resembling cracked clay, upon which a separate, glowing white wireframe is superimposed, and this distinction is crucial. The caption is also ambiguous about the pointing gesture, stating it is \"upwards\" while another figure looks \"towards the left\"; the video clearly shows the figure pointing diagonally up and to the left, unifying the focus of the two central figures. Furthermore, the description treats the scene as static, failing to mention the very slow camera push-in that gradually tightens the focus on the two central figures, adding a subtle but important sense of revelation. Finally, the \"dimly lit setting\" could be more specific, as the video uses a single, harsh spotlight from the top-left that casts long, dramatic shadows, accentuating the figures' texture and form, an essential detail for conveying the scene's atmosphere.",
