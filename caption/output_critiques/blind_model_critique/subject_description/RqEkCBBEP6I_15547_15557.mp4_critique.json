    "pre_caption": "A man with shoulder-length, dark brown hair is seen from behind, walking along a set of train tracks in a dark, graffiti-covered tunnel. He wears a brown, textured jacket and has a brown leather satchel slung over his shoulder. Throughout the video, he holds a flashlight in his right hand, casting a bright, circular beam of light ahead of him. At times, he also holds a black pistol in the same hand. At the beginning of the video, a dark, blurry, human-shaped silhouette stands further down the tracks before disappearing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This is a 3D game video. The camera follows the character’s movement from behind. The shot size of the character shifts between a medium shot and a close-up shot, leaving more space for a wide shot of the scene ahead.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subject and the general setting, it lacks crucial details that would convey the video's tone and specific actions. The description of the man \"holding a black pistol\" is ambiguous; it should specify the manner in which he holds it—for instance, if it's held down at his side in a state of readiness or pointed forward, which would significantly alter the scene's perceived tension. The caption states the man is \"walking,\" but a more descriptive verb like \"cautiously advancing\" or \"striding purposefully\" would better capture his movement and intent. Furthermore, the explanation that the silhouettes \"appear and disappear as the camera perspective changes\" is too technical; it would be more visually descriptive to state that they are intermittently obscured by the tunnel's structural pillars as the man moves past them. The caption also misses an opportunity to describe the dynamic effect of the flashlight beam, which likely sweeps across the graffiti-covered walls and glints off the steel tracks, creating a primary visual focus that guides the viewer's eye through the darkness. Finally, describing the silhouettes as \"blurry\" might be a misinterpretation; they could simply be unlit and far away, making \"indistinct\" or \"unilluminated\" a more precise choice.",
