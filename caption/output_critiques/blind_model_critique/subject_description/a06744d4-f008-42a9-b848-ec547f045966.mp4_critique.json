    "pre_caption": "A young man with a light skin tone is shown from a low-angle, fisheye perspective. He wears a dark-colored t-shirt with white lettering, loose-fitting green pants, and a light-colored bucket hat. On his feet are white sneakers with dark, patterned soles. He is in a crouching position, looking down toward the camera while wearing sunglasses and holding his hands out with his fingers slightly curled.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by identifying the subject, his attire, and the distinct camera angle. However, it could be enhanced with more specific visual details that are likely present. For instance, the \"dark-colored t-shirt with white lettering\" might display a specific word, phrase, or graphic logo that is a key part of the subject's aesthetic but is currently unmentioned. The description of his pose, \"holding his hands out with his fingers slightly curled,\" is somewhat ambiguous; clarifying the position of his hands relative to his body (e.g., spread wide on either side of his knees) and the orientation of his palms would create a much clearer mental image of his stance. Furthermore, while the fisheye perspective is correctly identified, the caption misses the opportunity to describe its distorting effect on the subject, such as his hands and white sneakers appearing disproportionately large due to their proximity to the lens. Finally, even with sunglasses on, his mouth and lower face are likely visible, and describing his expression—whether it's neutral, a smirk, or something else—would add a significant layer of detail to the character's portrayal.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A young man with a light skin tone is shown from a low-angle, fisheye perspective, which exaggerates the size of his hands and white sneakers due to their proximity to the lens. He wears a dark-colored t-shirt with white lettering that reads \"Vibe\" and features a small graphic logo. His loose-fitting green pants complement his light-colored bucket hat. In a crouching position, he looks down toward the camera, wearing sunglasses that partially obscure his face, but his mouth is visible, showing a slight smirk. His hands are spread wide on either side of his knees, with fingers slightly curled and palms facing inward, adding a dynamic element to his pose.",
