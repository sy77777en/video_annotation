    "pre_caption": "The video features two white, featureless humanoid figures in the foreground, positioned as if they are watching a bank of television monitors. The figure on the left is seen from the back of the head and shoulders, while the one on the right is a partial upper body, posed with a hand to its chin. The monitors in the background all display scenes from the game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\". The central screen, which is the main focus, shows a medium close-up of a fair-skinned male contestant with short brown hair and a receding hairline. He wears a light blue polo shirt with a white collar and striped shoulders and is seen smiling thoughtfully with his hand on his chin. Other screens show different angles of the same contestant, as well as an older, fair-skinned male host with light-colored hair, dressed in a suit and tie. As the camera moves closer to the screens, the foreground figures gradually move out of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with two humanoid subjects, one showing only the head on the left and the other a partly visible upper body on the right, against a background of multiple broadcast screens. As the camera moves forward, the subjects gradually move out of frame, ending on a full shot of one screen with parts of others still visible, showing a person in a medium close-up.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively identifies the main subjects and the overall action, it could be improved by adding more specific visual texture and clarifying some ambiguities. The description of the \"white, featureless humanoid figures\" could be enhanced by specifying their material and finish, such as whether they are glossy plastic or matte plaster, and their posture, for instance, if they are standing rigidly or sitting in chairs. The object held by the figure on the right, described as \"resembling a telephone,\" could be more precisely identified; for example, it might be a distinctively vintage, black rotary phone receiver, which would create a notable contrast. The \"bank of television monitors\" lacks detail on their type and arrangement—specifying if they are old, bulky CRT screens or modern flat panels, and if they are arranged in a neat grid or a chaotic cluster, would strengthen the visual. The contestant's expression, \"smiling thoughtfully,\" is subjective; a more objective description like \"a slight, closed-mouth smile with his gaze directed downward\" would be better. Finally, the caption omits the overall lighting of the scene; mentioning that the figures and monitors are in a dark room, illuminated solely by the light from the screens, would be a crucial detail for establishing the atmosphere of surveillance and voyeurism.",
