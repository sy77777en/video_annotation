    "pre_caption": "A large, ape-like Titan stands as the central figure, leading a group of other Titans emerging from a thick mist over a grassy field. This main subject is a massive, muscular humanoid covered in dark brown fur, with a bare, well-defined chest and abdomen. It has long, powerful arms, a slightly hunched posture, and a humanoid face with a beard and glowing red eyes. Surrounding it are numerous other Titans of varying sizes and builds. These secondary figures are all naked, with disproportionate bodies; some are tall and thin, while others are short and stout. One notable Titan on the left is on all fours, carrying a large wooden crate on its back. All of these Titans, like their leader, have glowing red eyes and appear to be advancing together as a unified force.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a strong overview of the scene, but it overlooks several key visual details and misidentifies one element. While it correctly describes the main ape-like Titan's fur and muscular build, it fails to mention the prominent, wispy steam that is continuously venting from its shoulders and back, indicating immense body heat. The description of the object on the four-legged Titan's back as a \"large crate\" is inaccurate; the video clearly shows it is a complex, dark gray metallic rig with multiple barrels and ammunition packs, suggesting a weapon system rather than cargo. Furthermore, the caption states the Titans are \"standing still,\" which is not entirely true. The video shows subtle, unsettling movements: a tall, emaciated Titan in the mid-ground is slowly and rhythmically swaying from side to side, and the main Titan's head makes a slow, deliberate turn to scan the field, its glowing red eyes leaving faint light trails in the dense mist. Finally, the description of the secondary Titans as simply \"naked\" is incomplete, as many of them have visible, old scars and discolored patches of skin that add to their menacing appearance.",
