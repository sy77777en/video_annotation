    "pre_caption": "A light turquoise, retro-style record player is shown from a top-down perspective. On its spinning turntable rests a black vinyl record with an orange and red center label that has the word \"POLLYANNA\" printed on it. Several bottle caps of various colors and sizes, including silver, white, orange, and gold, are placed on the record, spinning along with it. A light-skinned hand, which appears to belong to an older person, enters the frame from the bottom right, reaches toward the turntable, and stops the record from spinning before retracting out of view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Initially, it's a full shot of a retro record player.  Then, a hand enters the frame from the bottom and exits the frame after stopping the player.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and the core action, but it could be more objective and visually detailed. The phrase \"appears to belong to an older person\" is an inference; the caption should instead describe the visible characteristics that suggest age, such as \"the hand has wrinkled skin and prominent veins.\" The description of the bottle caps as \"several\" is vague; if their quantity is clear (e.g., \"five bottle caps\"), that would be more precise, as would noting their arrangement or if they are face-up or face-down. The action of stopping the record could be more specific—for instance, \"the hand gently places a finger on the outer rim of the record to slow it to a halt\" provides a clearer picture than just \"stops the record.\" Additionally, a key detail is likely missing: the state of the tonearm. Mentioning that \"the tonearm is in its resting cradle\" would add important context, clarifying that the turntable is spinning without the record actually being played. Finally, the description of the hand's movement could be more nuanced, specifying the pace at which it stops the record and retracts to better capture the deliberate nature of the action.",

Five bottle caps of various colors and sizes, including silver, white, orange, and gold, are placed face-up on the record, spinning along with it. The tonearm is in its resting cradle, indicating the record is not being played. A light-skinned hand with wrinkled skin and prominent veins, suggesting age, enters the frame from the bottom right. The hand gently places a finger on the outer rim of the record, gradually slowing it to a halt, before retracting slowly and deliberately out of view.",
