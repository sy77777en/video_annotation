    "pre_caption": "Multiple identical young men with fair skin and very short, buzzed hair are arranged on the landings of a multi-level, square staircase. Each man is dressed in a dark, muted-tone jacket over a lighter shirt. They all lean over the dark railings, looking down, which creates a repeating, nested visual pattern that recedes into the distance above.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the general subject matter of young people in gray coats on a staircase, it contains several inaccuracies and omissions based on the video's content. The description of the group as \"diverse\" is immediately contradicted by the limiting phrase \"with fair skin\"; the video actually features a multi-ethnic cast with a range of skin tones from fair to light brown and dark brown. The final sentence, \"creating a striking visual pattern that draws the viewer's eye upward,\" is a subjective interpretation of the composition and should be removed in favor of a more objective description. Furthermore, the caption oversimplifies the attire; while the coats are all shades of gray, they are distinct styles, including single-breasted overcoats and double-breasted trench coats, and not every person wears a black waist belt—some have matching gray fabric belts, and a few have no belt at all. The description also completely omits their footwear, which consists of uniform, heavy black combat boots on every person. Lastly, the statement that \"they all look directly at the camera\" is not entirely accurate, as the video shows a few individuals on the lower steps looking up at those above them, and one woman on the right briefly glances away before returning her gaze forward, adding a subtle dynamic element the static description misses.",
