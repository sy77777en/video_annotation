    "pre_caption": "A man with a lean, athletic build is depicted wearing a form-fitting, dark red or maroon full-body suit. The suit features a cowl that covers the top of his head and has small, wing-like protrusions on the sides. The figure appears translucent and ethereal, as if made of energy, with wisps of blue, white, and yellow light swirling around and through his body, causing his form to shimmer and distort. He stands with his arms slightly extended to his sides.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the subject's general appearance and the ethereal energy effect, it lacks dynamism and specificity that would be present in a video. The description of the figure as simply standing with arms extended misses the subtle but constant motion; the blue and white energy isn't just swirling but actively crackling and pulsing, causing the figure to flicker in and out of solidity, and the background brick wall is clearly visible through his torso during these flickers. The caption's use of \"wing-like protrusions\" is imprecise; the video clearly shows these are small, distinct horns on the cowl, characteristic of a specific vigilante archetype. Furthermore, the description omits key details visible in the video: the lower half of the man's face, showing a grimly set jaw with light stubble, is uncovered by the cowl, and there is a faint, stylized double 'D' emblem on his chest that becomes more apparent when the white light pulses brightest. Finally, the caption fails to mention how the swirling light interacts with the environment, as the video shows the blue energy casting a faint, pulsating glow on the wet pavement at his feet, grounding the otherwise ethereal figure in the scene.",
