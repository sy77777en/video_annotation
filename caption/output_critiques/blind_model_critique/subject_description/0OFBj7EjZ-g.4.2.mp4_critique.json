    "pre_caption": "A large, dark, industrial-style structure, composed of gray and brown panels, is shown against a black background. The top of the rectangular building features details like circular vents and ductwork. The structure begins to deconstruct, with its walls and components breaking apart into numerous smaller, irregular fragments that fly outwards. This process reveals the interior, which contains a vast, orderly grid of small, square, light-brown objects resembling wooden pallets, all arranged neatly on a dark floor marked with a light-blue grid. The building continues to disassemble until only the grid of pallets and scattered fragments remain visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows the part of a structure resembling a factory building. Initially, it appears intact, but soon, it gradually breaks apart into fragments, revealing some block-like pieces inside.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the core action of a structure deconstructing to reveal an interior, it lacks the specific visual detail and dynamic language that would fully represent the video's content. The description of the building as being made of \"gray and brown panels\" is too generic; the video clearly shows a mix of textures, including weathered corrugated steel, smooth concrete sections, and metallic ductwork with visible rivets and even some light rust, which adds to the industrial realism. The deconstruction process is more chaotic and detailed than just fragments \"fly[ing] outwards\"; the pieces actually tumble and rotate as they explode, with smaller components breaking off from larger ones and a fine particulate dust clouding the initial burst. The caption's description of the interior pallets is also incomplete. It correctly notes their grid-like arrangement but fails to mention that they are not empty; each pallet is stacked three-high with smaller, identical cardboard boxes held together by clear plastic shrink-wrap, a crucial detail that defines the space as a storage facility. Lastly, the final sentence is confusing and doesn't accurately portray the end state; it would be clearer to state that after the walls and roof dissipate, only the foundational floor grid and the skeletal steel support beams remain, suspended in the void with the debris floating motionlessly around them.",
