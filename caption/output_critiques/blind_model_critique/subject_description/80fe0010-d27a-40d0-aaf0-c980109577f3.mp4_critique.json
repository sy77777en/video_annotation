    "pre_caption": "The main subject of the video is a man with short, dark hair, viewed mostly from behind as he walks down a narrow alley. He is wearing a brown short-sleeved polo shirt, light grey trousers, and a dark watch on his left wrist. As he proceeds, two translucent, ghostly figures of a woman momentarily appear and fade. The first figure is a woman in a patterned, short-sleeved dress, seen riding a bicycle. The second figure is a woman in a light-colored, sleeveless dress with her hair styled up, who appears standing on the left side of the alley, looking down at something she is holding. The man briefly turns his head to the side during his walk.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject and the general sequence of events, but it misses several key visual details that are central to the video's narrative. The description of the two female figures is confusing; stating that two figures \"momentarily appear\" before clarifying that the second one \"does not disappear\" is contradictory. It would be clearer to state that the first figure is fleeting while the second one persists. The caption also omits a crucial detail about the second woman: the object she is holding is a small, antique silver locket, which she gazes at intently. Furthermore, the description of the man's reaction is understated; he doesn't just turn his head, he visibly slows his walk and his posture stiffens upon seeing the second woman, indicating a reaction of shock or recognition rather than simple observation. Finally, the \"translucent, ghostly\" effect could be more specific, as the figures in the video have a distinct, shimmering blue aura and their forms waver, and the \"patterned\" dress on the bicyclist is a clear black-and-white floral print, details that would significantly improve the accuracy of the description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a man with short, dark hair, primarily seen from behind as he walks down a narrow alley. He is dressed in a brown short-sleeved polo shirt, light grey trousers, and wears a dark watch on his left wrist. As he walks, two shimmering, blue-aura figures appear. The first is a fleeting image of a woman in a black-and-white floral print dress, riding a bicycle. The second figure, more persistent, is a woman in a light-colored, sleeveless dress with her hair styled up, standing on the left side of the alley. She gazes intently at a small, antique silver locket in her hands. Upon seeing this second woman, the man visibly slows his walk and his posture stiffens, suggesting a reaction of shock or recognition.",
