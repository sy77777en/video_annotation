    "pre_caption": "The central subject is a massive ship under construction within a dry dock. The ship's hull is painted red on the bottom half and black on the top half. Its bow is pointed and unfinished, and the entire structure is enveloped in extensive metal scaffolding. In the lower-right foreground, the back of a person is visible. This individual wears a yellow hard hat and an orange safety vest over a dark shirt. In the midground on the left, a group of three people stands together, all wearing yellow hard hats and orange safety vests over dark clothing. They are observing the ship. In the distance, near the base of the ship, two more smaller figures, also appearing to be workers, can be seen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a full shot of a large ship along with several humanoid subjects. A humanoid in the lower-right foreground is partially visible, while three humanoids in the midground on the left are fully visible.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the primary subject and the general context, but it misses the dynamic activity central to the video. For instance, the group of three people are not just standing; they are actively engaged, with one individual pointing towards the ship's superstructure while another reviews a large blueprint. The description of the ship's bow as \"unfinished\" is too general; the video clearly shows sparks flying from the scaffolding as welders work on the exposed steel framework. A key element omitted is a massive yellow gantry crane that is slowly lowering a large prefabricated section onto the ship's deck, a dominant action in the scene. Furthermore, the person in the foreground is not merely present but is actively coordinating the work, speaking into a walkie-talkie while facing the ship. The caption also fails to specify the ship's type, which, based on its blocky superstructure and overall shape, is clearly a container ship, and it neglects to mention the prominent bulbous bow, a key feature of the hull's design even in its incomplete state.",
