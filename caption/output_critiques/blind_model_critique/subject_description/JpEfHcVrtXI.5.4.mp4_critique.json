    "pre_caption": "A small, white, glowing creature with a quadrupedal form, long pointed ears, and a slender tail is present in a dark environment. This creature emits a soft white light from its body. Also visible are large, dark, log-like structures covered entirely in sharp, crystalline spikes, which are suspended horizontally in the air. In the scene, there are clusters of small, glowing blue mushrooms attached to rock surfaces and a small, floating orb of blue light.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the key fantastical subjects, but it describes them as a static collection of items rather than as components of a dynamic scene. By stating the creature \"is present,\" the description misses that the creature is actively in motion, cautiously walking and navigating the environment. The caption also fails to describe the relationships between the subjects; for example, the floating orb of blue light isn't just in the scene, it appears to be a wisp or guide, hovering near the creature and leading it forward. Furthermore, the \"log-like structures\" are not just suspended randomly but are arranged to form a clear, albeit broken, pathway that the creature is traversing. The description of these structures could also be improved by noting that the crystalline spikes glint and reflect the light from the creature and the orb, which is a prominent visual effect. A more effective caption would describe the creature's journey, integrating the other elements контекстуально—mentioning that it walks *on* the logs, is accompanied *by* the orb, and moves past the glowing mushrooms, which are attached to the distant cavern walls.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dark, mystical environment, a small, white, glowing creature with a quadrupedal form, long pointed ears, and a slender tail cautiously navigates its surroundings. It emits a soft white light as it walks along a pathway formed by large, dark, log-like structures, which are covered in sharp, crystalline spikes that glint and reflect the creature's glow. These structures create a broken path that the creature carefully traverses. Accompanying the creature is a small, floating orb of blue light, acting as a wisp or guide, hovering nearby and leading it forward. As the creature moves, it passes clusters of small, glowing blue mushrooms attached to the distant cavern walls, adding to the enchanting atmosphere of the scene.",
