    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a person is shown spearfishing, with their hands covered in blue and white patterned gloves that have a white, textured honeycomb design on the palms. They are holding a black speargun, which has a black rubber band with a yellow tip and a thin metal spear with a barbed point. One of the person's fins is also visible; it is black with the word \"Younger\" written in white vertical lettering. The scene transitions from an underwater view of a seabed covered in green seaweed to an above-water perspective of the clear, shallow sea and a rocky, sandy shoreline.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately details the spearfisher's gear, such as the patterned gloves and the speargun, it completely omits the primary subject of the action: a medium-sized, silver-sided fish with dark vertical stripes that is seen swimming near a cluster of rocks just before the speargun is aimed. The description of the transition is also too generic; it fails to capture the dynamic action of the person surfacing, where the camera lens breaks the water's surface, creating a split-shot view with water droplets momentarily obscuring the above-water shoreline. Furthermore, the phrasing that the fins are \"held together\" is misleading, as the video shows them on the person's feet, which are simply positioned close to one another while treading water. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the visual quality of the underwater scene, such as the distinct rays of sunlight filtering through the water and illuminating particles floating near the green seaweed. A more effective description would introduce the fish as the target early on, describe the action of surfacing rather than just the resulting change in scenery, and clarify the position of the fins on the person's feet to provide a more accurate and engaging account of the video's content.",
