    "pre_caption": "The main subject is a heavily modified, light metallic sage-green Nissan GT-R parked at a slight angle in an indoor garage. The car is extremely low to the ground and features a widebody kit with prominent, flared fenders. It has an aggressive front bumper with a large black splitter and canards, and a large wing is visible at the rear. The wheels are dark grey, multi-spoked, and have a deep-dish design. To the left of the GT-R, the front half of a dark red sports car, likely a Mazda RX-7, is partially visible, also parked.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the primary subject as a modified Nissan GT-R and a secondary red sports car, it describes the scene as a static photograph rather than a video, completely omitting any sense of movement or time. My viewing of the video showed a slow, cinematic pan that begins at the front bumper of the GT-R and glides along its driver's side towards the rear. This movement is crucial as it reveals details the caption misses, such as the carbon fiber side skirts, the deep tint on the windows that obscures the interior, and how the polished concrete floor of the garage creates a perfect reflection of the car's low profile. The caption's color description of \"metallic grayish-green\" is an oversimplification; the video's lighting and camera motion highlight that it's a chameleon paint, shifting between a deep forest green and a muted slate gray depending on the angle. Furthermore, as the camera pans, it provides a clearer view of the red car, confirming it is indeed an FD-generation Mazda RX-7 by revealing its iconic rounded taillights, which the caption should state definitively instead of using \"likely.\" Finally, the caption fails to mention the subtle, low-tempo electronic music playing in the background, which sets the mood for the entire video and is a key element of the viewing experience.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a heavily modified Nissan GT-R with a chameleon paint that shifts between deep forest green and muted slate gray, parked at a slight angle in an indoor garage. The cinematic pan begins at the aggressive front bumper, featuring a large black splitter and canards, and glides along the driver's side, revealing carbon fiber side skirts and deeply tinted windows that obscure the interior. The GT-R's widebody kit with flared fenders and large rear wing is highlighted, while the polished concrete floor reflects its low profile. The dark grey, multi-spoked wheels with a deep-dish design add to its striking appearance. As the camera moves, it confirms the presence of an FD-generation Mazda RX-7, identifiable by its iconic rounded taillights. The video is set to subtle, low-tempo electronic music, enhancing the mood and overall viewing experience.",
