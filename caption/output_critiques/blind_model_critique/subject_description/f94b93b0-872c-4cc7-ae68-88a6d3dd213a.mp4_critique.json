    "pre_caption": "A person with very long, straight, blonde hair is seen from the back, walking between two other individuals. The central person wears a dark jacket. The two people flanking them, one on the left and one on the right, are mostly visible as dark, out-of-focus silhouettes, with only their shoulders and the side of their heads being discernible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the central action of three individuals walking and the shift in lighting from silhouette to clear view, it lacks specificity and detail. The main subject, described as 'a person,' could likely be more descriptively identified as a 'woman' based on the 'very long, straight, blonde hair.' Furthermore, the description of their attire is minimal; details such as the material of the 'dark jacket' (e.g., leather, cloth) and the color of their pants are missing. The most significant omission is the lack of any descriptive attributes for the two accompanying individuals. Even if only their upper bodies are visible, details like their hair color and style (e.g., one with short dark hair, the other with brown shoulder-length hair) and the specific type and color of their jackets (e.g., a grey hoodie, a blue denim jacket) should be included to properly distinguish them. Finally, the phrasing 'walking ahead of' could be refined to 'leading' or 'walking with' to better convey the sense of a cohesive group rather than three separate people.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman with very long, straight, blonde hair is seen from the back, leading two other individuals as they walk together. She wears a dark leather jacket and black pants. The person on her left has short dark hair and is wearing a grey hoodie, while the person on her right has brown shoulder-length hair and is dressed in a blue denim jacket. The two accompanying individuals are mostly visible as dark, out-of-focus silhouettes, with only their shoulders and the sides of their heads being discernible.",
