    "pre_caption": "A group of people is shown from a high-angle, overhead perspective on a black and white checkered floor. One individual with short, blonde hair is wearing a blue top. Another person, also dressed in a blue outfit, is at the center of the activity. A third person in a red garment is partially visible. The scene is filled with a shower of small, colorful particles resembling confetti. The perspective then inverts, showing the people upside down, as if they are on the ceiling, amidst the continuing fall of particles.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the viewpoint as a \"bird's-eye view at eye level\" is contradictory; the video likely employs a high-angle shot looking down on the subjects, not a direct overhead or eye-level perspective. The description of the people in blue is ambiguous; it's unclear if the \"individual with chin-length, blonde hair\" is the same as the \"person... at the center of the activity.\" Assuming they are two different people, the caption should distinguish them more clearly, for instance, by identifying the central figure as a man in a royal blue suit and the other as a woman in a lighter blue top. The description lacks dynamism and context; it fails to mention that the people are looking up with joyful expressions and outstretched arms as the confetti showers down on them. The \"small, colorful particles\" could be more vividly described as shimmering, metallic confetti that catches the light. Furthermore, while the inversion is noted, the description could be more impactful by stating that the entire scene flips vertically, making the confetti appear to rise past the now upside-down figures, enhancing the surreal, celebratory atmosphere of the moment.",
