    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively distinguishes the two subjects by their clothing color and remains objective, it misses several key visual details that would likely be present. The description focuses entirely on the lower body and the objects on their backs, completely omitting any mention of the figures' upper bodies, heads, or hair. A more complete description would include the color and style of their shirts, the color and length of their hair, and any visible skin tone on their necks or arms. The term \"animated figures\" is adequate, but could be more specific, such as \"humanoid characters\" or \"block-style avatars,\" if the animation style suggests it. Furthermore, the \"simple, vertically oriented rectangular objects\" could be described with more detail regarding their apparent texture or function, for instance, as \"smooth, plastic-like backpacks.\" The phrasing could also be more concise; instead of describing the pants and then the packs in separate clauses, these details could be integrated into the description of each figure for better flow. Finally, stating the right figure's arm is \"partially visible\" is less informative than describing its pose, such as \"with its left arm held slightly akimbo\" or \"bent at the elbow.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Two block-style avatars are seen from behind, walking away from the viewer. The avatar on the left is purple, wearing a smooth, plastic-like backpack, and the one on the right is blue, slightly taller, with its left arm bent at the elbow. Both have simple, vertically oriented rectangular bodies with two short legs, and no distinct heads or hair are visible. The blue avatar's shirt is a lighter shade of blue, while the purple avatar's shirt matches its body color. The figures' upper bodies and any visible skin tone on their necks or arms are not detailed, maintaining a minimalist design.",
