    "pre_caption": "Two women are sitting next to each other, looking toward the right. The woman on the left has light skin, long blonde hair, and is wearing a black tank top. On her head is a white and grey knit beanie with a pom-pom. She wears a black wristband and a colorful patterned wristband on her left wrist. She initially has her hand near her mouth and then brings her hands together. The woman to her right has light skin and long brown hair. She is wearing black sunglasses, a black hooded jacket over a t-shirt with a pink and white graphic, a ring on her right hand, and a pink wristband. She keeps her hand near her mouth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the two women and their basic attire, it contains a factual error and omits several specific visual details that would enhance its accuracy. The description of the first woman's wristbands is repetitive and incorrect; she wears the colorful patterned wristband on her left wrist and the plain black one on her right, not identical sets on both. The caption fails to mention that the second woman's black hooded jacket is unzipped, a key detail that explains why the t-shirt graphic is visible. Furthermore, the description of that graphic as simply \"pink and white\" is too vague; it is a distinct logo for a musical artist. The description of their actions is also imprecise; the first woman doesn't just bring her hands together, she claps them once in reaction to something off-screen, and the second woman isn't just holding her hand near her mouth, she is specifically resting her chin on her knuckles in a thoughtful pose. Lastly, the caption misses their expressions of focused amusement and other smaller details, such as the first woman's hair being in a messy bun under her beanie and the second woman's sunglasses being reflective, mirroring the bright lights of the event they appear to be attending.",
