    "pre_caption": "In a black-and-white, close-up shot, a pair of pale human hands appears over a misty, granular surface. The hands dig into the soil, brushing away the earth to unearth a small, dark object. This object is revealed to be a model boat, caked in dirt and soil, with a distinct hull and a short, thin piece resembling a mast protruding from its deck. The hands continue to clear the surrounding soil before gently lifting the excavated boat.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Initially showing a shallow view of the ground, the camera stays fixed as a pair of human hands are introduced, digging a model boat out of the earth. The shot size changes from a close-up shot of the ground to a close-up shot of human hands and the model boat.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects—the hands and the model boat—and the black-and-white, close-up style, it could be more visually specific and chronologically accurate. The phrase \"The hands take up a small, dark object\" is vague and likely misrepresents the action; the video probably shows the hands first brushing away the \"misty, granular surface\" to unearth the object before lifting it. The caption implies this with the later term \"excavated boat,\" but it fails to describe the actual process of excavation. Additionally, the description misses key dynamic details that would likely be present, such as the fine, granular material trickling off the boat as it is uncovered and lifted, which would emphasize its discovery. The description of the hands as merely \"pale\" is also insufficient for a close-up shot; details about their slenderness, the condition of the nails, or the precise manner in which they cradle the delicate boat would add significant clarity and better convey the careful, deliberate tone of the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a black-and-white, close-up shot, a pair of slender, pale human hands meticulously brushes away a misty, granular surface, revealing a small, dark object beneath. As the hands carefully excavate the soil, fine particles trickle off, gradually uncovering a model boat caked in dirt. The boat features a distinct hull and a short, thin mast protruding from its deck. The hands, with neatly trimmed nails, gently cradle the delicate boat, lifting it with precision and care, highlighting the moment of discovery.",
