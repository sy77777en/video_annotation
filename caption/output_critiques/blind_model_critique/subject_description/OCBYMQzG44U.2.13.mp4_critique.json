    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot of a surreal, flooded interior space. The low, water-level perspective looks through an arched tunnel, its walls and vaulted ceiling covered in uniform white tiles, toward a larger, hazy, and brightly lit circular room in the distance. The lower half of the scene is filled with rippling, murky green water, creating a stark contrast with the sterile white tiles. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the unsettling and dreamlike atmosphere of the liminal space. The immersive viewpoint is used to emphasize the environment itself rather than directing attention to a particular object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as an architectural scenery shot and captures the core elements of a flooded, tiled space, it relies too heavily on subjective and interpretive language, such as \"surreal,\" \"unsettling,\" and \"dreamlike,\" which violates the instruction to avoid emotional adjectives. The explanation for the lack of a main subject is also overly analytical, explaining the director's intent (\"The immersive viewpoint is used to emphasize the environment\") rather than simply describing the scene. The description could be improved by focusing more on concrete visual details. For instance, instead of just \"rippling, murky green water,\" you could describe the specific quality of the ripples, such as slow and gentle, and note if the water's surface reflects the white tiles of the ceiling. The \"uniform white tiles\" could be described with more texture, specifying if they are glossy, creating sharp reflections, or matte, and if the grout lines form a distinct grid pattern. Additionally, the description of the light in the distant room as \"brightly lit\" could be more specific, noting if it is a diffuse, cool-toned glow that casts soft shadows or a harsh, direct light source. Condensing the description of the perspective and removing the interpretive sentences would result in a more direct and objective caption that adheres more closely to the guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures an architectural scene of a flooded interior space. The perspective is from a low, water-level angle, looking through an arched tunnel with walls and a vaulted ceiling covered in glossy white tiles, which form a distinct grid pattern. The lower half of the scene is filled with slow, gentle ripples of murky green water, reflecting the white tiles above. In the distance, a larger circular room is visible, illuminated by a diffuse, cool-toned glow that casts soft shadows. The focus is on the unique environment, highlighting the contrast between the water and the tiled surfaces.",
