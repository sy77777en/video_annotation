    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit, wood-paneled room, several humanoid figures with metallic, silver-colored skin are gathered. The primary focus is on an interaction in the foreground. A figure, seen from behind, wears a green military-style uniform, including a peaked cap with a red band, and holds a silver tray. On the tray rests a single, small white cup. Facing this military figure is another silver-skinned man with styled silver hair, wearing a dark, ribbed vest over a dark shirt and a yellow tie. In the background, other silver-skinned figures stand in groups. One man on the left has a silver beard and hair and is dressed in a dark suit with a blue tie and a blue pocket square. Other background figures are similarly attired in dark suits.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **\"The video is set in an indoor space filled with humanoid subjects dressed in suits. The focus is on one subject wearing a green military uniform, holding a tray with a cup on it. In front of him stands another subject in formal attire. At first, only the head of the subject in the green uniform is visible at the bottom of the frame. As the camera moves, it gradually shifts focus to the cup on the tray. The upper body of the subject in green becomes faintly visible and blurred in the right foreground, while the upper body of the suited subject in front of him is also partially visible and slightly out of focus.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively identifies the main subjects and their clothing, but it misses the central action and key contextual details that would be apparent in a video. For example, the description is static, stating the silver-skinned man is \"holding a silver tray,\" whereas the video likely shows him in the act of extending the tray and offering the cup to the military figure, who might be subtly leaning forward to accept it. The caption also fails to specify the nature of the figure in the uniform; if the video shows their hands or the back of their neck, it would be crucial to note whether they are human or also have metallic skin, which would significantly alter the scene's interpretation. Furthermore, the facial expressions are omitted; the man serving might have a neutral, machine-like expression, while the bearded man in the suit could be observing the interaction with a look of intense scrutiny, adding a layer of tension. The description of the \"green military-style uniform\" could be more specific by mentioning any visible insignia, such as gold epaulets or a specific emblem on the back, which would help define the character's authority. Lastly, the \"small white cup\" is vague; describing it as a delicate, handleless porcelain cup, perhaps with steam rising from it, would provide a more vivid and complete picture of the scene.",
