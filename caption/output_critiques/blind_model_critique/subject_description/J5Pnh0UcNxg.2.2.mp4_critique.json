    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot of a dimly lit bedroom at night. The scene reveals a dark-colored trunk with a pink interior, sitting open on the floor next to a white, three-drawer dresser, before a slow pan to the right shows a dark doorway leading into a hallway where a faint, cool light emanates from the distance. There is no main subject, as the focus is on establishing a mysterious and suspenseful atmosphere through the low-key lighting and shadowy environment. The camera's movement across the space serves to build tension by exploring the setting itself rather than focusing on a particular object or character.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the scene as an interior scenery shot and describes the camera's panning motion. However, it violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives by describing the atmosphere as \"mysterious and suspenseful\" and the camera's purpose as building \"tension.\" The explanation for the lack of a main subject is also overly interpretative and lengthy. The description of the subjects could be more detailed; for instance, the \"dark-colored trunk\" could be imagined as a vintage, dark brown leather trunk with tarnished brass latches, and the \"white, three-drawer dresser\" could be a simple wooden piece with a slightly chipped surface and a single, unlit lamp on top. Furthermore, the description of the light in the hallway as \"cool\" is borderline subjective and could be more objectively described by its color, such as a \"faint blue-white light.\" The caption should focus purely on these visual facts, allowing the viewer to infer the mood, and should condense the final two sentences into a single, brief statement explaining that the focus is on the environment itself.",
