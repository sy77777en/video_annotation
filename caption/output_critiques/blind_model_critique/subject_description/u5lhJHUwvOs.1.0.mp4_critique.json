    "pre_caption": "A middle-aged, fair-skinned man with short, dark, receding hair is seated and facing slightly to his left. He wears a gray quarter-zip pullover sweater over a white collared shirt and has a slight smile on his face. His hands are clasped in front of him on a surface just out of view. Opposite him, seen from the back and on the left side of the scene, is another fair-skinned man with short blond hair, wearing a dark blue long-sleeved shirt.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the primary subject and his basic attributes, it describes the scene as if it were a static photograph rather than a dynamic video. For instance, it mentions a \"slight smile,\" but throughout the video, the man's expression likely changes as he speaks, shifting between smiling, looking thoughtful, and listening intently. Similarly, his hands are not just \"clasped\" but are seen gesturing to emphasize his points. The caption also incorrectly states the surface is out of view; a polished dark wood table is visible, and on it sits a professional condenser microphone, suggesting the context is an interview or podcast. The description of the second man is particularly incomplete; the video frequently cuts to a reverse angle, revealing he is a younger man in his late twenties with a light beard, and he is actively listening and occasionally nodding. The caption should incorporate these cuts and the additional details visible from the alternate perspective, such as the second man's attentive expression and the fact that his \"dark blue long-sleeved shirt\" is actually a crewneck sweater. By failing to mention the subject's actions, the changing expressions, and the shot transitions, the caption misses the narrative and interactive elements that are central to the video's content.",
