    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle shot, a woman with light skin and blonde hair, dressed in a white outfit, lies on her back. Directly above her hangs a lamp with a circular, greenish lampshade, which is ringed by a bright, orange-yellow light, appearing as if it is on fire. In the upper right, a second person is partially visible from the waist down, standing and wearing a white t-shirt and red shorts.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the bird's-eye perspective and the main subjects, but it misses several key details and contains a minor contradiction. The description of the table's yellow rim \"appearing as if it is on fire\" could be more specific; in the video, this is clearly an animated, flickering LED light integrated into the table's edge, not actual fire or a simple reflection. The caption also completely omits the two tall glasses filled with a pink beverage and a small white bowl of snacks resting in the center of the green table, which are central to the scene. The description of the woman is a bit general; her \"white outfit\" is a sleeveless sundress, and she is not just sitting but leaning forward with her elbows on the table, looking down at it. Furthermore, the description of the second person is contradictory, stating they are visible \"from the waist down\" while also mentioning their \"white t-shirt.\" In the video, this person is visible from the upper chest down, and their stance suggests they are placing one of the glasses on the table. Finally, mentioning that the woman is sitting in a white, wire-frame patio chair would add a useful visual anchor. Incorporating these specifics would provide a much more accurate and vivid representation of the scene.",
