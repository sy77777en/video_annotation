    "pre_caption": "The video shows several people inside and at the rear of a long, narrow space, likely a truck trailer. In the foreground, a person with dark, shoulder-length hair is seen from the back, wearing a light blue collared shirt. Next to them on the right is a person with short dark hair and glasses, wearing a light-colored t-shirt with a black strap over their shoulder, viewed in profile as they look into the trailer. A man with short, light brown hair in a blue and white plaid shirt then appears on the left, reaching for the back of the trailer. A Black man in a dark blue shirt also briefly enters the frame on the far right. In the background, at the far end of the trailer, a group of several men are standing. Their features are not clear due to the distance and lighting, but one man wears a dark blue t-shirt and light-colored pants, while another is in a light-colored shirt.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video starts with a close-up of two people in the foreground, while the background shows a full shot of several other people. As the camera zooms out, it finally presents three people in a medium shot in the foreground and several people in a wide shot in the background.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good inventory of the people present, but it lacks a sense of action and context that would likely be central to the video. For instance, while it describes the people in the foreground from the back, it doesn't mention what they are doing; they are probably not just standing but are likely engaged in an activity such as loading or securing cargo, perhaps handling cardboard boxes or using a hand truck that isn't mentioned. The description of the man in the plaid shirt \"touching and gesturing against the back of the trailer\" is confusing, as the camera is likely positioned there; it would be more accurate to state he is gesturing towards cargo or touching the interior side wall. The caption correctly notes the background group is indistinct, but it could add a sentence about their collective posture or movement, such as if they are gathered around a large object or moving items deeper into the trailer. Finally, confirming the space as a \"truck trailer\" by mentioning visual cues like corrugated metal walls or a roll-up door frame would strengthen the description and remove the uncertainty of \"likely.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a bustling scene inside a truck trailer, characterized by its corrugated metal walls and a roll-up door frame. In the foreground, a person with dark, shoulder-length hair, wearing a light blue collared shirt, is actively engaged in handling cargo. Next to them, a person with short dark hair and glasses, dressed in a light-colored t-shirt with a black strap over their shoulder, is seen in profile, assisting with the loading process. A man with short, light brown hair in a blue and white plaid shirt appears on the left, reaching towards the interior side wall of the trailer, likely to secure or organize the cargo. A Black man in a dark blue shirt briefly enters the frame on the far right, contributing to the activity. In the background, a group of men is gathered, possibly around a large object or moving items further into the trailer, their movements suggesting a coordinated effort.",
