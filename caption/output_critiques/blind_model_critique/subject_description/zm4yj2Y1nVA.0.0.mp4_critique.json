    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit room, a dark wooden chair with a spindle back is partially illuminated. The surrounding walls are completely covered with numerous rectangular, aged-looking papers. A dark, simple cross hangs on the wall to the left of the chair. The perspective then rotates clockwise and tilts, shifting the focus from the chair to the cross. As the rotation continues, the cross appears to invert, concluding with a view of it upside-down against the paper-covered wall.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The shot begins by showcasing a wide shot of a dimly lit room with papers plastered on the walls. On the floor, there is a chair, and a beam of light shines on it. On the left wall, there is a cross. As the camera moves in, it rotates clockwise, making the cross the focal point, and by the end, it nearly completes a 180-degree rotation, aiming at an upside-down cross.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the sequence of events and the primary subjects, but it lacks specificity that was present in the video, particularly regarding the atmospheric elements. The \"aged-looking papers\" were not just generic; they were covered in what looked like frantic, overlapping charcoal sketches of faces and symbols, with some being torn and layered over others, which is a key detail for the scene's tone. The description of the cross's inversion is also slightly ambiguous; the video achieves this effect by having the camera perform a complete 180-degree roll on its axis during the clockwise rotation, making the entire room appear upside down, rather than the cross inverting on its own. Furthermore, the \"dimly lit\" description could be enhanced by noting that the partial illumination comes from a single, flickering light source off-screen, causing the shadows from the chair's spindles to move erratically across the wall. Finally, the chair itself appeared to be covered in a fine layer of dust, suggesting it has been untouched for a long time, which adds to the sense of a disturbed, abandoned space.",
