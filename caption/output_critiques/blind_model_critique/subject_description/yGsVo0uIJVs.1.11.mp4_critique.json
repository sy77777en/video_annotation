The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of scale and mystery in the vast, quiet deep. Dim light filters down from above, illuminating the conning tower with its various periscopes and masts, while small, bright particles drift slowly through the hazy water, enhancing the deep-sea ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the submarine as the central element, it incorrectly frames the video as a \"scenery shot\" where the \"focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject.\" A large submarine, even if partially shown, is a highly salient subject. The description should commit to describing the submarine as the main focus. The caption also uses subjective, interpretive language such as \"mystery,\" \"vast, quiet deep,\" and \"deep-sea ambiance,\" which should be replaced with objective visual details. For instance, instead of \"murky water,\" describing it as \"hazy water with limited visibility and small, bright particles drifting throughout\" is more descriptive. Furthermore, the description of \"various periscopes and masts\" might be inaccurate; in the video, these components appear to be retracted into the streamlined structure of the conning tower, so it would be more precise to describe the tower's shape and the housings for this equipment. The color \"turquoise-blue\" is also very specific; a more general description like \"blue light filtering from the surface\" might be more accurate, as the light appears to be a standard deep-water blue that illuminates the top of the dark gray hull. The caption should be revised to be a direct, objective description of the submarine within its aquatic environment, removing the sentence that explains the shot's intended effect.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures the top portion of a large, dark gray submarine submerged in hazy water with limited visibility. The focus is on the submarine itself, highlighting its streamlined conning tower with retracted periscopes and masts. Blue light filters from the surface, illuminating the tower and the hull. Small, bright particles drift slowly through the water, adding to the visual detail of the underwater scene.",
