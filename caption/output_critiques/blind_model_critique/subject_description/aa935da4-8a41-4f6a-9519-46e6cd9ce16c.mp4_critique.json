    "pre_caption": "A light-skinned man with a lean, muscular build, short dark hair, and facial stubble stands on a road. He is shirtless, wearing only blue and white plaid boxer shorts. At one point, his left arm is not visible, appearing to be missing from the shoulder, while at another moment, both arms are present, and he places his right hand on his right thigh. In the background, a car is visible with its headlights on.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good baseline description of the man and his actions, but it misses key visual details that would convey the scene's atmosphere and urgency. For instance, the mention of \"headlights\" implies the scene is at night or in low light, a crucial detail that is omitted. The description could be improved by specifying that the man is illuminated by the harsh, singular light of the car's headlights, which casts a long shadow in front of him as he moves toward the camera. While the caption correctly notes his limp and hand clutching his thigh, it fails to describe his facial expression, which likely shows clear signs of pain or distress, such as a grimace or clenched jaw. The term \"a road\" is too general; specifying it as a dark, empty asphalt road would provide better context. Furthermore, the car's role is understated. Instead of just being \"in the background,\" it could be described as stationary behind the man, acting as the sole light source for the scene. Lastly, the phrase \"clutching the root of his thigh\" is slightly awkward and could be rephrased more naturally as \"clutching his upper thigh,\" and the description of his swinging arm could be more specific, such as \"his left arm swings loosely for balance.\"",
