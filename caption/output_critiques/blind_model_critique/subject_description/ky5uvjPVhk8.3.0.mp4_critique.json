    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot featuring a tranquil garden path bordered by lush greenery and vibrant autumn foliage, with a traditional wooden building displaying clean architectural lines and natural materials. The focus is on the harmonious blend of nature and architecture, highlighting the serene atmosphere and the scale of the environment rather than any individual subject. There is no main subject because the intent is to immerse the viewer in the peaceful ambiance and visual balance of the garden and its surroundings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot but lacks the specific visual details that make the scene distinct. While it mentions a \"garden path,\" it fails to specify that it is composed of large, irregular grey flagstones interspersed with patches of soft green moss. The description of \"lush greenery and vibrant autumn foliage\" is too general; the video prominently features low, manicured shrubs and the striking contrast of a single Japanese maple tree with delicate, deep-crimson leaves against a backdrop of evergreen pines. The \"traditional wooden building\" is described with abstract terms like \"clean architectural lines,\" but the caption should include concrete features visible in the video, such as its dark grey tiled roof with slightly upswept eaves, the light-colored wood of its raised veranda, and its translucent paper shoji screens. Furthermore, the final two sentences explaining the lack of a main subject are redundant and interpretive; a single, more direct statement that the video captures a wide, static view of the garden, focusing on the overall composition, would be more effective and less subjective.",
