    "pre_caption": "The main subject is a woman with fair skin, short black hair, and dark eyes, who is smiling at the camera. She wears a cream-colored coat over a yellow knit turtleneck sweater and blue jeans. A pair of sunglasses rests on top of her head, and she has a small earring in her right ear. She carries a light-colored shoulder bag and holds a phone with a colorful charm. In the background, several other people, both men and women, are visible. They are dressed in casual, cool-weather attire and are standing, walking, or sitting in the area behind the main woman.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject and her primary clothing items, but it misses several key visual details and nuances of her action that were present in the video. For instance, the \"high-necked top\" underneath her yellow V-neck sweater is a distinct white, creating a noticeable color contrast that the description omits. The \"colorful charm\" is more specifically a multi-colored beaded bracelet on her right wrist, and the two earrings in her left ear consist of a small silver hoop and a tiny diamond stud, details that would add precision. While the caption states she is smiling, it fails to capture the dynamic nature of her expression; throughout the video, she briefly glances away towards a street performer to her left, laughs, and then returns her gaze to the camera, making her interaction feel more candid than a static smile. Furthermore, the description of her phone is incomplete; she is holding a black phone with a clear case, and a small, woven charm is attached to the case, not worn on her wrist as stated. Finally, the background description is overly generic; mentioning a more specific secondary subject, such as the man in a bright red jacket who walks directly behind her or the couple sharing a bench in the midground, would have provided a better sense of the bustling urban environment without detracting from the main focus.",
