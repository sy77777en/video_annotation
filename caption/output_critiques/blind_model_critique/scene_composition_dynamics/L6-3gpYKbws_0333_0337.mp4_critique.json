The view shifts from above the clear, turquoise water to an underwater perspective.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the location and general activity, but it could be more precise in its description of the point of view and the transition between scenes. Stating \"The view shifts\" is vague; a more descriptive phrase like \"From a perspective just above the surface, the camera smoothly submerges\" would better capture the motion. The description of the subjects is slightly confusing, as it mentions \"a person\" swimming away and then \"A person\" snorkeling, making it unclear if this is the same individual. The underwater scene is described minimally with just \"rock formations\"; adding details like the clarity of the water allowing sunlight to dapple the sandy bottom or the presence of small fish swimming near the rocks would create a more complete picture without being excessively detailed. Furthermore, the sentence connecting the snorkeler to the scenery is awkward (\"A person is swimming and snorkeling in the water, which reveals underwater rock formations\"); the camera's movement reveals the formations, not the person's action. Finally, while the description of the white building with a \"green interior\" is specific, it lacks context on how the interior is visible—for instance, if the building is an open-air shelter or has large, open doorways.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene unfolds at a beach in Klein Curaçao during the daytime, under a blue sky dotted with white clouds. From a perspective just above the surface, the camera smoothly submerges into the clear, turquoise water, transitioning to an underwater view. On the shore, a white sandy beach is bordered by low green vegetation and a few simple, rustic buildings. One building stands out with its white exterior, green doors, and a corrugated metal roof, appearing as an open-air shelter with large, open doorways. A person is seen swimming and snorkeling, while the camera reveals underwater rock formations, with sunlight dappling the sandy bottom and small fish darting near the rocks.
