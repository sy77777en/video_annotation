    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor environment, likely the aftermath of a party. The lighting is low with a warm, reddish-purple cast, and the entire view is distorted by a heavy chromatic aberration effect, creating red and blue light fringes around objects. A man in a patterned shirt and sunglasses lies on his back on a light-brown textured surface, where small red and blue confetti pieces are scattered. A quick, blurry camera movement shows another person with blonde hair and a white, fluffy garment. A white towel and the top of a green bottle are also visible in the cluttered space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the disorienting visual effects and general sequence of events, but it could be improved by specifying the point of view and providing more concrete details instead of ambiguous descriptions. The chaotic motion strongly suggests a first-person or handheld perspective, which is a crucial detail for contextualizing the scene. The phrase \"likely the aftermath of a party\" is speculative and should be removed; describing the confetti and bottle is sufficient. The description of the surface as \"light-brown textured\" is vague; specifying it as a fabric couch or a shag rug would be more informative. Similarly, \"patterned shirt\" could be more descriptive, such as a \"dark shirt with a floral pattern,\" and the \"white, fluffy garment\" could be identified as a \"white faux-fur jacket.\" The camera motion could be described more precisely, for instance, as a \"rapid whip pan\" instead of a \"quick, blurry camera movement.\" Most importantly, the final action is understated. Instead of just stating a third person \"enters\" and \"occupies the frame,\" it would be more descriptive to detail their action, such as \"a third person in a black t-shirt leans down directly into the lens, their face filling and obscuring the view.\"",
