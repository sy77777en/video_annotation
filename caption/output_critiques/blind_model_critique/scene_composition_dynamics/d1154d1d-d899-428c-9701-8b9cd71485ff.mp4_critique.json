    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a brightly lit indoor hallway with a distinct retro aesthetic. A wide, vibrant orange runner extends down the center of the floor, bordered on both sides by muted gray-brown carpeting. Symmetrically placed along the walls are orange armchairs and small, dark wooden side tables. In the background, a doorway with glass panels is visible. A young child wearing small, iridescent, rainbow-colored wings stands in the middle of the orange runner, holding a globe of the Earth. The perspective is from over a solid yellow surface that occupies the bottom of the view, and the child's mouth moves slightly as if speaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the point of view is imprecise; stating it is \"from over a solid yellow surface\" conflates the camera's position with what is likely an overlay. The caption should first establish the camera's perspective, such as a static, eye-level shot, and then separately identify the yellow element as an overlay, specifying if it functions as a subtitle bar or a graphic frame. The description of motion is limited to the child's mouth; in the video, the child makes subtle movements, causing the iridescent wings to shimmer and catch the light, and she shifts her weight slightly while holding the globe. The caption also misses the texture of the walls, which appear to be covered in a patterned, textured wallpaper with a subtle geometric design, contributing to the retro aesthetic. Furthermore, the source of the bright lighting is not mentioned; the hallway is illuminated by evenly spaced, circular, recessed lights in the ceiling, which cast soft, uniform light throughout the space. Finally, the description of the runner as extending \"vertically... and... horizontally\" is slightly awkward; describing it as a T-shaped pattern would be more concise.",
