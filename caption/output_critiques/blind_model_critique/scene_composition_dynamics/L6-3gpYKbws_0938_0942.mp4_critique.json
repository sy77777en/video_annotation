    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with an underwater view of a rocky seabed in clear, shallow water. The camera then rises to the surface, revealing a tropical shoreline during the daytime under an overcast sky. The beach is covered in pebbles and rocks, where several people are present near the water's edge. Lush green trees line the shore, and in the background, thatched-roof huts are visible. A large, forested mountain rises behind the beach. The water gently ripples, creating a split view between the underwater rocks and the scene on land.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the sequence of events and the main elements of the scene, but it could be improved by adding more specific visual texture and integrating the description of the camera's motion more dynamically. The initial underwater description of a \"rocky seabed\" is generic; the video shows dark, volcanic-looking stones, some covered in green algae, with sunlight creating shifting patterns on the seafloor. The transition could be described more vividly; as the camera breaks the surface, water droplets momentarily cling to the lens before clearing. The caption mentions the \"split view\" as a final point, but it is the central framing device of the main shot; it would be more effective to state that the camera settles into a split-level perspective. The description of the people is vague; they are seen wading in the shallows near the shore, which provides better context. Finally, while the sky is \"overcast,\" it is not a flat grey but filled with bright, defined white clouds, and the pebbles on the beach are a mix of dark grey and white, glistening from the water. Explicitly stating the first-person point of view would also clarify the viewer's perspective.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene opens with a first-person view of an underwater landscape, showcasing dark, volcanic stones scattered across the seabed, some adorned with green algae. Sunlight dances across the seafloor, creating shifting patterns. As the camera ascends, it breaks the surface, and water droplets momentarily cling to the lens before clearing. The view settles into a split-level perspective, capturing both the underwater world and the vibrant scene above. The tropical shoreline is revealed, lined with lush green trees and dotted with thatched-roof huts. A large, forested mountain looms in the background. The beach, covered in a mix of dark grey and white pebbles glistening from the water, hosts several people wading in the shallows near the shore. The sky is filled with bright, defined white clouds, adding texture to the overcast atmosphere.",
