    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a dimly lit living room with a stylized, low-poly aesthetic, viewed from behind a large, red-cushioned couch. As the camera pulls back, it reveals two white, geometric figures sitting on the couch, facing a vintage-style television on a wooden media console. The TV screen shows a title card for \"WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?\" sponsored by \"RITZ.\" To the left of the TV is a potted plant, and several empty, dark picture frames are arranged on the muted green wall behind it. A text overlay in the bottom-left corner reads \"[S] : ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2001)\". Another overlay appears in the lower-left area, stating \"19 million viewers\" and \"32% of UK population (2000)\".",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the main components of the scene, but it misses several key dynamic and textural details that would be prominent in the video. The description of the room as \"dimly lit\" is incomplete; it fails to mention the significant, flickering blue and white light emanating from the television, which casts dynamic shadows and highlights on the geometric figures, the red couch, and the coffee table. The caption describes the \"WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?\" title card as a static image, whereas in the video, it is an active animation with its characteristic shimmering and sound-cued visual effects. Furthermore, the description of the text overlays is too simplistic; the \"19 million viewers\" statistic does not just appear but animates in, with the numbers rapidly counting up before settling. The \"low-poly aesthetic\" is mentioned, but the caption omits the visible, stylized wood grain texture on the media console and the subtle, repeating pattern on the couch's fabric, which are key to the scene's visual style. Finally, the upward camera movement is not just a simple motion; it is a slow tilt that gradually reveals a plain, unadorned ceiling and a simple, spherical ceiling light fixture, elements that are entirely missing from the description.",
