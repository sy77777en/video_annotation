    "pre_caption": "An outdoor scene at an airport is depicted at either dawn or dusk. A plain white, unmarked passenger airplane sits stationary on a dark asphalt runway, which is detailed with white painted markings. In the background, winding taxiways and the silhouettes of distant buildings are visible against a sky with a warm, orange hue. White subtitles are present as an overlay at the bottom of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's use of \"dawn or dusk\" is ambiguous; the video clearly depicts dusk, with the sun below the horizon creating a deep orange and purple gradient. The aircraft is positioned on a wet concrete apron, not a \"dark asphalt runway,\" and the resulting reflections of the sky and the plane's lights on the damp surface are a prominent visual element that the description omits. The taxiway markings are yellow, not white as stated. While the airplane is \"stationary,\" this fails to capture the blinking red and green navigation lights on its wingtips and the subtle heat haze shimmering from its engines, suggesting recent activity. The description of the plane as \"plain white, unmarked\" is an oversimplification, as faint gray airline branding is visible on the tail fin. Furthermore, the \"silhouettes of distant buildings\" could be more precisely identified as an airport terminal and a control tower, and the caption misses the movement of ground service vehicles, such as a baggage cart, driving along the midground taxiways.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures an outdoor scene at an airport during dusk, with the sun below the horizon creating a deep orange and purple gradient in the sky. A faintly branded white passenger airplane is stationary on a wet concrete apron, reflecting the vibrant sky and the plane's blinking red and green navigation lights. Yellow taxiway markings are visible, and subtle heat haze shimmers from the engines, hinting at recent activity. In the background, an airport terminal and control tower are silhouetted against the sky, while ground service vehicles, including a baggage cart, move along the midground taxiways. White subtitles overlay the bottom of the screen.",
