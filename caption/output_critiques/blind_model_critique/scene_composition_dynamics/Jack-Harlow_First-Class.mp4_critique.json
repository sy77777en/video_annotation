    "pre_caption": "A third-person over-the-hip POV shot frames a character from the hip up, seen from behind as they look out a large window onto a sprawling cityscape at night. The entire scene is presented in black and white. Below, the dark urban landscape is illuminated by a dense pattern of lights from building windows and streets. The subject, positioned centrally, wears a dark, puffy, hooded jacket. The vertical frames of the window are visible on either side, and the video is presented within a white border.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person over-the-hip POV shot framing the character from the hip up.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the black-and-white aesthetic, the central subject, and the cityscape, it misses key details and contains some inaccuracies. The term \"third-person over-the-hip POV shot\" is contradictory; a more precise description would be a \"low-angle third-person shot from behind the subject,\" as the camera is positioned near their waist, looking slightly up. The caption fails to mention any details about the interior room, such as the faint reflection of the subject's own silhouette on the window pane, which is visible and helps establish the sense of being inside looking out. Furthermore, it describes a static scene, omitting the subtle motion present in the video; for instance, the distant city lights twinkle and faint streaks from moving traffic are visible, and the character subtly shifts their weight. The description of the \"puffy, hooded jacket\" could be more specific by noting that the hood is pulled up, completely obscuring the character's head and enhancing their anonymity. Finally, the \"white border\" should be clarified as a digital overlay framing the video, distinct from the \"vertical frames of the window,\" which appear as thin, dark metal mullions.",

The subject, centrally positioned, wears a dark, puffy jacket with the hood pulled up, completely obscuring their head and enhancing their anonymity.
