    "pre_caption": "This outdoor night scene is set on a city street next to a stone building with foliage overhead. In the background, a dimly lit alley is visible, containing a distant figure and a sign that reads \"SLOW.\" The focus of the shot shifts from the background figure to a man in the foreground, bringing his profile into sharp relief against the now-blurry alley. The scene is characterized by its dark, cool-toned lighting. Overlays are present at the bottom of the screen: in the lower-left corner, the white text \"RACK FOCUS\" appears next to a purple icon, and in the lower-right corner, the text \"FIGHT CLUB (1999)\" is displayed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the core rack focus and the main subjects, but it misses several key textural and environmental details that define the scene's atmosphere. The \"stone building\" is more specifically a dark, damp brick wall with visible water stains, and the \"foliage overhead\" is a single, large tree branch with dense leaves that creates a natural frame in the upper portion of the shot. The lighting, described as \"cool-toned,\" is more complex; it originates from a single, buzzing streetlamp off-screen left, casting a stark white light on the foreground man, while the alley is bathed in a contrasting, sickly yellow glow from an unseen source. The caption omits that the \"SLOW\" sign is not a standing sign but is stenciled in faded white paint directly onto the wet asphalt of the alley. Furthermore, the man in the foreground is not static; he brings a cigarette to his lips just as the focus shifts, and a thin trail of smoke becomes visible in the sharp focus. Finally, the description of the woman is incomplete; after exiting the door, she walks briskly past the foreground man without acknowledging him before exiting the frame on the right, a movement that adds a layer of narrative context to the shot.",
