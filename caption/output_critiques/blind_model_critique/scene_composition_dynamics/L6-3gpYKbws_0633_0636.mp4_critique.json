    "pre_caption": "The scene is set in a tropical bay during the day, viewed from the water's surface. A large, steep, green mountain dominates the left side of the view, where several sailboats are anchored. To the right, a lush, tree-covered shoreline extends into the distance. Above, the sky is blue with scattered white clouds. The perspective shifts from the rippling surface of the clear, greenish-blue water, dipping below to reveal a rocky seabed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the basic geography and the over-to-underwater transition, it lacks specific details that would bring the scene to life. The description of the \"rocky seabed\" is too generic; in the video, the seabed consists of dark, jagged volcanic rocks covered in patches of green algae, with small schools of silver fish darting between them. The caption also misses the dynamic quality of the water's surface, which isn't just \"rippling\" but also shows sunlight creating dancing patterns of light on the seabed as the camera submerges. The point of view is more specifically a handheld camera being lowered, which creates a personal, immersive feel that the phrase \"the perspective shifts\" doesn't fully convey. Furthermore, the description of the above-water scene, while correct, could be more integrated; stating that the \"seawater occupying the lower half\" feels clinical, whereas describing it as a split-level view from the start would be more natural. Finally, the caption omits any motion in the environment, such as the gentle swaying of palm trees on the shoreline or the slow drift of the clouds, which are visible in the initial part of the shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene unfolds in a tropical bay during the day, captured from a split-level view that immerses you in both the vibrant above-water and underwater worlds. On the left, a towering, steep green mountain provides a dramatic backdrop to several anchored sailboats. To the right, a lush shoreline lined with gently swaying palm trees stretches into the distance, while above, the sky is a brilliant blue with clouds slowly drifting by. The handheld camera lowers, creating a personal and immersive experience as it transitions from the dynamic water surface, where sunlight dances in patterns, to beneath the waves. Below, the seabed reveals dark, jagged volcanic rocks adorned with patches of green algae, with small schools of silver fish darting between them, bringing the underwater scene to life.",
