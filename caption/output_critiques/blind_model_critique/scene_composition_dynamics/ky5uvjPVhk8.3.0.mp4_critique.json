    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, moves along a stone-paved path in an outdoor Japanese garden during daylight. The setting features a traditional wooden building with yellow walls and large windows on the right, supported by dark brown beams and surrounded by a low stone border filled with small blue-gray pebbles. To the left, the path curves gently past manicured shrubs, a large rock, and a pond partially visible through the trees. The garden is lush with green foliage, interspersed with trees displaying red and orange autumn leaves. A person pushing a stroller is seen ahead on the path, and the overall environment is calm and well-maintained, with no overlays or additional visual elements present.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately establishes the first-person perspective and the general setting of a Japanese garden in autumn, it misses several key visual details that define the scene's character and texture. The \"stone-paved path\" is actually composed of large, irregular gray flagstones with dark green moss growing in the gaps, and the camera's movement creates a sense of dappled sunlight shifting across them. The description of the building is incomplete; its \"large windows\" are traditional shoji screens with delicate wooden lattices, not plain glass. The \"pond\" is more than just partially visible; the camera pans slightly to the left to reveal a classic stone lantern (a tōrō) at its edge and the distinct orange and white patterns of several large koi fish swimming near the surface. Furthermore, the caption omits that the camera briefly tilts up to frame the brilliant red leaves of a Japanese maple against the bright, clear sky, a deliberate moment of focus that breaks the simple forward motion. Finally, the person with the stroller is not just \"ahead on the path\"; they are much closer at the start and walk away from the camera, eventually turning a corner and disappearing from view, which provides a sense of depth and progression to the shot.",
