The shot remains a close-up, capturing the individual from the shoulders up.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the core lighting and the initial rack focus, but it could be more precise about the environment and camera movement. The \"dimly lit indoor setting\" is vague; given the cool blue light on the subject and the warm background bokeh, specifying the setting as a nightclub or a neon-lit arcade would provide better context. The \"reddish-orange halos\" could be more descriptively identified as the out-of-focus glow from distant bar signs or stage lights. The description of the camera work is also ambiguous; \"transitions into a close-up\" does not clarify if this is a slow, continuous dolly-in that accompanies the focus pull or a hard cut to a tighter framing. Specifying this motion is crucial. Furthermore, while the subject's description is concise, adding that they are facing forward with a neutral expression and that the top of a dark, textured jacket is visible would ground them in the scene more effectively without being overly detailed. Finally, the material of the \"large, flat, metallic earrings\" could be more specific, such as \"brushed aluminum discs,\" which becomes clear as the focus sharpens.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a neon-lit nightclub or arcade, the scene is enveloped in cool, blue light, contrasted by the warm, reddish-orange glow of distant bar signs or stage lights in the out-of-focus background on the right. A person with short, light-blue hair and large, brushed aluminum disc earrings gradually comes into sharp focus from an initial blur. The camera executes a slow, continuous dolly-in that accompanies the focus pull, transitioning into a close-up that captures the individual from the shoulders up.
