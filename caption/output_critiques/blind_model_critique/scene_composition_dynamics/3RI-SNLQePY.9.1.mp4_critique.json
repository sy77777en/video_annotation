    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, is set within a dark, circular arena with red glowing accents. The back wall is dominated by a large, curved bank of screens displaying various stylized images, including an anime-style woman in a kimono, a robotic-looking man with an afro, and a graphic of a gun with Japanese text. In the center of the arena, a spherical, mechanical object glows with purple energy as it hovers above the floor. The character's left hand holds a yellow device displaying \"90% LIFE,\" while the gloved right hand gestures and points, creating a small flash of light at the fingertip. Overlay elements include a \"BATTERY LIFE\" bar and the word \"CYBEHOLDER\" at the top of the screen, and a momentary \"RELOAD\" prompt in the center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the main elements, but it could better convey the scene's dynamic, game-like nature. The description of the hand \"gesturing and posing\" is vague; the video shows the right hand specifically forming a finger-gun shape, from which the flash of light erupts, suggesting a weapon-firing action. The \"spherical, mechanical object\" is not static; it slowly rotates and pulses with a soft purple light, with faint electrical arcs occasionally flickering across its metallic surface. The images on the large screens are not still photos but are subtly animated loops. The caption also creates confusion by listing a \"BATTERY LIFE\" bar and a device showing \"90% LIFE\" without clarifying their relationship; the video shows the \"BATTERY LIFE\" overlay is a green bar representing weapon energy, which depletes slightly after the flash, while the \"90% LIFE\" on the wrist-mounted device is a separate health meter. Furthermore, the \"red glowing accents\" are specifically thin light strips embedded in the seams between the dark floor and wall panels. Finally, the first-person perspective is enhanced by a slight, continuous head-bob motion, which gives a sense of physical presence and movement that the caption omits.",
