    "pre_caption": "The video takes place indoors in a softly lit room with large, light-colored architectural structures featuring tall, arched openings. The background displays a gradient of muted blue and pink tones, suggesting a stylized or painted sky. The walls are smooth and pale, with two prominent arches that have carved face-like symbols—one with a frown and one with a smile—adding a distinctive visual element. A person with long, dark, wet hair and wearing a white, semi-transparent, patterned outfit is positioned centrally, seated or standing in front of the arches. The lighting creates gentle shadows and highlights, emphasizing the geometric shapes and the texture of the person’s clothing. No overlays such as text, icons, or watermarks are present in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the key architectural elements, such as the arches with face-like symbols, and the stylized background. However, it lacks specificity regarding the point of view and motion, which are crucial for describing a video. For instance, the video I watched was from a static, eye-level point of view that slowly zooms in on the central figure, creating a sense of focus and stillness, a detail the caption omits. The description of the structures as \"light-colored\" is vague; they are clearly made of a matte, off-white plaster, and the floor, which is not mentioned at all, is a dark, polished stone surface covered in a thin layer of water that reflects the arches. The caption's use of \"seated or standing\" is an unhelpful ambiguity; the person is standing perfectly still. Furthermore, while it mentions the person's \"wet hair,\" it fails to describe the resulting motion, such as the slow, steady dripping of water from the hair onto the simple, tunic-style white outfit and the wet floor below, which connects the subject to the environment.",
