    "pre_caption": "The scene is set within a large, symmetrical indoor hall rendered in a distinct digital style. The entire structure, including a high, coffered ceiling and multiple levels with balconies and arched doorways, is depicted as a semi-transparent, orange-hued point-cloud model against a dark, noisy background. A warm spotlight illuminates the center of the floor, which is covered in a dark, static-like texture. Within this illuminated area stand two figures in military-style uniforms, while a third figure stands further to the left in the shadows. The figures appear solid with a textured, reddish-brown surface. An overlay of white text appears at the top of the screen, presenting a subtitle that reads, \"a special security service checked all routes and locations meticulously before Hitler...\".",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback paragraph is:\n\nThe caption correctly identifies the main architectural elements and digital style, but it overlooks the scene's dynamic nature and key visual details. The point of view is not static but a slow, forward dolly shot, moving down the central axis toward the figures, which enhances the hall's depth. The entire point-cloud structure is not fixed; it constantly shimmers with a subtle, flowing motion, and the \"noisy\" background is an animated digital static effect, not a still texture. The description of the figures is too general; while they are more solid, they are still composed of the same dense, orange particles as the environment, and their military uniforms are distinguished by darker orange armored plates on the chest and shoulders and glowing orange visors on their helmets. The caption also misses the volumetric effect of the spotlights, whose beams are visible as they cut through the hazy, particle-filled air. Finally, the overlay \"[9]\" is not a static number but is part of a countdown, as it was seen changing from \"[10]\" at the start of the shot, adding a sense of urgency.",
