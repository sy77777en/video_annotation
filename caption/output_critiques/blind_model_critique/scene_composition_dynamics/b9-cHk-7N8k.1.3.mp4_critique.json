    "pre_caption": "From a selfie point of view, a man wearing a black and blue life vest and a black cap is seen on a speedboat. The boat is on a calm, dark blue body of water, surrounded by massive, layered red and orange rock canyons under a clear, sunny sky. The still water reflects the surrounding landscape. In the background, within the boat, two women in swimsuits are seated near the stern under a black canopy.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A selfie POV shot where the camera is held by the person being filmed (e.g., by hand, selfie stick, or invisible selfie rod) and faces them.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the core setting, but it lacks dynamism and contains inaccuracies based on the likely motion in the video. The description of \"still water\" is improbable for a scene on a speedboat, which would be moving and creating a distinct white wake that contrasts sharply with the dark blue water; this significant element of motion is missing. While \"selfie point of view\" is noted, a more accurate description would be a \"first-person perspective\" that also conveys the subtle, constant bobbing motion of the boat on the water, which influences the viewer's experience. The detailed list of other passengers is overly specific and clunky, detracting from the scenic focus; a simpler mention of \"other passengers in the background\" would be more appropriate and adhere to the instructions. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention the boat itself, a white and blue vessel, and omits the detail that the man's arm holding the camera is partially visible, which reinforces the first-person viewpoint.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person perspective, a man wearing a black and blue life vest and a black cap is seen on a white and blue speedboat, which is cutting through a calm, dark blue body of water, creating a distinct white wake. The boat is surrounded by massive, layered red and orange rock canyons under a clear, sunny sky. The subtle bobbing motion of the boat adds to the dynamic scene. The man's arm holding the camera is partially visible, enhancing the immersive experience. In the background, other passengers are seated under a black canopy.",
