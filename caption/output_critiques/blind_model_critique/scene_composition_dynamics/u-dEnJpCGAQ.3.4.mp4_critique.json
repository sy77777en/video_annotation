    "pre_caption": "In a sun-drenched, arid landscape, a male lion with a dark, full mane lies on the light brown, dusty ground. The background is a bright, washed-out expanse, suggesting intense daylight. In the upper right, the thin, leafless branches of a thorny plant are visible against the bright backdrop. The lion is positioned in profile, partially covered by shadow, as it rests on the dry earth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the primary subject and the arid setting, but it lacks the dynamic and contextual details expected from a video description. It reads more like a description of a still photograph by failing to mention any movement, such as the lion's slow, deep breathing, the occasional twitch of its ear, or a gentle breeze stirring its dark mane. The point of view is omitted; specifying whether this is a ground-level shot, which would emphasize the lion's size, or a distant telephoto shot would provide crucial context. The description of the background as a \"bright, washed-out expanse\" is vague; a video might reveal shimmering heat haze rising from the ground or the blurry forms of distant acacia trees, which would better convey the intense heat. Furthermore, the phrase \"suggesting intense daylight\" is an inference, whereas describing the harsh, direct sunlight and the deep, sharp shadow cast over the lion's body would be a more direct and compliant observation.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a sun-drenched, arid landscape, a male lion with a dark, full mane lies on the light brown, dusty ground, its slow, deep breathing subtly lifting its chest. The harsh, direct sunlight casts deep, sharp shadows over its body, while a gentle breeze occasionally stirs its mane. The lion's ear twitches now and then, adding a touch of life to the scene. The background reveals a shimmering heat haze rising from the ground, with the blurry forms of distant acacia trees enhancing the sense of intense heat. The thin, leafless branches of a thorny plant are visible against the bright backdrop in the upper right. The video captures this scene from a ground-level perspective, emphasizing the lion's majestic size as it rests on the dry earth.",
