    "pre_caption": "An outdoor scene unfolds on a large, paved concrete expanse under a partly cloudy sky. In the center is a raised, square platform covered with green artificial turf, resembling a small putting green, with its base draped in black fabric. A red and white flagstick, topped with a red flag marked with the number '1', is situated in a hole on the green, near a single white golf ball. To the left of the platform stands a wooden A-frame structure holding a cylindrical, metallic object. A low blue mesh screen is positioned directly behind the green, and a long blue fence runs across the background, with piles of dark soil visible in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the static elements of the scene, but it completely misses the motion and the point of view, which are central to the video experience. The video is not a still shot; it's filmed from a stable, eye-level perspective that slowly pans right to follow the action. It begins with a person, who is not mentioned in the caption, lining up a putt on the green. The caption should describe this person's action of striking the white golf ball, its subsequent roll across the artificial turf, and the moment it drops into the hole. Furthermore, the caption omits that the red flag on the flagstick is fluttering in a light breeze, adding a dynamic element to the background. The description of the \"cylindrical, metallic object\" is too vague; in the video, it is clearly a large, silver-colored air cannon or launcher, a significant and unusual feature that warrants a more specific description. Finally, the video includes a small, semi-transparent brand logo as a watermark overlay in the lower-left corner, which is an important visual element that the current caption fails to mention.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a stable, eye-level perspective that slowly pans right, capturing the dynamic scene. A person is seen lining up a putt on a raised, square platform covered with green artificial turf, resembling a small putting green. The person strikes the white golf ball, which rolls smoothly across the turf and drops into the hole, marked by a red and white flagstick with a fluttering red flag numbered '1'. The flag flutters gently in a light breeze, adding movement to the scene. To the left of the platform, a large, silver-colored air cannon or launcher stands out as a unique feature. Behind the green, a low blue mesh screen and a long blue fence stretch across the background, with piles of dark soil visible in the distance.
