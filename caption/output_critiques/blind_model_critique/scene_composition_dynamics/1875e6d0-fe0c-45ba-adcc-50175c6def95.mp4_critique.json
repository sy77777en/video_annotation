    "pre_caption": "An outdoor garden scene is viewed through stalks of purple lavender in the foreground. In the background, a dense hedge of green leaves is interspersed with bright red flowers. Positioned between the foreground flowers and the background hedge, a woman wearing a dark green hoodie stands with her head tilted back. The focus of the shot shifts from the lavender to the woman.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the primary subjects and the focus pull, it lacks crucial atmospheric and contextual details that define the scene's character. It omits the time of day, which is clearly late afternoon, evident from the warm, golden sunlight filtering through the garden and casting a soft glow on the scene. The point of view is a close-up, handheld shot, creating an intimate perspective that the caption fails to mention. The description of motion is incomplete; beyond the rack focus, the lavender stalks in the foreground are gently swaying in a light breeze, adding a dynamic quality that is not captured. Furthermore, the caption misses a key detail about the subject: the woman has her eyes closed as her head is tilted back, suggesting she is savoring the moment, a detail that provides important context for her posture. The description of the focus shift could also be more integrated, as the shot begins with the lavender in sharp focus, blurring the woman, before the focus smoothly transitions to her, making her the clear subject by the end.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In the warm, golden light of late afternoon, an outdoor garden scene unfolds through a close-up, handheld shot. Stalks of purple lavender sway gently in the foreground, caught in a light breeze. Behind them, a dense hedge of green leaves is interspersed with bright red flowers. Between the lavender and the hedge, a woman in a dark green hoodie stands with her head tilted back and eyes closed, savoring the moment. The shot begins with the lavender in sharp focus, blurring the woman, before smoothly transitioning to make her the clear subject, capturing the serene atmosphere and dynamic quality of the scene.",
