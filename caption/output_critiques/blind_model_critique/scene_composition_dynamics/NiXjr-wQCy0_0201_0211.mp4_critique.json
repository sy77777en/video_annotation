    "pre_caption": "The scene takes place outdoors on a concrete surface, likely a driveway, in front of a red garage door with peeling paint and the corner of a brick building. A green and dark blue swirled bowling ball with red markings is shown in slow motion, having just crashed through the screen of an old, black, boxy CRT television. The brand name \"SHARP\" is visible on the front of the television below the broken screen. The bowling ball comes to a rest inside the cavity of the television, surrounded by shattered glass. Small shards of glass and plastic debris are captured mid-air and scattered on the concrete ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good level of detail on the key objects, such as the swirled bowling ball and the specific brand of the CRT television. However, the description of the motion is confusing and chronologically backward. It describes the ball crashing through the screen first, only to reveal at the very end that the video is played in reverse. A more accurate and less disorienting description would follow the actual visual sequence, starting with the small shards of glass and plastic debris flying from the ground to magically reassemble the television screen. The caption should then describe the bowling ball emerging from the now-intact screen and rolling backward across the concrete. The phrase \"likely a driveway\" is speculative and should be stated definitively as \"a concrete driveway.\" The point of view is also missing; the video is filmed from a static, ground-level perspective, which emphasizes the impact and subsequent reverse motion. Lastly, the description of the motion as a \"speed ramp effect, transitioning from slow to even slower\" is unclear. It would be more precise to state that the reassembly and the ball's exit occur in consistent slow motion, which highlights the detail of the shattering glass reversing its trajectory.",
