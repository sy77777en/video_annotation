    "pre_caption": "In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, a small character with a carved orange head and a purple cloak walks across a grassy yard in a stylized, cartoonish setting. The yard contains a central stone well surrounded by a circular brick path, with a white picket fence, a tree stump, and a log in the background. In the foreground, a wooden dock extends over blue water next to the edge of a wooden building. A heads-up display is overlaid on the screen, featuring a coin icon with the number 22 in the bottom-left corner, an inventory bar at the bottom-center, and two vertical status bars in the bottom-right. The bottom of the view is also framed by a reddish-brown structural element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid overview of the scene's components but lacks specificity regarding the lighting, motion, and finer environmental details that would bring the video to life. While it correctly identifies the third-person perspective, it omits that the camera smoothly tracks the character from a slightly elevated angle, panning to follow their movement from the foreground dock towards the well in the midground. The description of the setting as \"cartoonish\" is accurate, but it fails to mention the bright, sunny daylight that casts soft, subtle shadows, indicating a midday setting. The \"carved orange head\" is more specifically a jack-o'-lantern with glowing yellow eyes and a stitched smile, and the \"blue water\" is not static but has gentle, animated ripples moving away from the dock. Furthermore, the caption misses small but important details like the colorful, low-poly flowers dotting the green grass and the mossy texture on the tree stump. The HUD description is functional but could be improved by noting that the inventory bar contains visible icons for a shovel and a watering can, and the vertical status bars are a full green bar and a nearly full red bar, suggesting they represent stamina and health.",
