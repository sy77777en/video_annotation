    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial perspective of a dense, green forest covering rolling hills. The camera slowly ascends, revealing a view of the blue ocean in the distance. A curved coastline with a beach separates the lush vegetation from the water. The scene takes place during the day under a clear blue sky with a few scattered white clouds.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview but lacks the specific sensory details present in the video. While it correctly identifies the \"dense, green forest,\" it fails to mention the varied textures and shades of green within the canopy, which suggest a mix of tropical foliage rather than a uniform woodland. The description of the \"beach\" is vague; the video clearly shows a crescent of fine, white sand bordered by dark, volcanic rock formations at one end. The \"blue ocean\" is more complex, with clear, shallow turquoise water near the coast that transitions to a deep sapphire further out, and the surface is textured with gentle, rolling waves. The time of day is described simply as \"day,\" but the low angle of the sun, the warm golden light bathing the landscape, and the long shadows cast by the hills strongly indicate it is late afternoon. Additionally, the camera movement is not just a slow ascent but also includes a subtle, simultaneous pan to the right, which gradually reveals the full expanse of the curved coastline.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A drone captures an aerial view of a vibrant, tropical forest blanketing rolling hills, showcasing a rich tapestry of textures and shades of green. As the camera ascends and subtly pans to the right, it unveils a breathtaking vista of the coastline, where a crescent of fine, white sand meets the ocean, bordered by striking dark volcanic rock formations. The ocean's hues transition from clear, shallow turquoise near the shore to a deep sapphire further out, its surface adorned with gentle, rolling waves. The scene is bathed in the warm, golden light of late afternoon, with the low sun casting long shadows across the landscape under a clear blue sky dotted with a few white clouds.",
