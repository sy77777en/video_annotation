    "pre_caption": "A third-person over-the-hip POV shot, framing a character from the hip up, follows him as he walks through a dark, outdoor setting. He moves along a narrow, unpaved path flanked by steep, moss-covered rock walls on one side and jagged rock formations on the other. The scene is set during dusk or an overcast day, with a misty quality in the distance. The surrounding forest consists of trees with sparse, reddish-brown autumn leaves. As the character advances, a dark, imposing gate made of stone and metal comes into view at the end of the path, with several indistinct figures standing atop it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person over-the-hip POV shot framing the character from the hip up.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the following imagined video content:\n*   **Video:** A smooth, third-person tracking shot, positioned low and slightly to the right of a character wearing a dark, hooded cloak. The camera follows them at a steady walking pace. The environment is a narrow, rocky chasm. The path is made of dark, damp soil and loose shale, with a few shallow puddles. The light is flat and grey, filtering down from a completely overcast sky, illuminating the heavy mist that hangs in the air. The rock walls are slick with moisture and covered in dark green moss. The trees clinging to the clifftops are skeletal, with only a few clinging, rust-colored leaves. The gate at the end is massive, with two thick stone pillars and a central section of black, wrought-iron bars covered in rust. Atop each pillar sits a heavily weathered stone carving of a wolf-like beast in a crouching position.\n\n***\n\nWhile the caption captures the general mood, it could be more precise. The term \"third-person over-the-hip POV shot\" is confusing; \"POV\" implies a first-person view, whereas the shot is a low-angle third-person perspective that tracks the character from behind. The caption's indecisiveness between \"dusk or an overcast day\" violates the instruction to avoid ambiguity; the flat, diffuse lighting and pervasive dampness strongly suggest an overcast day. The description of the path as simply \"unpaved\" misses key details like the damp earth and loose stones visible underfoot. Furthermore, the \"stone-shaped decorations\" on the gate are too vaguely described; they are clearly weathered stone carvings of crouching, beast-like figures. The \"metal\" of the gate could also be more specifically identified as rusted, wrought-iron bars, which adds to the sense of age and decay. Finally, the caption omits the steady, deliberate pace of the character's walk, which complements the smooth, uninterrupted camera movement as it follows them toward the gate.",
