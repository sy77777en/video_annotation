    "pre_caption": "A video filmed by a drone captures a vast, arid landscape during sunrise or sunset, with the low sun casting long shadows and a warm, golden light. The scene is dominated by a steep, barren hillside of brown earth in the foreground. In the distance, a wide expanse of rolling hills and valleys stretches to the horizon under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. A person wearing red pants and carrying a bicycle on their back is seen ascending the steep slope of the foreground hill. Sparse, low-lying green vegetation is visible in the lower elevations of the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A video filmed by a drone.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption captures the general essence of the scene, it lacks the specificity and dynamic detail present in the video. The use of \"sunrise or sunset\" is ambiguous; the video clearly depicts a sunrise, as the golden light gradually intensifies and spreads across the landscape. The caption also presents the scene as static, failing to describe the crucial motion of the drone, which performs a slow, ascending pull-back, starting with a medium shot of the person and gradually revealing the immense scale of the rolling hills behind them. The description of the terrain as \"barren hillside of brown earth\" is too general; the video shows a challenging surface of loose, reddish-brown scree and dusty soil, which explains the subject's slow, deliberate pace as they ascend. Furthermore, the caption omits that the bicycle is a full-suspension mountain bike strapped vertically to a large hiking pack, and it fails to mention the thin trail of dust kicked up by the person's feet, which is caught in the low-angle sunlight.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A drone video captures a breathtaking sunrise over a vast, arid landscape, with the golden light intensifying and spreading across the scene. The drone performs a slow, ascending pull-back, starting with a medium shot of a person wearing red pants, who is carefully ascending a steep slope. The person carries a full-suspension mountain bike strapped vertically to a large hiking pack. The challenging terrain consists of loose, reddish-brown scree and dusty soil, explaining their slow, deliberate pace. As they climb, a thin trail of dust is kicked up by their feet, caught in the low-angle sunlight.
