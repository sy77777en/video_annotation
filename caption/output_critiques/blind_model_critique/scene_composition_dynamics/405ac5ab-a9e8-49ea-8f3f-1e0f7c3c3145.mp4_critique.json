    "pre_caption": "From a third-person over-the-hip POV shot, the camera follows a person as they walk from a dark hallway into a brightly backlit room during the day. The destination room features a large window covered by sheer, vertical blinds, which casts the interior in silhouette. A dining table and chairs are visible against the bright, greenish-white light from the window. In the darker foreground, a shelving unit is positioned on the left wall. The scene has a grainy texture and is defined by the high contrast between the shadowed foreground and the illuminated background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person over-the-hip POV shot framing the character from the hip up.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "Your description captures the core action and high-contrast lighting of the scene, but it could be refined for greater accuracy and richness. The term \"third-person over-the-hip POV shot\" is contradictory; \"a low-angle, third-person follow shot\" would be a more precise description of the camera perspective. The camera's movement is described as simply moving forward, but the video shows a distinctly handheld, slightly unsteady motion that enhances the candid, intimate feel of following the children. While the caption mentions a \"shelving unit,\" it fails to note the discernible, albeit silhouetted, shapes of toys and books on its shelves, which add texture to the foreground. The description of the \"brightly backlit room\" is accurate but incomplete; it misses the prominent, soft blooming of the light around the edges of the vertical blinds and the children's figures, a key visual effect of the intense backlighting. Furthermore, the caption omits any mention of the audio, which consists of the clear, distinct patter of the children's bare feet on a hardwood floor and the faint, muffled ambient sounds of traffic from outside the window. Finally, the color description could be more specific; the \"dark hallway\" is not a neutral black but has a deep, cool-blue color cast that contrasts with the pale, greenish-white light from the window.",
