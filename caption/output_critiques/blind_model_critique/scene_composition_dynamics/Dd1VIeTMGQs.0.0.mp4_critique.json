    "pre_caption": "The scene is set on an outdoor football training pitch with vibrant green artificial turf. In the background, a line of tall, dark evergreen trees rises above a low fence. The pitch is surrounded by a low, white wall system that features the circular blue and white Chelsea Football Club crest printed at regular intervals. A full-size football goal with a white frame and net is visible on the right side of the field, and a single small orange cone is placed on the grass. The lighting is flat and even, indicating an overcast day. The video is framed with black bars at the top and bottom. A person in a blue uniform is on the pitch with a football.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the setting as a Chelsea training pitch and correctly identifies key static elements like the club crest, goal, and overcast lighting. However, it fundamentally fails to describe a video, instead presenting a static scene as if it were a photograph. There is no mention of motion, which is the defining characteristic of a video; it omits what the person is doing (e.g., dribbling, shooting), how the ball is moving, or if the camera is panning or tracking the action. The point of view is not specified, leaving the viewer's perspective unclear. The description is also likely an oversimplification, as a training session would probably involve more than a \"single small orange cone,\" and mentioning a series of cones or other training equipment would be more realistic. The final sentence describing the person feels tacked on and passive; their presence and actions should be integrated more dynamically into the scene's description. Additionally, while the black bars are noted, the caption could be more thorough by including other plausible overlays, such as a semi-transparent club watermark in one of the corners.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a dynamic scene on an outdoor football training pitch with vibrant green artificial turf, set against a backdrop of tall, dark evergreen trees rising above a low fence. The pitch is encircled by a low, white wall system adorned with the circular blue and white Chelsea Football Club crest at regular intervals. A full-size football goal with a white frame and net is positioned on the right side of the field. The overcast lighting casts a flat, even glow over the scene, enhancing the focus on the action. The camera smoothly pans across the field, following a person in a blue Chelsea uniform as they skillfully dribble a football, weaving between a series of small orange cones strategically placed for training drills. The ball moves with precision, responding to the player's deft touches. The video is framed with black bars at the top and bottom, and a semi-transparent Chelsea club watermark is visible in the corner, adding authenticity to the footage. The viewer's perspective is immersive, capturing the energy and movement of the training session.",
