    "pre_caption": "A third-person over-the-hip POV shot framing the character from the hip up follows a man in a brown leather jacket as he moves through a gloomy, fog-filled rural village at night. The scene is set outdoors on muddy, uneven ground between old, dilapidated houses constructed from rough, uneven stone with tiled and corrugated metal roofs. A large, raging bonfire in the center of the village serves as the primary light source, illuminating the dark surroundings and revealing a figure tied to a post within the flames. The area is cluttered with barrels, crates, and loose wooden planks. The perspective shifts as the character draws a handgun and advances from behind a stone trough toward the fire, where other figures, some armed with axes, are moving about.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A third-person over-the-hip POV shot framing the character from the hip up.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively establishes a tense, horror-like atmosphere, but it could be improved with more specific sensory details and refined terminology. The description \"third-person over-the-hip POV shot\" is slightly redundant; a more standard and concise term like \"an over-the-shoulder perspective\" would be clearer. While the bonfire is correctly identified as the primary light source, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the quality of its light—the flickering, warm orange glow that casts long, dancing shadows and illuminates the swirling fog and rising smoke. The \"muddy, uneven ground\" could be more detailed; for instance, it might be wet cobblestone slick with mud, reflecting the firelight. The description of the other figures is too generic; specifying that they are villagers in tattered, rustic clothing moving with erratic, shambling gaits would better convey the threat. Furthermore, the \"perspective shift\" as the character draws his weapon could be more precisely described as the camera tightening over his shoulder as he takes aim. Finally, while the bonfire is described as \"raging,\" the caption omits the visual consequences, such as the shower of embers carried into the night sky by the wind.",
