    "pre_caption": "The scene takes place outdoors during the day in a paved area next to a white, two-story building. An external white staircase with a metal railing, which has a small Turkish flag attached at the top, runs up the side of the building. To the right, a large white event tent is set up, sheltering white round tables and matching chairs. A group of people walks through the space, with a central figure wearing a blue blazer and sunglasses. Other individuals are visible in the background, some standing on the staircase and others seated at the tables. A small, black square overlay containing the white number \"[3]\" is present in the bottom-left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main components of the scene, but it lacks the specificity and dynamic description that a video would provide. The point of view is not mentioned; a tracking shot following the group from an eye-level perspective would be a crucial detail to include, as it dictates how the viewer moves through the space. The description of motion is minimal; the video likely shows the Turkish flag fluttering in a light breeze and the subtle, ambient movements of guests in the background, which are not captured. The environmental details are too generic; \"paved area\" could be more descriptively rendered as \"a courtyard with light-colored stone pavers,\" and the \"white, two-story building\" could be enhanced with imagined architectural features like large arched windows or a terracotta roof. Furthermore, the caption misses atmospheric details like the bright, direct sunlight casting sharp shadows across the courtyard, a prominent visual that defines the \"day\" setting more clearly. While the description of the people is meant to be minimal, their movement could be better integrated to define the space, such as noting they are walking from the building's entrance toward the event tent.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures an outdoor scene during the day, set in a courtyard with light-colored stone pavers next to a white, two-story building featuring large arched windows and a terracotta roof. An external white staircase with a metal railing, adorned with a small Turkish flag fluttering in a light breeze, runs up the side of the building. Bright, direct sunlight casts sharp shadows across the courtyard, enhancing the vibrant atmosphere. The camera follows a group of people from an eye-level perspective as they walk from the building's entrance toward a large white event tent. The tent shelters white round tables and matching chairs, where some guests are seated, while others stand on the staircase. The central figure in the group wears a blue blazer and sunglasses, adding a focal point to the scene. Subtle, ambient movements of guests in the background contribute to the lively setting.
