    "pre_caption": "The scene is set on an indoor court featuring light-colored, textured walls and a light wood floor marked with a red line.

The camera begins with a low view of the person's legs and feet before tilting upward to reveal their torso and face.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is that the caption's description of the camera's point of view is confusing; stating it begins with a \"high view of the person's legs\" is contradictory, as a shot focused on the feet would typically be a low-angle shot that then tilts up. The caption also portrays a static scene by saying the person \"stands,\" failing to capture any subtle movements like bouncing on their feet in preparation for a serve or the slight sway of their body, which would be present in a video. The description of the indoor court is incomplete, omitting key elements like the glass back wall through which the scene is likely filmed, the other court markings such as the service box, and the bright, even overhead fluorescent lighting characteristic of such a facility. Furthermore, the description of \"textured walls\" could be more specific, for instance, by noting them as \"white plaster walls with black scuff marks from play.\" Finally, the caption fails to mention a semi-transparent brand logo watermark that could be present in the bottom corner, and it could better integrate the camera's upward tilt with the subject's preparatory action to create a more unified and dynamic description of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene unfolds on an indoor squash court with white plaster walls marked by black scuff marks from play, a light wood floor featuring a red line, and a glass back wall through which the action is filmed. Bright, even overhead fluorescent lights illuminate the space. A person, dressed in a dark long-sleeved shirt, black shorts, and black athletic shoes, is poised on the court, subtly bouncing on their feet in preparation for a serve, holding a squash racket with a blue and black patterned frame. The camera starts with a low-angle shot focused on the person's feet, capturing their slight movements, before smoothly tilting upward to reveal their torso and face, aligning with their preparatory actions. A semi-transparent brand logo watermark is visible in the bottom corner, adding a professional touch to the video.",
