    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The provided description accurately details the static, white-on-black overlay screen that likely serves as a title or end card, but it critically fails to describe the primary visual content of the video itself. The caption omits any mention of the central scene, which is a time-lapse of a massive supercell thunderstorm forming over a vast, open plain at dusk. It neglects to describe the key natural features, such as the detailed, rotating cloud structure and the flat landscape, or the dramatic motion of the clouds swirling and evolving. Furthermore, the description does not account for the scene transition, failing to explain that the video hard cuts from the initial overlay screen to the outdoor storm scene. To align with the instructions, the caption should integrate a description of this main segment, including the outdoor setting, the time of day, the weather phenomena like lightning, and the time-lapse motion, while also noting the structural cuts between the overlay and the main footage.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a static shot featuring a solid black background, where a white overlay displays a stylized monogram logo, resembling an intertwined 'M' and 'O' with a hand-drawn, textured look. Below, white text provides information: \"CLIPS AVAILABLE UP TO 8K RESOLUTION // COPYRIGHT © 2017 MIKE OLBINSKI PHOTOGRAPHY,\" and \"CONTACT INFORMATION: MikeOlbinski.com // MUSIC: PeterNanasi.com.\" The scene then transitions with a hard cut to a breathtaking time-lapse of a massive supercell thunderstorm forming over a vast, open plain at dusk. The video captures the dramatic motion of swirling clouds, showcasing the detailed, rotating cloud structure against the flat landscape. Lightning occasionally illuminates the scene, adding to the awe-inspiring display of nature's power. The time-lapse emphasizes the dynamic evolution of the storm, providing a captivating visual experience.",
