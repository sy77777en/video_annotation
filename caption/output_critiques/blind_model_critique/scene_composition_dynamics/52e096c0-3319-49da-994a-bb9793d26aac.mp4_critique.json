    "pre_caption": "The scene is set outdoors at night on what appears to be a high-rise balcony or rooftop, with a sprawling cityscape of illuminated skyscrapers filling the background. The numerous building windows glow with yellow and white light, creating a blurred, grid-like pattern against the dark sky. In the foreground, a person wearing glasses, a white top, a black skirt, and black stockings stands near a window frame or railing. The video is presented in a widescreen format with a black letterbox bar at the bottom.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption successfully establishes the core setting and time of day, but it lacks several key details required by the instructions and misallocates focus. It completely omits the point of view, which could be described as a static, eye-level shot from within the room, creating an observational feel. The description of the person's clothing is excessively detailed, violating the guideline to focus on scenery over subjects; a more appropriate description would be \"a person stands in silhouette\" or \"a person is seen from behind,\" which complements the scene without drawing too much attention. Furthermore, the caption fails to describe any features of the immediate interior, such as the reflection of a dimly lit lamp on the glass or the polished floor catching the city lights, which would better establish the indoor environment. The description also portrays a static scene, missing the opportunity to mention subtle motion like the faint, distant movement of traffic or a slow pan of the camera across the cityscape, which would confirm it is a video. Finally, describing the window as \"floor-to-ceiling\" would be more specific and evocative for a high-rise setting than the generic \"glass window.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene unfolds at night from a static, eye-level perspective within a high-rise room, offering an observational view of the sprawling cityscape of illuminated skyscrapers. The floor-to-ceiling window frames the city lights, which create a blurred, grid-like pattern against the dark sky. A person stands in silhouette near the window, adding depth to the scene without drawing focus. Inside, the reflection of a dimly lit lamp shimmers on the glass, and the polished floor subtly catches the city lights. The faint, distant movement of traffic and a slow pan across the cityscape confirm the dynamic nature of the video.",
