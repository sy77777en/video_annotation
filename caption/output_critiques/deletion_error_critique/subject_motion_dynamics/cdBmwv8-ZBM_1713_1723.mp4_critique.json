    "pre_caption": "The man in the leather jacket raises a handgun and shoots another man, who then falls to his knees. The man in the jacket walks forward and kicks the fallen man. As he continues toward a large bonfire, several other men begin to converge on his position from the surrounding area. The man in the jacket then turns and runs in a circular path around the bonfire to evade the approaching men.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject is a man with short, blond hair, seen primarily from an over-the-hip perspective. He is wearing a brown leather jacket with a light-colored shearling collar over a dark shirt and dark pants. He is initially seen standing before raising a silver handgun to aim. As he moves forward, several other men appear. One man, wearing a cap, a light-colored long-sleeved shirt, and dark pants, initially stands with his back to the main character, is then shot, falls to the ground, and is kicked once by the main character. Another man with a beard, wearing a reddish vest over a shirt, stands near a large bonfire holding an axe. A third man with a dark beard and dark, simple clothing approaches the main character from near the fire. Other men in similar rustic clothing are visible in the scene, standing at a distance, while another figure is being burned on the bonfire. The camera intermittently transitions to an over-the-shoulder view for aiming but predominantly maintains an over-the-hip point of view.**",
