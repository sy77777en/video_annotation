    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle close-up shot of a granular surface that fills the bottom of the frame, with a shallow depth of field blurring the immediate foreground and background. A pair of human hands enters the frame from the top, moving down into the central middle ground to dig into the surface. The shot composition shifts to a close-up of the hands as they unearth a model boat, which is revealed in the center of the frame, also in the middle ground. The hands then lift the boat slightly upward within the central area of the shot. Throughout the scene, swirling fog drifts across the middle ground, partially obscuring the action. The camera remains static and positioned at the same height as the hands and the uncovered object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black-and-white, close-up shot, a pair of pale human hands appears over a misty, granular surface. The hands take up a small, dark object from a lower surface of the ground. This object is revealed to be a model boat, caked in dirt and soil, with a distinct hull and a short, thin piece resembling a mast protruding from its deck. The hands gently lift the excavated boat.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a close-up, monochromatic scene, a granular, soil-like surface is partially obscured by swirling fog or dust. Two hands emerge through the murky atmosphere and carefully retrieve a dark, irregularly shaped object from the ground, caked with the same soil and small particles. The hands manipulate the object as the dense, white fog continues to billow, intermittently hiding the details of the discovery.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: Initially showing a shallow view of the ground, the camera stays fixed as a pair of human hands are introduced, digging a model boat out of the earth. The shot size changes from a close-up shot of the ground to a close-up shot of human hands and the model boat.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the hands appear, the camera is at the same height as the hands, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
