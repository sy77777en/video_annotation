    "pre_caption": "A full shot frames a snowboarder in the foreground, who remains consistently in the center of the frame throughout the clip. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, capturing their movement down a snowy slope. In the middle ground, other skiers are visible in the top left and center, with trees lining the top left and top right edges of the frame and a safety net running along the middle right. A ski lift structure is situated in the background on the top right. As the central snowboarder moves forward, the background and middle ground elements appear to recede and move past them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person is snowboarding down a snowy slope, filmed from a selfie perspective using a selfie stick held in their left hand. This individual wears a black helmet with a blue pattern, and a hooded jacket that is black on the torso and hood with white sleeves; a small blue logo is visible on the left sleeve. They are also wearing black pants and black gloves. In the background, other people can be seen further down the slope, appearing as small figures dressed in dark winter clothing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed, captures a snowboarder moving down a wide, snow-covered slope at a ski resort. The sky is overcast, and the landscape is dotted with bare trees along the edges of the run. In the background, a ski lift structure and its towers are visible ascending the mountain, and a few other skiers can be seen in the distance. A blue and white safety net lines one side of the slope as the snowboarder carves through the snow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
