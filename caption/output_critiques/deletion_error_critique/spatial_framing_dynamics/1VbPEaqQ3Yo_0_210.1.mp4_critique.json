    "pre_caption": "The scene is presented as a static full shot, framed by dark, out-of-focus structures in the immediate foreground on the left and right, creating the impression of viewing the scene from an entryway. In the center of the frame and occupying the middle ground, a large, skeletal, winged creature hovers directly above a massive pile of bones resting on a raised platform. Several small, glowing humanoid figures are also positioned in the middle ground, flanking the central bone pile on the left and right sides of the platform. Further in the background, tall, dark monoliths stand behind the central subjects. The camera is positioned at the level of the subjects on the platform, and the spatial composition remains unchanged.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark, cavernous space, a large, skeletal, griffin-like creature with massive, outspread wings hovers centrally. The creature, rendered in dark grey and black tones, has the skeletal body of a quadruped, the skull of a bird of prey with a hooked beak, and large, feathered wings. It appears to be holding a long, ornate staff or weapon. Directly beneath it, resting on a raised platform, is the massive, fragmented skull and upper torso of another skeletal being, from which dark, wispy smoke emanates. Flanking this central arrangement on the platform are several small, glowing, white, humanoid figures standing erect like sentinels.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a vast and dark hall, viewed as if from an entryway. In the center of the cavernous space, a massive, dark, skeletal creature with large, outstretched wings is suspended in the air. This winged figure holds a long staff and hovers over a large, intricate pile of what appears to be bones. The entire central structure is shrouded in a dark, swirling mist. In the background, tall, dark, rectangular monoliths stand in the gloom. The only sources of light are a few small, glowing white objects placed on the dark, patterned floor. The overall scene is monochromatic, rendered almost entirely in shades of black and dark grey.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
