    "pre_caption": "In this full shot, a child on a pedal car is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, riding away from the camera down a long hallway. The camera, positioned at the child's level, tracks from behind, maintaining the child's central position as they move forward. The child begins on a patterned carpet in the middle ground and then transitions onto a polished wooden floor further into the scene. As the camera and child advance, the hallway walls, doors, and potted plants on the left and right sides of the frame move from the middle ground toward the foreground and past the edges of the shot, while the far end of the hallway remains in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young child with shoulder-length, light brown hair is seen from behind, riding a pedal car. The child wears a red long-sleeved shirt under blue overalls. They are seated on the blue seat of the red-framed pedal car, holding the handlebars and actively pedaling with their feet, which are clad in red sneakers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A child on a blue and red ride-on toy travels down a long, wide hotel hallway. The camera follows from behind as the child moves across two different floor surfaces: a highly polished, dark wood floor and a carpet with a large, repeating geometric pattern of interconnected hexagons in orange, red, and brown. The hallway's light-colored walls are punctuated by dark wooden doors with partial red patches and feature wall-mounted sconces. In the background and along the sides, there are potted plants, framed pictures, and a dark armchair placed against the wall on the right side of the frame. A staircase is visible in the background. The hallway is illuminated by warm, artificial light from both the sconces and overhead fixtures.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
