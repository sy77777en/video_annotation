    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a central figure in a blue shirt is positioned in the middle ground at the center of the frame. This figure is surrounded by a crowd of white, low-polygon figures that create depth in the scene. One of these white figures is partially visible in the left foreground, while another stands in the right middle ground beside the central figure. Several other white figures are arranged behind them, extending from the middle ground into the background. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level, looking directly at the crowd against a muted, undefined background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A faceless human-like figure with short, dark, curly hair and a light blue t-shirt stands among a group. This figure is surrounded by a crowd of other faceless, human-like figures rendered in a monochrome white, low-polygon style, giving them a geometric and faceted appearance. Some of these surrounding geometric figures appear to be wearing collared shirts and are positioned behind and to the sides of the figure in the blue shirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an undefined setting with a muted blue-gray background, a faceless figure with dark hair and a light blue t-shirt is positioned in a crowd. This prominent figure is surrounded by numerous other faceless figures, all rendered in a solid white, low-polygon style with geometric, chiseled surfaces. Some of the surrounding figures appear to be wearing collared shirts, while others are wearing t-shirts or hoodies. An overlay of yellow text is visible and changes at the bottom of the screen, displaying subtitles that include the words \"marching, speed marching, pace,\" \"around the schoolyard,\" and \"which is kind of like a prison.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
