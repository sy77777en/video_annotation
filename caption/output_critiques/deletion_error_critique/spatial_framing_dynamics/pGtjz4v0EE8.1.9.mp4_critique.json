    "pre_caption": "This full shot begins with a male statue in the left foreground and a female warrior statue in the center-right middle ground, set within a niche. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, pans right in a counterclockwise arc. As it moves, the male statue exits the left of the frame, and the central warrior statue shifts to the left side of the frame. This movement reveals a third statue of a robed female, which enters from the right and becomes prominent in the right middle ground. Throughout the pan, the background columns and vaulted ceiling of the corridor move laterally across the frame, accentuating the scene's depth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a series of classical-style stone statues displayed in an indoor gallery corridor. The camera focuses on a central grouping of three sculptures: a prominent female warrior statue set within a niche in the middle of the corridor, flanked by two smaller statues positioned against the wall. The first statue is a male figure, nude from the waist up, with short, curly hair, standing slightly ahead of the female warrior statue. This central statue depicts a woman wearing a crested helmet and draped garments, holding a round shield in her left hand. As the camera continues along the corridor, a third female statue is revealed. She is dressed in flowing robes, with part of her hair covered by a veil, and holds a small object raised in her right hand. All the statues are a uniform, light-yellowish color, consistent with marble under warm lighting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An arcing movement reveals a long, indoor gallery with classical architecture. The corridor features walls made of large, light-colored stone blocks, prominent columns with ornate capitals, and an arched, vaulted ceiling. Lining both sides of the corridor are life-sized stone statues, including a central alcove on one side where a larger statue of a female warrior wearing a helmet and holding a shield stands, flanked by other statues. The entire scene is bathed in a warm, golden light that gives the stone a yellowish hue. Occasionally, visitors can be seen walking through the space along the lower edge of the frame.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot begins in a full view of the statue (though its feet are cropped out), showing the figure framed within its niche. As the camera moves closer, the framing shifts into a medium shot, focusing on the statue’s upper body, drapery, and facial details. Finally, the camera moves back out to restore the full shot, once again presenting the statue in its architectural setting.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
