    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, static shot of a nighttime cityscape scenery. A large tower is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground, with purple electrical arcs discharging from its top. The bottom of the frame is filled with the silhouettes of a crowd, which extends from the foreground into the middle ground. Silhouetted trees are visible in the middle ground on both the left and right sides of the frame. In the background, a lit building is positioned to the left of the tower, and several streetlights are scattered across the scene, adding depth. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up toward the tower. The framing remains constant throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot at night, capturing a spectacular electrical display from a massive, tower-like structure. The dark, cylindrical tower is topped with a large, flat ring from which vibrant, purple arcs of electricity, resembling bolts of lightning, erupt and dance against the dark sky. In the background, the warm glow of streetlights and the illuminated windows of a distant building punctuate the darkness. The silhouettes of trees extend from the midground to the background, while the crowd of onlookers spans from the foreground to the midground, both effectively framing the scene. Additionally, trees illuminated by the streetlights add depth to the background. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the public spectacle. The combination of the powerful electrical discharge and the urban setting creates a dynamic environmental scene rather than focusing on a specific entity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a large, dark, mushroom-shaped tower stands in an open area. Bright purple electrical arcs, resembling lightning, are continuously discharged from the circular top of the tower, branching out against the dark sky. In the background, the lights of a city building and several streetlights are visible beyond silhouetted trees. A crowd of people extends from the foreground to the midground, adding depth to the scene as they observe the tower.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
