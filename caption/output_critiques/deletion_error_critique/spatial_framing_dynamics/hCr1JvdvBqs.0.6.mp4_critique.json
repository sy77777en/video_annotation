    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. On the far left, the back of another person's head is visible in the foreground. A window is located in the background to the left of the man. The camera remains static at the subjects' eye level throughout the clip. The man slightly lifts his head from a downward-looking position to face forward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned, middle-aged man with shoulder-length, wavy dark brown hair, a dark brown mustache, and a goatee is shown in a close-up. He is wearing a dark brown jacket over a dark collared shirt. He is seated and facing slightly to his left, looking at another person who is mostly off-screen. Initially, he has a neutral expression and looks slightly downward, then he looks up and opens his mouth as if to speak. To the left, the back of another person's head and shoulder are visible; this person has light brown hair.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene takes place during the day, likely on a moving train. A man with long, dark hair and a beard sits in a dark, high-backed seat. To his left, a window reveals a blurred view of a green, rolling landscape passing by. The interior is softly lit, and the scene is framed by black bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
