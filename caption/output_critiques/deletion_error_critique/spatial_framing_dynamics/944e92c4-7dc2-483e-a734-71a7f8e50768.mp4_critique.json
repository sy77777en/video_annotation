    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of scenery captured from a low-angle, worm's-eye view looking upward. The background is composed of a blue sky with clouds, occupying the top left and central areas of the frame. In the foreground, two parallel concrete beams slice diagonally across the scene, originating from the bottom of the frame and extending towards the top right. The lower beam is positioned in the bottom left and center, while the upper, more distant beam is positioned from the center towards the top right. Throughout the shot, a slow and subtle camera movement to the right causes the foreground beams to drift slightly toward the left side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot featuring a worm's-eye view of a deep blue sky filled with scattered white clouds. Cutting diagonally across the frame are two parallel concrete beams, part of an unseen structure like a bridge or overpass, detailed with small metal fixtures and a glass railing along their upper edge. There is no main subject in the video. The focus is instead on the environmental contrast between the rigid, man-made lines of the architecture and the soft, organic texture of the sky, creating an atmospheric and contemplative mood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a worm's-eye view looking directly upward, the scene is dominated by a deep blue sky with fluffy white clouds that appear to drift due to camera movement. Two large, parallel concrete beams of an elevated structure initially extend diagonally from the bottom middle of the frame to the upper right corner. As the camera rolls counterclockwise, their orientation shifts to extend from the bottom left to the top right. The weathered, beige-colored beams feature small metal fixtures attached to their sides. The composition has a grainy, film-like texture and is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
