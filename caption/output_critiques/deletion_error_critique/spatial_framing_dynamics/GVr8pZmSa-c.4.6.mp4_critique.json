    "pre_caption": "The video presents a high-angle full shot of a black binder resting on a wooden table. The binder is positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground, while the table surface extends from the foreground to the middle ground, occupying the majority of the frame. The background remains out of focus. The camera maintains a fixed position, and there is no movement from the subjects. In the bottom left foreground, a numerical overlay is consistently visible, while a second overlay gradually appears in the same location.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black, rectangular binder lies flat on a light brown wooden surface. The spine of the binder, which is facing forward, features a white label divided into several sections by vertical grey lines. To the left of the label, there is a circular finger hole with a metallic, copper-colored rim.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting, a black rectangular binder rests on a light brown, wood-grain table. The binder is positioned horizontally, and its spine features a round, metallic-rimmed finger hole and a white label with several vertical gray stripes. The background is out of focus. In the bottom left corner, there are two overlays: a \"[2]\" that remains visible throughout the video, and a white \"2005\" inside a deep blue rectangular box that gradually appears later in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
