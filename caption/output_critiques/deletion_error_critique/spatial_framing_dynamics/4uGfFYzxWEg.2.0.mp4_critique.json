    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a shot framed from over the shoulder of two humanoid figures. The back of one figure's head is in the bottom-left foreground, while the upper body of the second figure occupies the bottom-right foreground. In the background, a bank of television monitors is arranged across the frame, with a keyboard resting in the bottom-center middle ground. The camera, positioned above the foreground figures and level with the monitors, slowly pushes forward. As the camera advances, the two foreground figures are gradually cropped out, exiting from the left and right sides of the frame. This movement transitions the focus to the monitors, bringing the central screen, which initially sits in the middle ground, into a more prominent full shot that dominates the center of the frame, while the surrounding screens remain partially visible at the edges.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two white, featureless humanoid figures in the foreground, positioned as if they are watching a bank of television monitors. The figure on the left is seen from the back of the head and shoulders, while the one on the right is holding something resembling a telephone to its ear with its left hand. The monitors in the background all display scenes from the game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\". The central screen, which is the main focus, shows a medium close-up of a fair-skinned male contestant with short brown hair and a receding hairline. He wears a light blue polo shirt with a dark collar, one pink sleeve, and one white sleeve, and is seen smiling thoughtfully. Other screens show different angles of the same contestant, as well as an older, fair-skinned male host with light-colored hair, dressed in a suit and tie. As the camera moves closer to the screens, the foreground figures gradually move out of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark room, a bank of CRT monitors sits on a wooden desk, each displaying a different moment from the game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\". The central monitor shows a male contestant considering the question, \"The Normans, who invaded and conquered England in 1066, spoke which language?\". Other screens show the host, different questions, and various reactions from the contestant. In front of the monitors, a beige computer keyboard rests on the desk. The backs of two white, featureless, mannequin-like figures are in the foreground, appearing to watch the screens. An overlay in the bottom-left corner initially reads, \"[4] : ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2001)\", but midway through the video, it changes to \"ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2001)\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with two humanoid subjects, one showing only the head on the left and the other a partly visible upper body on the right, against a background of multiple broadcast screens. As the camera moves forward, the subjects gradually move out of frame, ending on a full shot of one screen with parts of others still visible, showing a person in a medium close-up.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is above the humanoid subject, at the same height as some of the screens.",
