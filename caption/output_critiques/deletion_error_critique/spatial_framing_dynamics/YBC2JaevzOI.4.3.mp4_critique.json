    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a dark outdoor scene, framed by a dark, undefined structure in the foreground at the bottom and right. A silhouetted staircase occupies the middle ground, positioned from the center to the left of the frame. Through the staircase, an illuminated porch is visible in the background, extending from the center to the right. A silhouetted figure, establishing a full shot, is then revealed at the top of the stairs in the upper center of the frame and proceeds to walk down toward the lower center. The figure remains in the middle ground and is silhouetted against the background light throughout its descent. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark, nighttime scene, the video reveals a silhouetted figure descending an outdoor staircase. Initially, only the dark structure of the stairs and a lit porch area are visible. A person, completely in silhouette and appearing to wear dark, long-sleeved clothing and pants, emerges from the top of the stairs and walks down. Their form is outlined against the light from the porch below as they move down the dark metal staircase.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, an outdoor view shows a building with an illuminated porch area on the first floor. The scene is predominantly dark, with a dark metal staircase silhouetted against the lit area. The staircase, featuring vertical railings, leads down to the porch, which has a light-colored ceiling fitted with white, circular lights. A silhouetted figure walks down the stairs toward the lit area.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
