    "pre_caption": "In a static, high-angle full shot, a man in a trench coat is positioned in the center of the frame, walking in the middle ground away from the camera and toward the top of the frame. As he walks, a second man enters from the top right and moves diagonally toward the bottom left, also in the middle ground, passing the first man. The head and shoulders of another person are visible in the bottom right foreground. Long, dark shadows of the pedestrians are cast across the pavement from right to left. The camera remains positioned above the subjects throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Viewed from a high angle, the main subject is a man with short, dark brown hair walking away from the camera on a paved sidewalk. He wears a light gray, knee-length trench coat over brown trousers and carries a small, light-colored, rectangular object in his right hand. As he proceeds, another man with short, dark, thinning hair walks toward him. This second man is dressed in a dark gray jacket over a black turtleneck and light-colored trousers, with his hands in his pockets. Other pedestrians are partially visible at the periphery, including the head and shoulders of a person with dark hair at the bottom of the view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, overhead-level perspective, a paved city sidewalk is seen on a sunny day. The sidewalk consists of large, light gray rectangular tiles, marked by a single white painted line. The bright sunlight casts long, dark shadows of pedestrians as they walk. One man in a gray trench coat moves across the pavement, while another man in a dark jacket walks nearby.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
