    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground, with a hallway visible in the background. The red text \"GIMBAL\" is overlaid in the top left of the frame, and she holds a small axe in the bottom left. The camera is positioned at her level. Throughout the shot, she moves forward toward the camera, causing the framing to tighten as she occupies more of the central frame and moves closer from the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black woman with long, bright red hair and red-colored eyes is shown from the chest up. She is wearing a red, low-cut top and a thin necklace with a small, four-leaf clover pendant. In her right hand, she holds a small, black axe. Her facial expression is intense, with her mouth open in a wide, toothy smile or grimace. The word \"GIMBAL\" is displayed as an overlay in red, sans-serif text in the upper portion of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a brightly lit indoor hallway with white walls and a white ceiling featuring rectangular light fixtures. A person with long, bright red hair and a red top moves forward through the space, holding a small black axe. The scene is framed with a dark vignette. In the upper left area, the word \"GIMBAL\" is displayed as a red text overlay.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
