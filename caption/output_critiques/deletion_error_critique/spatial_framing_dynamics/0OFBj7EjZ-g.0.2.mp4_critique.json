    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of an architectural model from a high-angle, aerial perspective. In the foreground, a collection of stylized, low-poly white trees occupies the bottom of the frame. The middle ground is dominated by a detailed building complex located in the center of the frame. This central complex is surrounded by a simplified, all-white model of a cityscape that extends to the left, right, and top of the frame, occupying both the middle ground and background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an architectural model scenery shot, offering an aerial perspective of a modern building complex. The two main structures are multi-story, with light-colored facades, numerous windows, and intricate glass-and-steel roofs, connected by a central, arched canopy. These detailed buildings stand in stark contrast to the surrounding environment, which is rendered as a simplified, all-white, blocky cityscape with stylized, low-poly trees in the foreground. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is placed on the architectural design and the scale of the development as a whole, emphasizing the environment and overall aesthetic rather than any single element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a high-angle view of a digital architectural rendering of a city block during the daytime. The scene centers on two large, multi-story buildings with light-colored facades and numerous windows, connected by an arched steel canopy. Both buildings are topped with modern, grid-patterned roofs. These detailed structures are set within a simplified, monochromatic white model of a city, where surrounding buildings are represented as untextured blocks. In the foreground, a cluster of abstract, low-poly white shapes resembles a stylized forest. A street with a few vehicles runs in front and along the sides of the main complex, with one branch of the road extending between them.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
