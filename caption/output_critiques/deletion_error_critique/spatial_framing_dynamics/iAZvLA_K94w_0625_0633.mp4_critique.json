    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle wide shot of a debris-covered paved area that fills the middle ground and background. The camera then tilts down, revealing an overturned car that enters from the bottom of the frame. The car settles in the foreground, occupying the lower half of the shot, establishing a full shot of the subject. The debris-strewn ground remains visible in the middle ground and background. Throughout the shot, the camera stays in a high-angle position, looking down on the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black and white, high-angle shot, a paved ground is shown littered with light-colored rubble and numerous dark, crumpled objects. As the camera tilts down, it reveals a small, light-colored car in the foreground. The car is completely overturned, with its roof oriented to the left of the frame and the undercarriage to the right. The dark interior seats are visible through the open window frames of the vehicle, which is surrounded by the same debris seen across the rest of the area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a high-angle, black-and-white shot, the camera looks down upon a paved outdoor area littered with debris. The ground is covered with scattered papers and dark, crumpled objects. As the camera slowly tilts downward, a white car, overturned on its side, comes into view in the foreground. An overlay in the bottom-left corner consists of a black transparent box featuring a yellow logo and white text that reads \"Degrees of Movement,\" which gradually fades out towards the end of the scene. Another overlay in the bottom-right corner reads \"THE SACRIFICE (1986)\" in white text.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
