    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle full shot of a black convertible, which is positioned diagonally across the frame from the bottom left to the top right against a solid gray background. The camera then slowly pushes in towards the vehicle while simultaneously rotating clockwise and tilting downward. This movement transitions the perspective from a high-angle side view to a direct bird's-eye view. The final framing is a medium shot that centers on the car's interior, showing the silver roll bar at the bottom of the frame, the two middle jump seats in the center, and the rear bench seat at the top. The camera remains positioned above the car throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black, vintage-style convertible limousine is presented from a high angle. The car has a long, sleek body with chrome trim along its top edge and a silver-colored roll bar positioned over the middle section. The interior, which is the primary focus, is upholstered in a vibrant blue and features three rows of seating. This arrangement includes a front bench seat, two smaller individual jump seats in the middle, and a larger bench seat in the rear. The view transitions from a side profile to a closer, top-down perspective that emphasizes the unique seating configuration.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A high-angle shot showcases a vintage black convertible limousine against a solid dark gray background. The vehicle's interior is lined with bright blue upholstery and features three rows of seats: a front bench, two forward-facing jump seats in the middle, and a larger bench seat in the back. Chrome accents trim the top of the car, the windshield, and a central roll bar that separates the front and middle seating areas. As the camera moves forward while simultaneously rolling clockwise and tilting downward, it focuses on the unique configuration of the middle and rear seats. A small step is visible on the side of the car, and four thin antennas extend from the rear.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a black convertible, starting with a full shot from a high angle, showing the car’s side and its blue seats. The camera then slowly moves closer, shifting to a bird’s eye view that highlights part of the blue seats inside.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
