    "pre_caption": "A full shot frames a male lion lying in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a dark, paved surface that extends horizontally across the scene. Green grass occupies the bottom of the frame in the foreground, while a dense line of green trees fills the background. The camera is positioned at the lion's level. Throughout the static shot, the lion remains lying down but repeatedly tilts its head slightly upward and to the right as it vocalizes.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large male lion with tan fur and a thick, dark brown and black mane is lying down on a paved surface. The lion is seen in profile, facing towards the right. It is actively vocalizing, with its mouth open in a roar, revealing its teeth and tongue as it tilts its head slightly upward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a natural, outdoor setting, a dark, paved road runs horizontally across the scene, flanked by green grass in the foreground. A dense thicket of green trees and bushes forms the background under a bright, overcast sky. A large male lion with a prominent dark mane is lying down on the road, positioned facing forward towards the right side of the frame. The lion repeatedly lifts its head and opens its mouth in a vocalization.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
