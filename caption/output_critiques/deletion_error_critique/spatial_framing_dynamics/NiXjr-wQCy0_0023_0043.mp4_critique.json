    "pre_caption": "The shot opens on a concrete surface occupying the foreground and middle ground, set against a blurred green background and framed by vertical blurred bars on the left and right. Initially, water droplets and glass fragments materialize in the air in the center of the middle ground. These elements move inward, converging to form a large splash. As this splash rapidly contracts, the scene becomes a full shot, revealing a pink, polka-dotted balloon forming in the center middle ground as the water recedes into it. The metal base of a light bulb is revealed at the front of the balloon, while the glass fragments from the splash fly forward, coming to rest in the foreground. The camera remains stationary and positioned at the subject's level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a reverse-motion sequence, this video reveals the original state of an object after it has burst. The scene begins with a spray of water droplets and what appear to be glass fragments suspended in the air over a concrete surface. These elements rapidly fly inward, coalescing into a large, shimmering splash that quickly contracts. As the water retracts, it forms a pink, partially inflated balloon with white polka dots. This action simultaneously reveals that a silver, metal screw base from a light bulb, with its filament structure intact, was inserted into the balloon's opening. The video concludes as the fully reformed light bulb ascends into the sky, completing the mesmerizing transformation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a daytime outdoor setting, a reverse-motion sequence unfolds on a rough, light-brown concrete surface with a blurred green background. A pink balloon with white polka dots, initially punctured by broken glass pieces, reassembles as the water flows back into it, rather than into the light bulb. The water, which initially seems to splash, gathers back into droplets and fills the balloon. The scene is framed by vertical blurred bars on the left and right sides, which are an overlay on the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
