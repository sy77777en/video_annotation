    "pre_caption": "A medium close-up shot frames a group of students in a classroom setting. In the foreground on the bottom left, one student is visible from the chest up, looking down. Positioned in the center middle ground is another student with glasses, who serves as the primary focus. To his right in the middle ground, a third student is shown from the chest up, holding a pen. Behind the central student, a fourth student is partially visible. The background contains other students seated in rows, all of whom are out of focus, creating a sense of depth. The camera remains static at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of young East Asian men, likely students, are seated in what appears to be a classroom setting. They are all wearing matching dark, high-collared jackets. In the foreground on the left, a young man with dark, neatly combed hair looks down intently. Behind him, another young man dressed in white clothing is visible, not wearing glasses. To his left, in the center of the frame, another young man with dark, wavy hair and black-rimmed glasses is also looking down, focused on something in front of him. Further to the right, a third young man with short, dark hair holds a pen and looks down as if writing. A fourth young man, also wearing glasses, is partially visible behind the central figure. All the men appear to be concentrating on their work.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In what appears to be a classroom or lecture hall, several young East Asian men are seated in rows. They are dressed in matching dark, high-collared jackets that resemble uniforms. The men, some of whom wear glasses, are looking down with focused expressions, seemingly engaged in writing or reading from materials on their desks. The scene has a vintage quality due to the low image resolution, which gives it an aged appearance. The entire video is in deep focus, capturing both the students and the background with clarity.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
