    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, two stationary figures are positioned in the bottom center of the frame, situated in the middle ground on a dirt path that recedes from the foreground toward the background. Boulders are scattered throughout the middle ground, with a line of trees in the background positioned below a large mountain range that fills the upper half of the frame. A dark shadow overlay initially covers the middle and background, then expands to darken most of the scene. Subsequently, the shadow shifts, creating a lit horizontal band across the middle-lower portion of the frame, leaving the top and very bottom areas in shadow before the overlays partially fade.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two animated figures are seen from behind, remaining stationary. The figure on the left is purple, and the one on the right is blue. Both have simple, vertically oriented rectangular shapes resembling hair. The left arm of the blue figure is briefly visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an animated outdoor setting, two small, stylized figures—one purple and one blue—stand stationary on a dirt path through a vast, green valley. The valley is scattered with large gray boulders and is situated at the base of a towering, rocky mountain range, with a line of dark green trees in the distance. The scene is predominantly dark, as shadows initially appear in the middle and upper parts of the frame, gradually deepening and leaving a bright area at the bottom. This horizontal shadow-free band then shifts upward to the middle-lower section, casting shadows on both the bottom and top of the frame. After a brief pause, the shadowed areas gradually fade but do not completely disappear, as these shadows are due to overlays.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
