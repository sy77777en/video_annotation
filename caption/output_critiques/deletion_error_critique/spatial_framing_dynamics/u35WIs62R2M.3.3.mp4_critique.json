    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a seascape, which serves as the primary focus. The scene is framed from a high, tilted angle, looking down on the water. The ocean fills the majority of the frame, extending from the foreground at the bottom edge into the background. The sky is visible in the upper portion of the frame, in the background, with the horizon line tilted diagonally from the upper left to the middle right. A single, dark, wispy cloud is located in the upper left quadrant, and a bright light source is positioned in the upper center of the background, creating a reflection on the water's surface in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an aerial seascape scenery shot, captured from a high, tilted angle looking down upon a vast expanse of water. The deep teal ocean is covered in a fine texture of countless small ripples, stretching out towards a hazy horizon. In the upper portion of the frame, a soft, bright light, likely the sun, diffuses through the atmosphere, illuminating a single, dark teal, and wispy cloud formation that drifts across the pale sky. The composition intentionally lacks a main subject, directing the viewer's focus instead to the immense scale of the ocean and the serene, atmospheric quality of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a high-angle, tilted view over a vast expanse of deep teal water. The water's surface is covered in a fine, rippling texture that extends to the horizon. In the upper portion of the scene, a hazy, pale yellow sky suggests either sunrise or sunset, with a bright light source casting a wide, diffuse reflection across the water. A single, dark teal, wispy cloud extends horizontally from the upper left.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
