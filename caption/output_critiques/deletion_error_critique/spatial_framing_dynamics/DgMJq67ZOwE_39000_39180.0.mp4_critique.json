    "pre_caption": "This is a full shot filmed at the subjects' level, where a silhouetted figure in a dress occupies the middle ground, positioned slightly right of the frame's center, and walks steadily toward the camera. To the left, another figure in a jacket is in the foreground, walking away from the camera toward the middle ground. A third, less distinct figure is visible in the background, positioned behind the central figure and also moving toward the camera. The scene is set on a wet path that stretches from the foreground into the hazy background, flanked by dark walls. A bright backlight, located in the top-center background, pierces through the fog, creating the silhouettes and casting reflections on the ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark and foggy setting, three silhouetted figures are on a wet path. The most prominent figure, a woman slightly to the right of the frame's center, wears a dark, long-sleeved, mid-calf dress with a pronounced hourglass silhouette created by a cinched waist and padded hips; she is wearing a hat and walking toward the camera. To her right, another person wears a dark, oversized jacket, dark briefs, and dark knee-high socks or boots, and is walking away from the camera. A third figure is visible in the background, walking toward the camera, partially obscured by the fog.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, several silhouetted figures walk down a narrow, dark passage filled with dense, white mist. A single, bright backlight at the far end of the passage pierces through the haze, illuminating the scene and casting long, distorted reflections on the wet pavement. The passage is flanked by dark, indistinct walls, with the structure on the left featuring a scalloped upper edge against the foggy backdrop, all within a blue-toned color palette.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
