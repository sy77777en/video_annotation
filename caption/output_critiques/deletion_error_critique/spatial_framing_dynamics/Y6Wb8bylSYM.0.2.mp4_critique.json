    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle medium full shot, positioning the main subject in the bottom right foreground as he rides up an escalator. In the top center background, a second man walks toward the base of the escalator. As the main subject ascends toward the camera, the shot transitions into a medium close-up, and the camera's position lowers to become level with him. In the final composition, the main subject occupies the center-right foreground, holding a badge toward the center of the frame, with the second man now positioned in the middle ground behind him.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a light-skinned man with short, slicked-back brown hair and a receding hairline, who is standing at the bottom of an escalator. He wears a brown jacket over a yellow and black patterned collared shirt, with a silver chain necklace visible at his open collar. He smiles while holding up a black wallet to display a silver, circular badge. In the background, another man, seen from a high angle, wears a dark blue jacket and black trousers and approaches the escalator, reaching its bottom.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting with a dark, concrete-like floor, a man in a brown jacket and a yellow patterned shirt stands at the bottom of an escalator. The escalator features silver metal sides and black handrails. In the background, another person in a dark suit approaches the escalator, reaching its base. To the right of the escalator, a metal grid-like fence is visible, with ladder-like objects and solid red railing-like structures leaning against it. At the start of the video, a portion of a lighting fixture is visible at the far left of the frame, but it eventually moves out of view to the left side of the screen. As the man at the bottom of the escalator holds up a black wallet, he reveals a silver badge.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
