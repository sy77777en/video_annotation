    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a woman in the foreground, her face positioned slightly right of center as she embraces another figure whose head is in the center of the frame. Blurred green foliage and stone structures occupy the background. The camera then slowly pulls back, transitioning the shot into a medium close-up. This movement reveals more of the woman's upper body and the person she is holding, while they remain centrally located within the frame. The camera maintains a position at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with a light complexion and long, dark brown hair styled in braids and dreadlocks is shown in a close-up. Her eyes are initially slightly open before closing, and her mouth is slightly agape, with dark makeup around her eyes. Her left arm, wrapped in light-colored bandages or bracers, features intricate green swirling tattoos or body paint. She wears a sleeveless, rustic-looking top and is tightly embracing another figure, whose head with dark hair is partially visible as she rests her cheek against it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit, overgrown environment, possibly within ancient ruins, where blurred stone structures and green foliage are visible in the background. The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting a shaded area during the day. Small, glowing red particles drift slowly through the air. In the foreground, a woman with long, dark hair is seen in a close-up embrace. She is dressed in rustic attire, with her forearms wrapped in bindings, and her left arm features green, swirling, tattoo-like patterns.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
