    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a static medium shot of a woman standing in profile on the left side of the frame. She is positioned in the middle ground, behind a counter that extends from the bottom left foreground. To her left, a popcorn machine sits in the middle ground. A man then enters from the right side of the frame and walks into the middle ground, stopping to face her. The composition becomes a medium two-shot, with the woman on the left and the man on the right, both in profile. In the background, a hallway with a staircase is visible in the center-right of the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video first shows a young, light-skinned woman with long, dark brown hair pulled back into a ponytail. She is wearing a light-colored, patterned button-up shirt with dark panels on the shoulders and collar. She stands in profile, facing forward to the right of the frame and smiling. A young, light-skinned man with short, dark, wavy hair then enters from the right. He is wearing a dark jacket over a dark shirt. The two stand facing each other in profile, appearing to be in conversation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space, resembling a movie theater concession area. A woman stands behind a counter equipped with a cash register and a stainless steel appliance. To her side is a classic popcorn machine, with a red neon sign where only the stylized \"corn\" part is visible due to the woman's head partially obstructing the view. The environment is bathed in warm, yellow lighting. In the background, a dark hallway with a visible staircase leads upwards, illuminated by wall sconces. A green exit sign is mounted above the hallway entrance, and the background walls have a marbled texture. A man stands in front of the counter, facing the woman.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a girl in a medium shot on the left side of the frame; then a man enters from the right side of the frame. Finally, it presents a medium shot of both of them in profile.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
