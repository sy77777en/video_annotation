    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured from a high angle, two fighters are initially positioned in the left-center of the frame in the middle ground, with the fighter in white shorts on the left and the fighter in black shorts on the right. A referee stands in the background on the right side of the frame. The fighter in black shorts moves forward, pushing the other fighter against the cage on the left. He then lifts the fighter in white shorts and throws him down onto the mat. The sequence ends with the fighter in white shorts on his back in the bottom left of the frame, while the fighter in black shorts stands over him in the left-center, both remaining in the middle ground. The referee stays in the background, observing the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows two men engaged in a mixed martial arts fight. The man on the left has a medium skin tone, short dark hair, and is wearing white shorts with red designs and black gloves; he is initially standing in a fighting stance with his fists raised. The other man has a lighter skin tone, short light brown hair, and is wearing black shorts with white patterns and black gloves; he is also shirtless and barefoot, facing his opponent with his arms extended. As the sequence progresses, the man in white shorts ends up lying on his back on the mat, while the man in black shorts stands over him, gripping his legs and appearing to prepare for a follow-up action. Both men are barefoot and appear focused on each other throughout the video. In the background, a bald man dressed in black, likely a referee, observes the action. Additionally, numerous spectators surround the area below the fighting platform, attentively watching the match.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within an indoor arena, focused on a brightly lit, octagonal cage enclosed by a black chain-link fence. The fence posts are padded and display sponsor logos such as \"CAZADORES\" and \"SYNTHA-6.\" The floor is a light blue mat with black lines, text including \"FINISH FIRST,\" and a red and yellow logo. In the darkened background beyond the cage, a seated audience is visible. Inside the enclosure, two fighters and a referee are present, with the fighters' movements transitioning from a standing clinch against the fence to one fighter being on the mat. An overlay in the top right corner displays a white \"FN\" logo, and text in the bottom right reads \"COURTESY: ZUFFA L.L.C\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
