    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a high angle, initially frames a patch of green turf with a hole in the bottom-center foreground. A golf ball is suspended in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground, while a person stands in the center background. Other objects populate the middle ground, including a fan and a large pot on the left and a seesaw-like structure in the center. As the golf ball travels from the middle ground toward the foreground and rolls across the turf, the camera moves forward and tilts down to track its movement. This action transitions the framing from a wide shot of the entire scene to a full shot focused on the ball as it enters the hole in the foreground, with the camera positioned directly above it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the background, a person wearing a white cap, a red and white patterned shirt, and medium-colored pants is seen holding a golf club in a follow-through pose. A white golf ball is approaching a higher flat area of green artificial turf with a slope. After landing, it rolls forward uphill and gradually approaches the golf hole on the flat surface in the foreground. The hole is a circular opening cut into the flat area of green artificial turf, with a gray inner wall extending downward. The scene also contains numerous other objects, including an inclined runway, a white fan, a large metal pot, and some wheeled structures, all arranged on a rooftop.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective on a cluttered rooftop during the day, the scene centers on a patch of green artificial turf with a hole featuring a grey, metallic interior. A white golf ball is suspended in mid-air, seemingly on a trajectory towards the hole. The background is a chaotic assembly of various objects, including an inclined runway made from a wooden plank with a road marking. A white and blue fan is positioned next to a large metal pot, both resting on a wooden pallet. Further back, a person in a white cap and red-and-white shirt stands on a makeshift contraption. The entire rooftop is filled with miscellaneous items like a red laundry basket, a wire cage, and an air conditioning unit, all under a pale, overcast sky.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a golf ball rolling into the hole. It begins with a wide shot of the surroundings, including many other objects and a person. The camera then moves forward and tilts down to track the golf ball, ending with a full shot of the ball at the hole.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
