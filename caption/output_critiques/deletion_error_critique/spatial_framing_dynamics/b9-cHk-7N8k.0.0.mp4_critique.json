    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a level-angle perspective. A prominent rock spire is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground and standing upon a rocky outcrop that fills the foreground. To the right, a dense, forested plateau extends from the middle ground into the background. On the left and stretching across the horizon, a vast expanse of canyons and mountains recedes into the deep background. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly zooms in on the central rock spire, causing it to grow slightly larger within the frame and emphasizing it as the focal point while the surrounding landscape remains expansive.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a majestic rock spire against a backdrop of sprawling canyons and mountains under a clear, blue sky. The central spire is a weathered, layered rock formation, wider at the top, with sparse vegetation clinging to its sides. In the distance, layers of mountains and canyons fade into the horizon, while a dense, green forest covers the plateau to the right. The composition emphasizes the grand scale and serene atmosphere of the natural environment. The shot's primary purpose is to convey the vastness of the landscape rather than focusing on a single subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor scene, captured from a level-angle perspective, showcases a vast and rugged canyon landscape under a clear blue sky during sunrise or sunset. The low sun casts long shadows and bathes the scene in a warm, golden light. In the middle ground, a prominent, tall, and slender rock spire made of light-brown, layered stone stands on a rocky outcrop, with a few small bushes growing on its weathered surface. The camera zooms in, offering a dynamic view as the background extends across a deep vista of layered canyons and distant, hazy mountains. A plateau covered in a dense, dark green forest is visible to the right. The scene is framed with black letterbox bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
