    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the Cogsworth figure in the bottom-left foreground and the Lumiere figure in the bottom-right foreground, both set upon a black surface within a reddish-brown counter that occupies the middle ground. Small signs are placed in the immediate foreground before each respective figure. In the background, several people are visible, including a young girl in the center and a woman to the right. The camera, initially positioned above the subjects, slowly moves forward and descends, transitioning the view into a medium shot that focuses on the two figures. As the camera lowers to the subjects' level, Cogsworth on the left and Lumiere on the right become more centered and fill more of the frame, while the people in the background are mostly excluded from the final shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two character figures are displayed side-by-side on a dark surface. On the left is a figure of Cogsworth, a brown, rectangular-bodied clock with a round, light-brown, smiling face, blue eyes, and a visible gold pendulum. He has a gold bow tie and gold, curved arms. On the right is a figure of Lumiere, a gold-colored, three-armed candelabra. The central candle has a face with a mustache and a slight smile, while all three arms are topped with lit, flame-shaped light bulbs. In front of each figure is a small, white sign with a brown border. In the background, a young girl with fair skin and a pink and white headband stands behind a counter to look at the display. To her left, a woman with blonde hair, wearing a white tank top and carrying a black backpack, stands partially in view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor shop setting, two character-themed items from \"Beauty and the Beast\" are presented on a black surface inside a reddish-brown wooden display counter. On the left is a clock resembling Cogsworth, with a reddish-brown body, a smiling face, and a gold pendulum. To its right stands a gold-colored candelabra resembling Lumiere, featuring three arms, each holding a white candle with a flickering, flame-shaped light. Small, framed signs with text are placed in front of each item. In the softly lit background, several people, including a young girl looking down at the display, are visible among other store shelves. The camera slowly moves closer to the two items.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows two non-human subjects in a store. The scene begins with many people in the background while the two subjects are in the foreground. As the camera moves forward and descends, it comes to a medium shot of the two subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
