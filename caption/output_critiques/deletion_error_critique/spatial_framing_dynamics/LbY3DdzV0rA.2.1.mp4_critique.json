    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide, high-angle scenery shot where the primary focus is the dramatic weather. The massive storm cloud formation dominates the top two-thirds of the frame, while the cityscape is situated in the bottom third. In the middle ground, a parking garage occupies the bottom-center, a high-rise building with a crane is in the center, and other buildings and a parking lot are on the left. Trees are visible in the foreground at the bottom right and in the middle ground on the right. In the background, faint mountains are visible on the left, and a patch of bright sky is on the far right horizon. The main spatial dynamic is the rapid movement of the clouds, which roll and billow from right to left, with a dark shelf cloud formation expanding downwards and towards the center, engulfing the sky. A large rain shaft is visible descending from the clouds on the left side of the frame. The camera remains static, capturing the storm's immense scale relative to the stationary city below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, capturing a powerful storm system as it engulfs an urban area in a time-lapse sequence. The sky is a dynamic mass of clouds that shift between shades of white, light gray, and dark gray, rolling and billowing with incredible speed. A large, dense rain shaft is visible on the left. Below this atmospheric turmoil, the city appears small, featuring a multi-story parking garage, a lot filled with cars, and a high-rise building under construction, marked by a tall crane. There is no single main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the overwhelming scale and force of the natural weather event, with the cityscape serving primarily as a reference to emphasize the storm's immensity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An extreme wide outdoor shot captures a cityscape as a massive storm system moves across the sky. The sky is filled with churning clouds that constantly shift in color, ranging from white to light gray and dark gray, forming a large, low-hanging shelf formation. Below, the urban landscape consists of several multi-story buildings, including a taller structure in the center with a white construction crane beside it. A large parking lot filled with cars is situated in the lower-left corner of the frame. Green trees are scattered in the lower foreground, as well as in the lower-right midground and background of the frame. In the distance, faint mountains are visible on the left, and a curtain of rain falls from the clouds. A patch of brighter, sunlit sky is visible on the far right horizon, contrasting with the dark storm overhead. The clouds are in constant, swirling motion.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
