    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a dense forest at night. Initially, a prominent tree trunk is in the foreground on the left, with a cluster of thinner trunks and branches in the middle ground at the center. The camera then trucks slowly to the right, causing the foreground tree to move out of the frame on the left. As the camera continues its horizontal movement, new, pale tree trunks continuously enter the frame from the left and pass through the middle ground, revealing the depth and density of the woods against the pitch-black background. The camera maintains an eye-level height, looking straight into the forest throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a nature scenery shot depicting a dense, dark forest at night. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the eerie and claustrophobic atmosphere of the nocturnal woods rather than a specific object. The camera slowly pans across a multitude of pale, slender tree trunks that stand starkly against the pitch-black background, their light-colored bark faintly illuminated by an unseen source. In the shadowy gaps between the foreground trees, a tangled web of thinner, darker branches and trunks creates a sense of depth and impenetrable darkness.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, pans slowly to the right through a dense forest at night. The scene is pitch black, with only the immediate area in front of the camera illuminated, revealing the tall, bare trunks of numerous trees. The trees are closely packed, their pale, grayish bark standing out against the surrounding darkness. A few smaller, leafless branches are visible in the undergrowth on the dark forest floor.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
