    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, walking up a long flight of stairs. He moves directly away from the camera, receding toward the background at the top of the frame. The stairs dominate the composition, extending from the foreground at the bottom to the background at the top, and are framed by dark walls on the left and right sides. In the background, at the top center, three silhouetted figures are visible. The static camera is positioned at the bottom of the stairs, looking up from a low angle. A text overlay is present in the bottom-left foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, seen from behind, walks up a long flight of stone stairs. He is hunched over and wears a tan hooded jacket and dark-colored trousers. In his left hand, he carries a crumpled white object. At the top of the stairs, three other people are visible only as dark silhouettes against a bright, turquoise-colored light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor, nighttime scene is centered on a long, steep concrete staircase viewed from the bottom looking up. The stairs, which have some litter scattered on them, are flanked by dark, rough-textured walls, creating a narrow passage. Silver metal handrails run along both sides. The environment is dark, illuminated primarily by a bright, cyan-colored light at the top of the stairs, where the silhouettes of a few people and streetlights are visible. A person wearing a tan hooded jacket and dark pants walks up the stairs, away from the viewer. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text \"JOKER (2019)\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
