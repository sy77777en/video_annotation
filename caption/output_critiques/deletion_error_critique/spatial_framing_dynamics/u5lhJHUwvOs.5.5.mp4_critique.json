    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a young man with blonde hair is positioned in the center-foreground of the frame, with the camera at his level. The background is composed of a white wall with a red line on the left and a glass wall on the right. The camera pans slightly to the right, keeping the main subject centered as he turns his head. This movement reveals a second man in the background to the right of the main subject and a third man in the far-left background, visible behind the glass wall.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man of East Asian descent with short, bleached blonde hair stands in the foreground. He is wearing a black, sleeveless tank top, black-framed sports glasses, and small earrings in both ears. He has a focused expression as he looks down and to his side. In the midground, another man with short, dark hair and a grey t-shirt is visible. Occasionally, a third man with short hair and a grey collared shirt appears in the background during camera movements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a squash court, characterized by white, textured walls with a horizontal red line, above which the walls are brown. In the midground, a glass wall separates the court from an adjacent area where another person is partially visible. A clock and a framed document are mounted on the far wall, and the space is illuminated by overhead lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
