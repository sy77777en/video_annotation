    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot with no main subject, focusing on an urban environment. The video opens with a low-angle, upward-looking perspective from within a narrow alley. A brown brick building is positioned in the center middle ground, framed by a dark structure in the left foreground and another building in the right middle ground. The camera then tilts down while simultaneously pulling backward, transitioning the view. The final composition shows the full length of the dark alley from a low-angle perspective, with the foreground buildings on the left and right framing the shot and leading the eye toward a brightly lit street in the background at the center of the frame. A text element is visible on the left foreground wall, and a logo remains in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing the perspective from within a narrow, shadowy urban alleyway. The view initially tilts up towards an old, weathered brick building before the camera moves backward along the constricted passage, which is flanked by a mix of traditional architecture and modern glass-fronted structures. There is no main subject, as the focus is placed entirely on the environment itself, emphasizing the architectural textures, the interplay of light and shadow, and the claustrophobic yet compelling atmosphere of the hidden city space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dark, narrow urban alleyway, where the perspective pulls back from an upward view of the surrounding buildings to reveal the length of the passage. The alley is flanked by tall structures, including a brown brick building with white-framed windows and another with a modern glass facade. Deep shadows within the alley contrast with the bright daylight visible at the far end, where a street can be seen. A sign reading \"RUSH ACADEMY\" is installed on the exterior wall of a building. A separate white logo containing the letters \"IK\" is present in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
