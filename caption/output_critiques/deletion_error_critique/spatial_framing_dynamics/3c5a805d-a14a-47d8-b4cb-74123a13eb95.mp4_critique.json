    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a person's back and hair in the center of the frame as they fall backward onto a green surface in the foreground. The camera, initially positioned at the subject's level, tilts downward to follow their movement. As the person settles on the ground, the shot transitions to a medium close-up from a high angle, looking down at their upper body. In the final composition, the person lies across the lower half of the frame, with their head in the center-left and their outstretched arms extending toward the right, all against the green surface that fills the entire scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, light brown hair, wearing a light blue short-sleeved t-shirt, is shown collapsing backward. The video concludes with her lying on her back on a green surface, her arms spread out to her sides. Her face is visible in a blurry profile, looking upward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit setting, a person with long hair wearing a light-colored shirt collapses backward onto a green, textured surface resembling artificial turf. The camera maintains a close perspective as the person comes to rest lying on their back with their arms spread out. The focus softens as the motion ceases, blurring the details of the individual on the uniform green ground.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: At the beginning of the video, only the head of the person is captured, occupying a small part of the bottom of the frame. As the woman lies down, the camera tilts down to show her upper body in a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to above the subject.",
