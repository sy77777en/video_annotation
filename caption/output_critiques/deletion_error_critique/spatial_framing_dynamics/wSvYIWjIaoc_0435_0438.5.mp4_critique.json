    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a person in a wetsuit, viewed from a low-angle, underwater perspective. The subject is positioned in the center-middle ground, ascending toward the water's surface, which appears as a bright opening in the background at the top of the frame, ringed by foliage. As the person moves upward and away, the camera follows, and both break through the water's surface, transitioning the shot. The camera is now at the subject's level, at the water's surface. The person, now smaller in the frame, moves from the center-middle ground toward the background, causing the shot to become a medium long shot. In the final framing, the water occupies the foreground and middle ground, while the sunlit, foliage-lined opening fills the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a full-body, dark-colored wetsuit is shown in the water. On their left wrist, they wear a watch. The video captures the person from an underwater viewpoint, looking up from behind as they ascend toward the surface. They then break through the water's surface, with their head and shoulders emerging. The person is also wearing a diving mask or goggles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place during the day in a natural, outdoor body of water, such as a cenote or sinkhole. The camera's perspective begins underwater in the dark, clear water, looking up at a curved opening to the bright, partly cloudy sky. This opening is ringed by rocky ledges and dense green trees and foliage. A person wearing a blue wetsuit ascends toward the surface, their movement creating bubbles in the water. The view then transitions to the surface, showing the person swimming in the calm, dark blue water, surrounded by the sunlit, verdant landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
