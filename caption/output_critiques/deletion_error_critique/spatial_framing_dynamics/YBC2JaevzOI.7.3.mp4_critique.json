    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a person is initially squatting in the center of the frame and the middle ground. They hold a light source in their right hand and a shoe in their left, both also positioned centrally. The person then places the shoe down, moving it to a lower central position, before standing up. This action causes the person to transition from a low central position to a taller one, while remaining in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The surrounding environment is completely dark, obscuring any other spatial elements. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a nearly pitch-black setting, a slender, pale-skinned young man is faintly visible. He is wearing a baseball cap and a pale green or grey long-sleeved hooded shirt. Holding a small light source, likely a mobile phone flashlight, in his right hand, he initially squats to examine a canvas shoe in his left hand. He then suddenly releases the shoe and stands up, with much of his body still obscured by deep shadows.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in an almost completely dark environment, rendered in near-total blackness. Centrally, a young man is faintly discernible, dressed in a green-grey long-sleeved hoodie and holding a small light source, similar to a cell phone flashlight, in his right hand, emitting a steady, warm white glow. An oval reflection, likely a lens flare, appears to move across the person. In the lower right corner, something resembling a withered plant branch is vaguely visible in the first part of the video, which later goes out of view as the camera moves.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
