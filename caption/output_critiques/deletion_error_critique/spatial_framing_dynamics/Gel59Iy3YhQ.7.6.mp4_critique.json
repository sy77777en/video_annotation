    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a central humanoid figure positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, holding a staff that extends toward the top-right and a sword at the bottom-center. In the background, a large, monstrous figure is visible in the top-center, framed by a glowing red rift, with silhouetted trees occupying the middle ground on the left and right. The camera then slowly zooms out, transitioning to a full shot that reveals the central figure's entire body. This movement expands the view to include more of the rocky terrain in the foreground and middle ground, while the subjects maintain their respective positions within the frame. Throughout the shot, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A central humanoid figure is shown wearing a dark, heavy cloak with a thick fur collar. Its face is concealed by a mask that resembles an owl's head, featuring glowing red eyes and two small, deer-like antlers on top. This figure holds a gnarled wooden staff with a glowing purple orb at its tip in one hand and a sword in the other. In the background, a large, monstrous figure with a jagged and fragmented silhouette appears, seemingly composed of chaotic, rocky material.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark and misty, otherworldly landscape, silhouetted, gnarled trees stand on uneven, rocky terrain. The background is dominated by a large, glowing red energy rift that illuminates the hazy atmosphere, with floating rocks suspended in the air nearby. A central, cloaked figure wearing a horned mask with glowing red eyes holds a staff topped with a glowing purple orb. The scene, cast in shades of red, purple, and black, slowly moves backward to reveal more of the desolate surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
