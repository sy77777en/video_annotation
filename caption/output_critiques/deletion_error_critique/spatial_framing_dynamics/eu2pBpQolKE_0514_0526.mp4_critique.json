    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium-full shot of a diver in a yellow wetsuit positioned in the left-center foreground, ascending vertically. To his right, in the middle ground, a safety diver hovers near a central guide rope, while another diver is visible in the right background. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, moves upward with the main diver, maintaining his central framing. The camera then briefly tilts up, shifting the diver to the bottom of the frame and bringing the water's surface and the underside of a platform into the upper and central view. The camera tilts back down, re-establishing the medium-full shot with the diver in the center, now flanked by two safety divers in the middle ground. As the main diver continues his ascent and breaks the surface, the camera follows, transitioning to a surface-level shot where he occupies the center foreground. A white platform is visible to the right, with other people in the water and on the platform filling the middle ground and a rocky cliff in the distant background. A data overlay remains stationary in the bottom-left corner throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video focuses on a man underwater wearing a form-fitting, long-sleeved, yellow wetsuit with black panels on the sides and a matching yellow hood. He has a nose clip on and a black watch on his left wrist. He is ascending vertically along a white rope. He is accompanied by several other divers. Two of these divers, acting as safety personnel, are men wearing white t-shirts with a circular logo over their dark wetsuits and diving masks. Another diver in a full black wetsuit with a white belt and fins is also present. As the man in the yellow suit nears and breaks the surface, a crowd of people becomes visible, some treading water and others on a white floating platform.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors during the daytime in a body of water with a distinct green tint. From an underwater viewpoint, a white vertical guide rope descends from the brightly lit surface. As the video progresses, the underside of a floating platform and the silhouettes of people become visible. The perspective follows a freediver in a yellow and black wetsuit ascending along this rope, accompanied by several other divers, some of whom wear white t-shirts with \"SAFETY\" printed on them. The view moves upward with the diver, eventually breaking the water's surface to show a white floating platform surrounded by people, with natural rock cliffs visible in the background. A persistent overlay is located in the bottom-left corner, displaying a Russian flag icon with the text \"RUS\" to its left, the name \"ALEXEY MOLCHANOV,\" a running timer, and changing depth measurements, with a semi-transparent \"130m\" between the timer and depth measurements.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video captures divers in the sea, focusing on one person wearing yellow, shown in a medium-full shot. There are other people in the frame, but they are not the primary focus. The camera then tilts up to capture the sea surface, with only the person’s head remaining in the bottom left corner of the frame. It then tilts back down to refocus on the diver in yellow.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
