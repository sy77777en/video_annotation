    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot of an RV park begins with a paved road curving from the bottom left foreground into the center middle ground. In the left foreground, a wooden fence is visible. As the camera pans slowly from left to right, the road shifts to occupy the left and bottom of the frame, revealing a long line of RVs parked along the right side, extending from the middle ground into the background. The pan concludes with a prominent, bullet-shaped trailer positioned in the right middle ground. Trees are distributed throughout the foreground, middle ground, and background, framing the scene. The camera maintains a consistent eye-level height throughout the movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a scenic view of a large, wooded RV park, showcasing numerous recreational vehicles, including large Class A and smaller Class C motorhomes, parked along a winding, paved road. The park is filled with mature, leafy green trees that provide ample shade over the campsites, which are situated on grassy and dirt areas. Several RVs have a van-like appearance, featuring a white or beige base color complemented by dark trim. Towards the end of the video, a trailer RV stands out with its light brown and dark gray color scheme, accented by black and white streamlined decorative stripes, and a notably curved, \"bullet-shaped\" front design. The camera's slow pan captures the overall environment and atmosphere of the campground, focusing on the scale and layout of the park rather than highlighting a specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A daytime view of a recreational vehicle park shows a paved road curving through the area, with wet patches on the asphalt. The road splits into two lanes ahead, providing clear direction for vehicles navigating through the area. The camera pans slowly from left to right, revealing numerous large RVs and motorhomes, predominantly white and beige, parked on grassy lots. The park is heavily wooded with many mature, green-leafed trees providing shade throughout the scene. A simple wooden fence is visible on the left, and the sky above is partly cloudy.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
