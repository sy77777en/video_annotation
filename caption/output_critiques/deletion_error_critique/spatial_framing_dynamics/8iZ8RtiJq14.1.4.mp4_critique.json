    "pre_caption": "The shot presents a close-up of a corkboard, with various elements arranged in the middle ground and foreground. Initially, a label with a yellow bar is positioned in the top center, connected by a red string to a cutout of a pointed building on the left and a label with a question mark in the bottom center. Another question mark label is at the top left, and a label with a purple bar is in the bottom right. A slow camera movement pans slightly left and up, altering the composition. This movement reveals a cutout of a man's upper body, which enters the frame from the left and settles in the middle ground. Consequently, the yellow-barred label shifts to the top right of the frame, while the pointed building cutout moves closer to the center-left. The red string, connecting the various push-pinned items, remains stretched across the middle ground throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot reveals a corkboard arranged like an investigation board. Several small, white rectangular paper labels are affixed to the board with red push pins. Some of these labels have large, black question marks printed on them. One label, initially appearing at the top center of the frame and shifting to the right side by the end of the video, features a yellow bar at the top, with text below it that includes \"$1,000,000$\" and a code, \"676XDH01P6\". Another visible label has a purple bar at its top. A thin red string is stretched between the push pins, connecting the various labels and cutouts. Among the items pinned to the board are black and white cutouts, one of which is a tall, pointed building. Another cutout, partially visible on the left, shows the upper body of a man wearing a suit.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A close-up view focuses on a tan, textured corkboard. Several small, white pieces of paper are tacked to the board with red pushpins, and a red string is stretched between them, connecting the various items. Some of the papers display large black question marks, while others are cutouts of a pointed structure or the upper body of a man. In the upper center, a prominent white paper has a yellow bar at the top and overlay text that includes \"$1,000,000$\" and \"676XDH01P6.\" This paper shifts to the right side by the end. Another small paper with a purple bar is visible in the lower right.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot presents a close-up of several labels fixed on a board, along with a sticker of the upper body of a person that appears as the camera moves.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Due to insufficient background information, it is difficult to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
