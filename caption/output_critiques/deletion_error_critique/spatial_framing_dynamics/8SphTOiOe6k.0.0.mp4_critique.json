    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, eye-level scenery shot of a street corner. Traditional two-story buildings occupy the background and middle ground, forming an L-shape across the top half of the frame. In the middle ground, at the base of the buildings, a food stall with a green awning is positioned on the left, while another shop is on the right. A tall blue signpost stands in the center-right of the frame, with a stone monument to its right. Pedestrians are scattered across the foreground and middle ground; a group is visible on the bottom left, and three women in kimonos stand on the bottom right. The camera remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a sunlit street corner in a Japanese town. The scene is framed by traditional two-story buildings with cream-colored walls, dark tiled roofs, and reddish-brown wooden paneling. Several shops are open for business, including a food stall under a green awning and another advertising orange-themed products. Pedestrians, some wearing face masks, populate the sidewalk, while three women dressed in elegant kimonos—one in pale purple and the other two in a neutral beige—stand at the bottom right of the frame. The video lacks a single main subject, as the composition is designed to capture the overall atmosphere and vibrant daily life of the bustling commercial street.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An eye-level shot captures a bustling street corner in Arashiyama, Kyoto, under a clear blue sky with a few white clouds. The scene is framed by traditional two-story Japanese buildings with beige stucco walls, dark tiled roofs, and wooden-slatted upper windows. On the first-floor level, shops are open for business, including a food stall on the left with a green awning and another shop to its left, featuring prominent red and black signs with Japanese characters. In the center and slightly to the right, a tall blue signpost with a white circular pedestrian next to a smaller circular figure and a white bicycle icon stands to the left of a stone monument; another shorter sign to its right provides directions in Japanese to local landmarks. Pedestrians, some wearing face masks, are scattered along the sidewalk, with three women dressed in purple and beige kimonos standing on the right of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
