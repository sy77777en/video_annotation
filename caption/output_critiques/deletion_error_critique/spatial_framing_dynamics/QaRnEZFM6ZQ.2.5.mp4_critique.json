    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man in a suit, who is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, walking away from the camera down a corridor. He carries a briefcase in his right hand, also in the central middle ground. As the man moves deeper into the background, the framing transitions to a full shot, revealing his entire body. Concurrently, a second individual in a white suit, initially in the central background, walks toward the camera, moving into the middle ground. The corridor's grated walkway runs down the center of the frame from the foreground to the background, while vapor swirls around the main subject's legs in the middle ground. The camera remains positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark, neck-length hair walks away from the viewpoint, positioned centrally with his back turned. He is dressed in a tailored light blue suit jacket and matching trousers, paired with white shoes that feature dark soles. In his right hand, he carries a rigid, rectangular silver metallic briefcase, holding it by its handle at his side as he moves forward. In the central midground, another individual is approaching the camera, dressed in a full-body white protective suit.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A person in a light blue suit, seen from behind, walks down a narrow, sterile corridor carrying a silver briefcase. The corridor is illuminated by overhead lights that cast a cool, blue-green tint on the white, segmented walls. A dark metal grate walkway runs down the center of the floor, flanked by low, vented panels. White vapor billows out from a ventilation panel on the left side, swirling around the person's legs as they move forward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
