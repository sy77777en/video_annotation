    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot from a high angle, a submarine is positioned in the center of the frame, its hull extending diagonally from the upper left to the lower right in the middle ground. The camera then descends and pans to the right, tracking the submarine as it moves forward. This motion shifts the perspective from above the vessel to a position at the level of its sail, maintaining a medium shot as the submarine continues to occupy the center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A grey submarine is shown submerged in water with a blue hue. A light source from above, out of the frame, resembling sunlight, reveals the scene, creating shifting patterns of light and shadow across the submarine's long, cylindrical hull. The vessel has a prominent sail, or conning tower, with the number \"722\" painted on its side in white. Several periscopes and masts extend upwards from the top of the sail, while the corners of the frame remain dark.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In the vast expanse of the ocean, a submarine glides steadily forward. The vessel's grey, metallic conning tower, marked with the white number \"722,\" rises from its long hull. Light filters down from above and out of the frame, resembling sunlight, and casts a shimmering, distorted light pattern along the length of the submarine, creating a hazy, blue glow in the otherwise dark environment. An overlay reading \"[1]\" is visible in the bottom left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
