    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle shot focused on the foreground, looking up along parallel rows of Union Jack-draped coffins that extend from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground. As the camera tilts upward and pulls back, the shot transitions into a wide shot, revealing the full length of the hall. In the final composition, the rows of coffins are centrally positioned, creating leading lines from the foreground to the background. A woman is revealed standing in the center background, framed at the end of the rows. Symmetrical columns are visible in the middle ground on the left and right sides, and doors are positioned in the upper left and upper right background. The camera's final position is at a level height relative to the woman in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays several parallel rows of rectangular coffins, each completely draped with a red, white, and blue British Union Jack flag, extending from the lower part of the foreground to the background. At the far end of the rows, a woman with short, white hair is visible, lowering her head and looking toward the lower right of the frame at the coffins. She is wearing a dark, long-sleeved garment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a long hall with a dark, polished floor and white walls, multiple rows of rectangular objects draped in Union Jack flags extend into the distance. The red, white, and blue flags cover these objects, forming parallel lines that lead the eye from the foreground to the background. Light-colored columns are symmetrically positioned on both sides of the rows. As the camera moves, more of the hall is revealed, showing a white-haired person dressed in dark clothing standing at the end of the line of rectangular objects. In the background, a black door is visible in each of the upper left and upper right corners at the end of the hall.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with many neatly arranged British flags. As the camera moves, it reveals a person standing in the distance, shown in a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
