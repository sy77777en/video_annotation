    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of two people standing close together in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, against a pink backdrop with musical equipment in the background on the left and right. They then separate, with the man spinning toward the right side of the frame as the woman moves slightly forward and to the left. This movement causes the framing to transition into a medium shot focused on the woman, who is now positioned in the center-left of the frame. The man is consequently in the center-right, slightly further back in the middle ground. Throughout the clip, the camera remains at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with light skin and short, shaggy platinum blonde hair stands next to a man with darker skin and dark hair mostly covered by a backward cap. The woman is wearing a black leather jacket, a black skirt, red socks, and light-colored sneakers. The man is dressed in a matching black leather jacket over a white t-shirt, a red and black plaid kilt, and white sneakers. Initially, they are positioned close together, jointly holding a single microphone as they perform energetically. Later, they separate, with the man spinning around and the woman taking the microphone herself and facing the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a brightly and evenly lit studio with a seamless, bright pink cyclorama wall and floor. In the background, several pieces of musical equipment are arranged, including black speaker cabinets, a large speaker stack, and various amplifiers. A black microphone with a long, black cable lies on the floor, initially held by two people who are moving energetically in the center of the frame, later held by the woman herself.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
