    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, framing a woman from the back in the center-right foreground. In the out-of-focus middle ground, a small group of people is positioned in the center and center-left of the frame, standing on a hill under a cloudy sky. The camera then arcs clockwise around the main subject as she moves slightly forward and to her right, transitioning into a medium close-up. As this happens, another woman enters the frame from the right, and the main subject, now seen in profile in the center of the frame, places her arm around the newcomer. The group in the middle ground is now visible on the left side of the frame. Throughout the shot, the camera remains at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a woman with a brown skin tone and long, black braids styled in a high ponytail. She is wearing a black crop top, light-colored bottoms, and small earrings. Initially facing away from the viewer, the camera moves and arcs slightly clockwise around her, revealing her smile. As this happens, she approaches another woman with light skin and dark hair pulled back in a braid, who is wearing a white and black top. The main subject puts her arm around this woman's shoulders and smiles. In the out-of-focus midground, a small group of people in athletic attire is present, including a woman in a white top and dark shorts, a man in a white t-shirt, and another woman in a maroon outfit.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a barren, light-brown hill under a cloudy, teal-toned sky during dawn or dusk. A group of people in athletic attire are present on the landscape. The camera's perspective shifts from behind a woman with long dark braids to her smiling profile as she approaches and puts an arm around another woman's shoulder. A fine, dotted-like texture is overlaid on the entire video, giving it a grainy appearance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
