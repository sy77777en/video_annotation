    "pre_caption": "This medium full shot centers on a man standing in the middle ground of a grassy field. In the background, a chain-link fence extends across the frame, with a large brick building visible on a hill to the right and a smaller grey structure to the left. The video plays in reverse, beginning with the man completing a baseball swing, his bat moving from the left side of the frame toward the center. A large splash of water, initially covering the man's upper body in the center, rapidly contracts inward toward the bat. Simultaneously, pink fragments from the surrounding space fly inward, coalescing with the water to form a pink balloon on the bat. The newly formed balloon then moves upward, exiting the top of the frame, as the man continues his reverse swing, bringing the bat back over his right shoulder. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with brown hair is captured mid-swing with a silver baseball bat. He is wearing a teal backwards baseball cap, a white and blue short-sleeved T-shirt, and dark green sweatpants. The video shows him hitting a pink water balloon that is falling from above. The footage is edited to play in reverse, creating the illusion that the water balloon contracts and stretches in reverse at the moment of impact, with the liquid splashing outward and momentarily obscuring his upper body. The deflated pink balloon is briefly seen wrapped around the bat before flying away.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place outdoors on a sunny day in a grassy field. In the background, a chain-link fence separates the field from a paved area and a grassy slope, upon which sits a large, multi-story brick building with green trim. To the left, a smaller grey structure is also visible. A person swings a baseball bat, and in reverse playback, the water appears to retract and gather, while fragments of a pink balloon seem to coalesce in the air. As the splash retracts, a deflated pink object is briefly visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
