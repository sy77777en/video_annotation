    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a cityscape, with the focus on the overall scenery rather than a specific subject. In the foreground, occupying the bottom half of the frame, a residential area with low-rise buildings and green trees is shown. The middle ground is dominated by a dense downtown core of skyscrapers positioned centrally, with a prominent white and black high-rise building standing in the center. A body of water is visible in the middle ground on the far left. The background, which fills the upper portion of the frame, features a large mountain range under a partly cloudy sky at the top. The scene is captured from a high-angle, elevated perspective, looking down on the foreground and across towards the city. Throughout the clip, the camera performs a very slow, subtle push-in, moving slightly forward toward the downtown skyline.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an extreme wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing a sprawling urban landscape set against a dramatic backdrop of towering, partially snow-capped mountains under a partly cloudy blue sky. The foreground is filled with a mix of low-rise residential buildings and abundant green trees, leading into a dense midground cluster of downtown skyscrapers and high-rises. There is no single main subject, as the camera's distant perspective is intended to emphasize the grand scale and atmosphere of the location. The focus is on the expansive environment and the juxtaposition of urban development with the vast natural landscape, rather than on a specific object or building.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an elevated, daytime view of the Vancouver cityscape. In the foreground, a residential area with low-rise apartment buildings is interspersed with numerous green, leafy trees. Beyond this neighborhood, the dense downtown core rises with a collection of modern skyscrapers, including a prominent white and black high-rise in the mid-ground. The entire scene is set against a backdrop of a large mountain range under a blue sky with scattered white clouds, with some distant peaks showing patches of snow. A body of water is visible on the left side of the urban landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
