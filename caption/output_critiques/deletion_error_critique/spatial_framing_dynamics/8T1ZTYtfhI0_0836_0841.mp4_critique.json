    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot from a high angle, capturing a diver holding a lobster in the center of the frame and the middle ground, positioned above a rocky seabed that fills the foreground and background. The diver then swims directly up toward the camera, causing the shot to transition into a medium shot as they break the water's surface. The final composition is a medium shot at the diver's level, showing them in the center of the frame and the middle ground, holding the lobster aloft. The water's surface occupies the foreground, while a distant coastline is visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man in a blue, patterned, full-body wetsuit with \"YOUNGBLOODS\" written on the chest is shown both underwater and at the surface of the ocean. He wears a black diving mask with a snorkel, a head-mounted camera, blue gloves, and black fins with white lettering. Throughout the video, he holds a large spiny lobster in his gloved hands. The lobster has a brown and tan segmented body with white spots, a fanned-out tail, and long, reddish antennae.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds in a clear, sunlit ocean, beginning underwater over a rocky seabed with patches of coral. A person wearing a blue patterned wetsuit, diving mask, and fins holds a large spiny lobster, distinguished by its brown and white patterned shell and long antennae. The perspective shifts from the blue depths to the surface of the choppy water, where the person is partially submerged. They continue to hold the lobster aloft against a bright, clear sky, with a distant sandy coastline visible on the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
