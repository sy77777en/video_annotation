    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of two people in the foreground, positioned at the bottom left and bottom right of the frame, both occupying the foreground. The person on the left is seen from behind, while the person on the right is viewed in profile. In the background, a group of people is visible at the far end of the trailer, occupying the center and upper portion of the frame in the background. As the camera zooms out, the shot transitions to a medium shot, now including three people in the foreground: one at the left edge, one at the center, and one at the right edge, all standing at the rear of the trailer. The group of people in the background remains at the far end of the trailer, now occupying a smaller area in the upper center of the frame, shown in a wide shot. The camera remains at the subjects’ height throughout, maintaining a straight-on perspective. The spatial arrangement emphasizes the depth of the trailer, with clear separation between the foreground subjects at the rear and the background group at the far end, and the zoom-out movement increases the visible distance and number of people within the frame. A small, semi-transparent text watermark is present in the lower left corner, overlaying the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows several people inside and at the rear of a long, narrow space, likely a truck trailer. In the foreground, a person with dark, short-to-medium length hair is seen from the back, wearing a light blue collared shirt. Next to them on the right is a person with short dark hair and glasses, wearing a light-colored t-shirt with a black glasses strap hanging behind their neck, also seen from the back. A man with short, light brown hair in a blue and white plaid shirt then appears on the left, touching and gesturing against the back of the trailer. A Black man in a dark blue shirt also briefly enters the frame on the far right. In the background, at the far end of the trailer, a group of several people are standing. Their features are not clear due to the distance and lighting, but one person wears a dark blue t-shirt and light-colored pants, while another is in a light-colored shirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place at the rear of a large, open truck trailer with a metal frame and ribbed interior walls. The trailer’s floor consists of exposed metal rails and beams, and the open doors reveal a group of people standing and moving inside, some facing toward the camera and others away. The environment around the trailer is not visible, focusing attention on the trailer’s structure and the individuals present. The lighting is even, illuminating the scene. Overlay elements include a small, semi-transparent text watermark in the lower left corner that reads “Source: National Nuclear Security Administration,” which is not part of the physical scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a close-up of two people in the foreground, while the background shows a full shot of several other people. As the camera zooms out, it finally presents three people in a medium shot in the foreground and several people in a wide shot in the background.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
