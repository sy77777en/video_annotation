    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a tilted, high-angle close-up of a casino table, where a pile of chips and jewelry is in the center of the frame. A deck of cards sits in the foreground at the bottom left, an ashtray is at the top left, and a hand holding cards is visible in the foreground at the top right. The camera then rotates clockwise while simultaneously pulling back, causing the tilted angle to straighten. This movement transitions the shot into an eye-level medium shot, revealing three people sitting at the table. In the final composition, the table and chips are in the foreground, while the person in the center occupies the middle of the frame, flanked by one person on the left and another on the right, all in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **On a green felt casino table, a pile of circular poker chips in red, green, pink, and black is scattered in the center. Some of the black and red chips feature a small, stylized logo. Mixed in with the chips are a gold-colored chain bracelet and a ring. A patterned deck of playing cards rests on the table. The camera gradually rotates and pulls back, revealing a hand holding several cards with different suits. Other hands become partially visible around the table near the chips. In the final shot, three people sitting at the gambling table are revealed: the person in the middle has light skin, wears sunglasses, and is dressed in a black top with a purple collar and cuffs; the person on the left also has light skin and wears a blue long-sleeved shirt; the person on the right has dark skin and wears black clothes. The person in the middle faces the camera, while the two people on the sides face him, each holding cards of different suits in their hands.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene is captured from an upside-down high-angle, looking down at a dark green felt table. In the center is a scattered pile of circular gaming chips in red, green, pink, and black, some bearing a small marking. Mixed within the chips are a gold-colored chain bracelet and a ring. A silver-colored circular ashtray rests at the top of the scene, while a deck of playing cards is located at the bottom. At the top right, a few fanned-out playing cards are initially shown. As the camera gradually rotates and pulls back, it reveals a hand holding the cards. Other hands become partially visible around the table near the chips. In the final shot, three people sitting by the gambling table are revealed. The entire scene is framed by black borders, accentuating the angled perspective.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a close-up of the casino table, then the camera rolls clockwise while zooming out, and finally presents a medium shot of three people playing cards.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: At the beginning, the camera is positioned above the casino table. After the characters appear, the camera is at the same height as them.",
