    "pre_caption": "The video begins as a full shot with a man positioned in the background, slightly left of center, partially concealed behind a tree. In the foreground, a blurred woman occupies the right side of the frame, also partially hidden by a tree trunk. The focus then shifts from the man in the background to the woman in the foreground, transitioning the shot into a close-up. In the final framing, the woman is in sharp focus on the right, while the man in the background left becomes blurred. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens with a man with dark hair and a dark jacket over a white shirt, who is partially visible as he peeks from behind a large tree trunk in a forest. He is positioned in the middle ground. The focus then shifts from the man to a young woman with fair skin, long platinum blonde hair, and dark blue eyes in the foreground. She is also partially hidden by a tree and is wearing a dark jacket and a thick black collar around her neck. She initially turns her head toward the front before looking forward with a neutral expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a well-lit forest during the daytime, where tall trees with dark, textured bark rise from a ground littered with dry leaves and twigs. The lighting is cool. In the midground, a man in dark clothing is partially visible behind a tree. The camera's focus shifts to the foreground, revealing a woman with long blonde hair and a black collar, who is also partially obscured by a tree trunk.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
