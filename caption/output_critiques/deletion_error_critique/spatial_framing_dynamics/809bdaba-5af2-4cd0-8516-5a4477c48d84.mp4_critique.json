    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a woman is initially positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, running on a track that occupies the bottom portion of the scene, extending from the foreground. The camera, placed at the subject's level, tracks her as she runs from the center toward the left side of the frame. As she moves left, she also travels slightly from the middle ground toward the foreground, causing her figure to become larger within the frame. The background consists of an indistinct, dark, and hazy space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black woman with dark, curly hair pulled back is actively running. She is wearing an orange sleeveless athletic top, dark athletic shorts, and light-colored running shoes. She accessorizes with a white compression sleeve on her right arm and two white socks of the same height, worn below her knees.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A woman runs on a reddish-brown track marked with white lane lines. The surrounding environment is completely dark and filled with a thick, hazy atmosphere that shifts in color. The scene is illuminated by dramatic lighting that alternates between a cool, blue hue and a warmer, yet still dramatic tone, casting varying glows on the runner and the track surface against the indistinct, dark background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
