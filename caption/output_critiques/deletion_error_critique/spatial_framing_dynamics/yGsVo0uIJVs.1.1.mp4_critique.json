    "pre_caption": "A full shot presents a rectangular display positioned centrally within the frame. The display is angled, with its bottom edge situated in the foreground and its top edge receding into the middle ground. A dark frame surrounds the display, occupying the perimeter of the shot. The light-colored surface, covered in dark, linear patterns, fills the central area. A slight reflection is visible on the top part of the frame in the background. The entire scene remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot focuses on a rectangular display surface enclosed within a dark, thick frame. The light-colored surface is covered with fine, dark, granular particles that are arranged into a pattern of numerous parallel lines. The lines run parallel to the edge of the frame, but the camera's perspective creates the illusion of them being diagonal. The lines are not solid but have a textured, slightly irregular quality due to the distribution of the individual particles, creating a visual representation of a uniform, linear pattern.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a close-up focuses on a rectangular, black-framed screen. The interior surface is light-colored and filled with dark, grainy particles. These particles are arranged into a series of straight, parallel lines running parallel to the edge of the frame, creating a textured, linear pattern. A slight reflection is visible on the black frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Cannot decide the relative height due to lack of background information.",
