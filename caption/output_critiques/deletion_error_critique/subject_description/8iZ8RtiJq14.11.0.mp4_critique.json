    "pre_caption": "This video presents a computer-generated, high-angle scenery shot of a suburban home. The focus is on establishing the environment rather than highlighting a specific subject, with the static camera capturing the entire property and its immediate context. The two-story house features a light-colored exterior, a grey shingled roof with a satellite dish, and an attached garage with a basketball hoop. A covered porch extends across the front, and the property is enclosed by a wooden fence on a neat green lawn. Details like a basketball on the driveway, a small slide in the backyard, and a portion of a neighboring house contribute to the typical suburban atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
