    "pre_caption": "This video is a garden scenery shot that reveals a small, man-made waterfall. The scene transitions from a soft blur to a sharp focus, showing water cascading over a wall of large, grey and brown rocks, with a bed of smaller, smooth pebbles separating the rockery from a vibrant green lawn. There is no single main subject, as the focus pull technique is employed to showcase the entire environment. This method emphasizes the tranquil atmosphere and detailed texture of the rock garden and water feature as a complete composition, rather than isolating a specific element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
