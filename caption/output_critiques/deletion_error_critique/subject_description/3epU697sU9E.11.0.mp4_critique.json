    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a street-level view in a dense urban setting. The central focus is a large, silver, three-dimensional \"FOX\" logo mounted on a gray stone wall, which forms part of a building's plaza. In the background, the glass and steel facades of modern skyscrapers rise into an overcast sky, while a few pedestrians are incidentally present; one man in a suit descends a set of stairs, and another man sits at a small table looking at his phone. The shot's composition emphasizes the corporate presence within the urban landscape, making the environment and atmosphere the primary subject rather than any specific person or object. A black metal crowd-control barricade is positioned in the immediate foreground, adding to the public, metropolitan feel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
