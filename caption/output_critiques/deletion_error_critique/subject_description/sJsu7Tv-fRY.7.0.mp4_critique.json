    "pre_caption": "This video presents a high-angle, static shot of a minimalist architectural model depicting a cityscape. The scene is characterized by a grid of gray roads intersecting a pale gray landscape, upon which uniformly designed white, multi-story buildings with grid-like facades are arranged in rectangular and L-shaped configurations. Clusters of small, dark green model trees are interspersed between the structures and on some flat rooftops, providing a natural contrast to the stark, geometric architecture, while a few abstract, solid black shapes are also present on the ground. There is no main subject, as the composition emphasizes the overall urban planning concept, focusing on the scale, layout, and relationship between the built environment and green spaces rather than any single element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
