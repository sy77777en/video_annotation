    "pre_caption": "This video is an urban scenery shot, capturing the view from a moving vehicle as it approaches an intersection on a gloomy, overcast day. The wide, expansive grey sky dominates the upper portion of the view, while below, a white SUV turns onto the road amidst other traffic. The scene is dimly lit, with the soft glow of streetlights and the dark silhouettes of trees and buildings lining the periphery. There is no single main subject, as the focus is placed on the overall atmosphere and the transient experience of driving through the city, emphasizing the environment and the flow of movement rather than a specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

It cannot be determined whether a white SUV is turning into the road; it can only be said that a white SUV is seen in the lower-middle part of the frame at the start of the video. As the camera pans left, the white SUV disappears, and a girl with shoulder-length pink hair wearing sunglasses and a black mask appears in the frame.",
