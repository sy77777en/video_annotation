A prominent, modern building with a highly reflective, mirrored facade stands in the foreground, distorting the reflection of the surrounding city. In the distance, numerous high-rise buildings and residential areas extend towards rolling hills and mountains on the horizon, with a faint graphic overlay of connected points superimposed on the scene. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the expansive scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than to focus on a particular object or individual.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
