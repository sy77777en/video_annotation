    "pre_caption": "A group of seven women begins in a dance formation and performs a synchronized routine, raising their arms above their heads. They then walk and turn to reposition themselves, with a woman in light blue pants moving to the center front. The group continues the coordinated dance in the new formation, with the other members dancing around the central figure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a group of nine young women with light skin tones dancing in a coordinated routine. Initially, two women are at the front. The woman on the left has long, dark brown hair and wears a white, sleeveless, off-the-shoulder crop top with baggy white pants. The woman on the right has long, dark brown hair, a white beanie, a white, long-sleeved crop top, and baggy, light gray pants. As the group repositions, a woman with long, straight, black hair moves to the center, becoming the main focus. She is dressed in a white, short-sleeved crop top with a black waistband and light blue, baggy cargo pants with white patches. The other members dance around her. To her right is a woman with long, golden hair in a white, sleeveless crop top and dark blue jeans with a chain. To her left is a woman with long, dark magenta hair wearing a white, sleeveless crop top and baggy, dark blue pants. In the midground, one woman has a short, black bob and wears a white, long-sleeved top with black shorts and knee-high socks, while another has long, dark brown hair, a gray, sleeveless crop top, and baggy, dark green pants.**",
