    "pre_caption": "This video features a speed ramp effect, with the playback speed changing throughout the shot. The smooth drone camera begins at an eye-level, level-angle view and moves forward. It transitions to an overhead, high-angle perspective as it rolls counterclockwise and pans left to follow a person fishing by the lake. The camera continues its forward motion, rolling clockwise and tilting, which creates a dynamic, varying Dutch angle as it descends to just above the water's surface. The focus starts deep, then shifts to an ultra-shallow depth of field to isolate a fishhook in the foreground as the person casts, before returning to deep focus on the wider scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The video shows a speed ramp effect, where playback speed changes between faster and slower rates.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The shot begins at eye level indoors. It then glides through the window, transitioning to an overhead view of the field, and finally concludes just above the water's surface.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera begins at a level angle. As it moves forward and pans left while tilting downward, it shifts to a high angle. Continuing to fly forward and tilt upward, it returns to a level angle. During the movement, the camera rolls counterclockwise and then clockwise, creating varying Dutch angles.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera begins with deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp and clear. Midway through the flight, it shifts to an ultra-shallow focus on the fishhook in the foreground, rendering the background completely blurred, before returning to deep focus at the end.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone camera begins by moving forward. Midway through the shot, it rolls counterclockwise and pans left to focus on a person fishing by the lake while rolling clockwise and maintaining forward motion in its new direction. Near the end, the focus shifts to the fishhook as the person casts backward, before finally returning to a wider view of the scene. Throughout the video, the rolling movement of the camera introduces a dynamic, varying Dutch angle.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",
