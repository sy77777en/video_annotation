    "pre_caption": "This static extreme wide shot presents a scenery view of a forest. The camera is positioned directly above the treetops, providing a top-down perspective. Golden-yellow and amber treetops are distributed across the entire frame, with the dark, shadowed forest floor visible in the gaps between them, most notably in the top left, bottom left, and top right areas. In this vertical composition, the treetops occupy the highest plane, closest to the camera, while the ground below them forms the lowest plane in the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an aerial scenery shot offering a top-down perspective of a dense, autumnal forest. The treetops, colored in shades of golden yellow and amber, are selectively illuminated by sunlight, creating a stark contrast with the deep, dark shadows of the forest floor below. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the abstract patterns and rich textures of the canopy. The expansive, bird's-eye view emphasizes the scale and atmosphere of the natural environment rather than any specific element within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a top-down view of a dense forest. The treetops, with foliage in shades of golden-yellow and brownish-orange, are illuminated against the dark, shadowy ground. Patches of the dark terrain, with some small white areas, are visible in the spaces between the trees. The overall lighting is low, casting deep shadows across the landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
