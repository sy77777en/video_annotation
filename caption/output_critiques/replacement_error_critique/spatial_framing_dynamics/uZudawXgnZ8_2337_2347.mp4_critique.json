    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot presents a static, high-angle view of a farm scene. In the background, a farmhouse is positioned in the top-center. The middle ground is occupied by a cleared dirt area, which contains a tree in the center, a tilled plot to its right, and a large purple tree in the bottom-right. The surrounding forest frames the scene on the left, top, and bottom edges. A character is positioned in the center-right of the frame, inside the tilled plot. A black \"X\" icon briefly appears directly above the character's head in the middle ground, while a text box simultaneously materializes as a foreground overlay in the bottom-left corner. The character then moves slightly to the left, remaining within the plot. A toolbar is fixed at the bottom of the frame and a clock is in the top-right, both as foreground overlays.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a nighttime scene from a pixel-art game, a character with blue hair, a red top, and blue trousers stands in a tilled plot of soil. A black \"X\" icon appears above the character's head, corresponding to a text box in the lower-left corner that reads, \"You feel sluggish from over-exertion.\" The landscape is filled with dark green and blue-tinted trees, but one tree on the right is notably different, possessing a large, round canopy of glowing, vibrant purple leaves. Scattered across the brown dirt ground are numerous small, round, purple objects that resemble mushrooms. In the upper portion of the scene, a rustic wooden farmhouse with a red roof has three lit windows.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows an outdoor farm scene at night, surrounded by a dense forest. In the upper portion of the scene, a small wooden farmhouse with a lit window sits on a patch of green grass. Below the house is a cleared dirt area containing a single tree, scattered logs, and clusters of purple mushrooms. A character is present in this area, tending to a square plot of tilled soil. The surrounding forest is composed of green and blue-hued trees, with one distinctive tree in the lower right featuring vibrant purple leaves. Several overlay elements are visible: in the top right, a display shows the time is past 9:00 PM, the date is Mon. 1, and the player has 0 gold. At the bottom, a toolbar displays various tool icons. A text box appears in the bottom-left corner with the message, \"You feel sluggish from over-exertion,\" as a cross icon briefly flashes above the character.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
