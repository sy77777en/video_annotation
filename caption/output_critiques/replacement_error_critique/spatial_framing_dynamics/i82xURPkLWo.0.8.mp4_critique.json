    "pre_caption": "In an extreme close-up shot, the right side of a man's face is positioned in the foreground on the right side of the frame, with his cheek pressed against a rifle stock that occupies the bottom and center foreground. A portion of the rifle's scope is visible in the top-left foreground, with his hand on the stock in the center-left foreground. The background is filled with out-of-focus green foliage. The camera then pans down along the rifle, settling on the man's hand in the center foreground, with his index finger on the trigger. In this final framing, the rifle stock occupies the top and left portions of the frame in the foreground, while the blurred green background is visible on the right and bottom. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot focuses on a man with brown skin and a short, dark goatee aiming a rifle. The left side of his face is visible, with his cheek pressed against the dark gray, textured stock of the firearm as he looks through the scope. His lips are slightly parted. The man's hand is shown gripping the rifle, with his index finger resting on the black trigger inside the trigger guard.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting with a blurred green background of foliage, a close-up view captures a person holding a rifle. The person's cheek is pressed against the dark, textured stock of the firearm, near a partially visible scope. Their hand is wrapped around the grip, with an index finger resting on the black trigger inside the trigger guard. The scene is illuminated by natural, daytime light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
