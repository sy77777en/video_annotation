    "pre_caption": "An extreme close-up shot frames a section of a circular, metallic mechanism that occupies the entire frame in the middle ground. The Greek word \"ΑΤΛΥΜΟΙ\" is positioned horizontally across the center, with other letters visible in the top right on an upper ring. Rows of square cutouts are located above and below the central text. A thin, metallic pointer enters the frame from the bottom, moving upward through the foreground. The pointer comes to a stop, positioned vertically in the bottom center of the frame, with its tip pointing directly at the central word.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An extreme close-up view reveals a complex, circular, metallic mechanism with a dark, weathered, and scratched surface. The device is composed of concentric rings, with some featuring rows of small, square-shaped cutouts resembling gear teeth. Raised letters from the Greek alphabet are inscribed on its surface; the word \"ΑIΛΥΜΟΙ\" is clearly visible on a central band, while other letters appear on an upper ring. A thin, dark metallic pointer with a sharp tip moves across the face of the mechanism.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An extreme close-up view reveals a complex, circular mechanism made of dark, weathered metal with a scratched, stone-like texture. The device features several concentric rings, some of which are embossed with raised Greek letters, including \"ΑΙΛΥΜΟΙ\" and \"ΦΑΩΘΙ.\" Between these rings of text are rows of small, evenly spaced rectangular cutouts. A thin, double-bladed metallic pointer extends straight upward from the bottom center of the frame, its tip stopping directly above the word \"ΑΙΛΥΜΟΙ\" in the center, sweeping past the letters in a dark, dramatically lit setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: An extreme close-up of a dial with no background reference makes it impossible to determine the relative height of the shot.",
