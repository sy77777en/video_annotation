    "pre_caption": "In a low-angle close-up, a man's face is positioned in the center of the frame and occupies the foreground. Behind him in the background, a large, rectangular blue light source extends vertically across the scene. A textured wall is visible in the middle ground on the left side of the frame. The camera is positioned below the subject, angled upward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, light-skinned man is shown in a close-up, looking forward and slightly up toward the upper-right of the frame. He has short, dark brown hair and light blue eyes. His mouth is slightly open, revealing his teeth, as if in the middle of speaking. He is wearing what appears to be a white collared shirt under a dark garment, possibly a suit jacket.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting, a man is viewed from a low-angle close-up. His face is illuminated by a large light source with straight edges extending across the frame from top to bottom, positioned behind or above him, which casts a bright blue glow. Within this blue light, indistinct, wispy forms can be seen. The surroundings are dimly lit on both sides, with a portion of a grey, vertically textured wall or pleated vertical curtains visible on the left. Black bars frame the video at the top and bottom edges, and the white text \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" in the bottom left corner is positioned on the bottom black bar.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
