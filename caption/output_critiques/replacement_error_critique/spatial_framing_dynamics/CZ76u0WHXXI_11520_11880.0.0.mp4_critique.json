    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a high-angle, bird's-eye perspective, placing two men in the center foreground on a rooftop ledge. Far below in the background, two other men are positioned in the top left of the frame on the ground. The camera then tilts up and moves in, transitioning to a medium close-up of the two main subjects, who remain centered in the foreground. This new framing is at the subjects' eye level, capturing them from the chest up, with a distant brick building and green landscape now visible in the background, while the two men on the ground are no longer in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a bird's-eye view, top-down perspective, a man in a dark blue uniform with a matching peaked cap holds another man by the collar at the edge of a high structure. The uniformed man, seen mostly from above and behind, grips the other man's clothing with both hands. The man being held is a white man with short dark hair, wearing a buttoned grey shirt with the open collar being gripped by the other man, along with a grey flat cap and a white ribbed undershirt. His arms are outstretched to his sides, and he has a concerned expression as he looks at the uniformed man. Far below them on a concrete surface, two other men in work clothes are seen walking toward the building and looking upward at the main two men. The perspective changes to a level angle at the end.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye view, the scene unfolds on a dark, flat rooftop during a bright, sunny day, which casts distinct shadows. A weathered, rusty metal ledge runs along the edge of the roof. Far below lies a wide, paved yard marked with parallel lines, interspersed with patches of dirt and sparse vegetation. In the midground, a long, two-story red brick building with a uniform pattern of windows is visible, set against a landscape of green, rolling fields and trees. The camera's viewpoint shifts from a direct top-down angle to a level angle, revealing more of the distant scenery. Two figures stand at the roof's edge, while two others are visible on the ground below, but they go out of frame in the latter part of the video due to the camera movements.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
