    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot centers on an ornate antique clock positioned in the middle ground. In the background, out-of-focus bookshelves are visible on the left and right sides of the frame. The camera, positioned at the clock's level, begins a slow clockwise rotation around the subject. This movement causes the entire frame to tilt gradually, with the clock remaining the central pivot point of the shot as the background shifts accordingly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An ornate, antique clock is the central subject, viewed at eye level in a dimly lit room. The clock, which appears to be made of aged brass or a similar metal, has a large, round face supported by a sculpted, stylized figure of a person with their arms raised. The complex clock face features two prominent subdials positioned like eyes and a smaller one below, giving it a face-like appearance. A single, long, dark hand points toward the top of the dial. The entire structure is highly decorative, with finials and intricate metalwork. A strong light from a slightly elevated front-top direction casts a large, cross-shaped shadow across the clock's face. In the out-of-focus background, tall, dark bookshelves filled with books line the walls on either side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit room with a muted green and brown color palette, a large, ornate antique clock is centrally positioned. The circular, metallic clock face features multiple smaller dials and is held aloft by a sculpted figure. As the camera rotates in a clockwise direction, the entire frame gradually tilts, with the clock serving as the central focal point. A strong light shines down at a slight angle from the front-top direction of the clock, casting a prominent cross-shaped shadow across its surface. In the out-of-focus background, tall bookshelves filled with books line the walls on both sides of the room.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
