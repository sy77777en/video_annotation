    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot, centering on a girl visible through a glass-paned door in the middle ground. The door is flanked by a brick wall on the left and white siding on the right. The camera, initially at the girl's level, pulls back and slightly up, transitioning into a wide shot. As the frame expands, the door and the girl shift to the top-left quadrant. This movement reveals a leaf-covered porch roof in the foreground, which occupies the lower-left and center of the frame. Simultaneously, two people emerge from the bottom-right, walking into the middle ground below the upper porch. The right side of the frame reveals a street with cars and trees in the background. The camera's final position is elevated above the two people on the ground floor while remaining at the same height relative to the girl in the upper window.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, fair-skinned girl with blonde hair, wearing a red jacket, is visible through the four-paned glass window of a white door on what appears to be an upper-level balcony. She is sitting and facing towards the left. As the view expands, two people dressed in dark clothing walk out from a lower-level entrance of the same house, emerging from beneath a porch roof. Initially positioned at the bottom-right corner of the frame, the porch gradually shifts to the lower-middle section of the frame as the camera pulls back. The girl remains visible in the upper-level window throughout.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone pulls back from the upper level of a two-story house in a suburban neighborhood. The house features white horizontal siding and a white door with four glass panes, through which a person in a red jacket can be seen. To the left of the door is a red brick wall. A white porch with a railing extends from this level, its roof covered in brown autumn leaves. The camera's movement reveals the surrounding area, including a yard and a street with parked cars, all set against a backdrop of trees with sparse, autumnal foliage under an overcast sky.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of a girl seen through the glass on the door. As the camera moves, it transitions to a wide shot showing two people walking out through the first-floor entrance of the house, with the girl still visible in the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Initially, the camera is at the girl’s level. As the frame changes, its height stays the same relative to her, but above the two people on the first floor.",
