    "pre_caption": "This full shot is captured from a low-angle, worm's-eye perspective, looking directly up from the bottom of a cylindrical metal lattice cage that fills the entire frame. In the foreground, a person occupies the bottom-left quadrant, positioned closest to the camera. Further up in the middle ground, two motorcyclists circle along the curved inner walls of the cage; one moves from the top-left towards the bottom-center of the frame, while the other moves across the upper portion. In the background, at the top center where the lattice converges, several bright lights are visible, creating a strong sense of depth as the cage's structure recedes towards them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a worm's eye view, the scene captures a cylindrical cage made from a silver-colored metal lattice. Inside, three figures are present: one person is standing and dancing, while the other two are riding motorcycles. The individual closest to the camera on the left is standing inside the cage, with dark skin, wearing ripped camouflage pants, a dark purple long-sleeved jacket, a green inner layer, black sunglasses, a thick necklace, and black and white Nike sneakers. Further up inside the cage, one person rides a blue motorcycle, and another rides a dark-colored motorcycle. Both riders are wearing helmets. Several bright white lights are positioned outside the top of the cage, illuminating the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a perspective at the bottom of a structure looking directly upward, the scene is set inside a large, cylindrical enclosure. This enclosure is constructed from a dense lattice of intersecting gray metal bars, forming a web-like pattern that narrows and converges toward the top. At the apex of the structure, several bright, circular lights illuminate the interior. Several figures on motorcycles are in motion, riding along the curved inner surface of the latticed walls.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
