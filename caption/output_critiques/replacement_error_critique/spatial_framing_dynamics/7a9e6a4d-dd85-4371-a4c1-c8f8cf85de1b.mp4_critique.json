    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from an interior viewpoint, framed by dark vertical elements on the left and right, with a lake and hills visible in the center background. The camera moves forward, transitioning to a high-angle wide shot of the exterior scene. It then tilts down and rotates, revealing tall reeds in the immediate foreground on both sides and a wooden boardwalk that extends from the bottom center into the middle ground. As the camera flies forward, it centers on a person standing at the end of the dock in the middle ground, positioned above them. The lake occupies the middle ground, while a town and forested hills are in the background. The scene then transitions to a full shot, centering a fishhook in the foreground against a blurred background of the lake and distant shore.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing dark clothing stands at the end of a wooden dock that juts out into a body of water, surrounded by tall reeds, with a small orange package visible on their back. The focus then shifts to a full shot of a metallic fishhook, which is covered in droplets of water. The hook is curved, with a sharp, barbed point and a textured surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an outdoor scene near or above a lake during dusk or on an overcast day. The drone initially seems to peer through an indoor area before passing through what appears to be a window, revealing tall, dense reeds. It then flies over them to reveal a wooden boardwalk leading to a small dock on the calm water. In the background, a town with houses sits at the base of a forested hill under a gray, cloudy sky. A person stands on the dock. The scene then transitions to a full shot of a textured metal fishing hook, covered with multiple water droplets, against a blurry background of the lake and distant shore. The initial view is framed by what seems to be an indoor scene or window frames on the left and right sides. The shot returns to a wide view after the full shot of the fishing hook.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera begins with a wide shot of the interior space. As it moves outward through the window, the shot transitions to a wide shot of the exterior scene. During this flight, the camera shifts to a full shot of the fishhook, and finally concludes with an extreme wide shot of the lake and mountain landscape.",
