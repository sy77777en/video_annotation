    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot of a woman positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, running on a reddish-brown track that occupies the foreground and middle ground. A green turf field is visible in the background, filling the top half of the frame. As she runs, the camera tilts down to follow her movement, transitioning into a medium shot that focuses on her lower body from the waist down. In this final framing, her legs are centered in the frame and remain in the middle ground, with the track and field maintaining their respective positions. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with brown skin and dark hair pulled back into a ponytail is shown running. She is wearing athletic attire, which includes a form-fitting, long-sleeved grey shirt with thumbholes, short black athletic shorts, and brightly colored running shoes that are orange and purple. The video captures her from a rear and side perspective as she is in motion.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In the warm, low-angle sunlight of either early morning or late afternoon, a person runs on a reddish-brown running track marked with white lane lines. The video begins with a view of the runner from behind and later shifts to a side view. Adjacent to the track is a green artificial turf field with white and yellow painted lines. The runner wears a grey long-sleeved shirt, black shorts, and brightly colored orange and purple running shoes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
