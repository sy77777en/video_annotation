    "pre_caption": "The video opens on a symmetrical scene, with large, angled structures featuring a glowing blue hexagonal pattern framing the left and right sides of the shot in the foreground. Centered between them, a vertical beam of light rises from the bottom of the frame toward a cloudy sky visible in the background. The shot then transitions to a full shot as two figures, a man and a woman, fade into view, sitting in the foreground at the bottom center. The man is on the left and the woman is on the right, both facing away from the camera toward the central view. The camera remains stationary at the subjects' level, maintaining a straight-on perspective from behind them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a man and a woman from behind, who fade into view as they sit side-by-side on a floor. Both are silhouetted and wear black, form-fitting suits adorned with glowing, light-blue lines and a prominent glowing circle on their upper backs. The man, on the left, has a broader build and is sitting with his legs crossed. The woman, on the right, has a more slender frame and short, dark hair in a bob cut, and she is also sitting with her legs crossed. They are both facing away from the viewer, looking out at a distant, cloudy sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, futuristic setting, two silhouetted figures in black suits adorned with glowing blue circuits appear and sit on a platform. They face away from the viewer, looking out at a dark, cloudy sky where a bright light source sits low on the horizon. A vertical beam of light rises from a path below into the sky. The scene is framed on the left and right by large, angled structures whose inner surfaces are covered in a glowing, light-blue hexagonal pattern.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
