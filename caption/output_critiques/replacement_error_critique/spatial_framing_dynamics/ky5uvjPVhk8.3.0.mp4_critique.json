    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture the garden scenery, with the stone-paved path extending from the bottom center of the frame and curving gently toward the middle ground, leading the viewer’s eye deeper into the scene. On the right side of the frame, the traditional wooden building occupies the middle ground and background, its structure running parallel to the path and rising vertically from the bottom right to the top right. The building’s base and stone border are visible at the bottom right, while its upper beams and roof reach toward the top edge. On the left, manicured shrubs, large rocks, and a pond are positioned in the foreground and middle ground, with trees and autumn foliage filling the background and stretching from the left edge to the upper center. A person with a stroller is visible ahead on the path, positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground. The camera height is at eye level, consistent with a first-person perspective, and moves smoothly along the path, maintaining the wide shot and keeping the spatial relationships between the path, building, and garden elements stable throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot featuring a tranquil garden path bordered by lush greenery and vibrant autumn foliage, with a traditional wooden building displaying clean architectural lines and natural materials. The focus is on the harmonious blend of nature and architecture, highlighting the serene atmosphere and the scale of the environment rather than any individual subject. There is no main subject because the intent is to immerse the viewer in the peaceful ambiance and visual balance of the garden and its surroundings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, moves along a gently curving stone-paved path in an outdoor Japanese garden during daylight. The setting features a traditional wooden building with yellow walls and large windows on the right, supported by dark brown beams and surrounded by a low stone border filled with small blue-gray pebbles. To the left, the path  passed manicured shrubs, several large rocks, and a pond partially visible through the trees. The garden is lush with green foliage, interspersed with trees displaying red and orange autumn leaves. A person pushing a stroller is seen ahead on the path, and the overall environment is calm and well-maintained, with no overlays or additional visual elements present.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
