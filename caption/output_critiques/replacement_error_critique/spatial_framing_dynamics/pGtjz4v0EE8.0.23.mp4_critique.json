    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of a large basilica. Initially, the basilica is positioned in the middle ground, slightly right of center, with another building and a construction crane visible in the middle ground and background to the left. A transit stop occupies the foreground, spanning the bottom of the frame. The video then cuts to a new, slightly tighter wide shot where the basilica is now centered in the frame. In this second shot, the foreground transit stop and background crane are no longer in view, and buildings are visible in the background on the right. Throughout both shots, the camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the large structure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a magnificent, light-colored stone basilica, likely the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute in Venice, as indicated by a transit stop sign. The grand structure is defined by its massive central dome, intricate Baroque facade adorned with numerous statues in niches, and ornate carvings. The perspective consistently maintains an eye-level view, transitioning from an overexposed sky, which includes a construction crane in the background, to a clearer shot against a deep blue sky that highlights the architectural splendor and scale of the building. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the impressive atmosphere and environmental grandeur of the historic location. The camera's attention is on the architectural beauty and its place within the city, rather than on a specific character or object. The shot serves to establish a sense of place and awe.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene in Venice, Italy, shows the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute on a bright, sunny day. The large, Baroque-style church is made of light-colored stone and features a prominent central dome and a smaller one beside it. Its facade is decorated with numerous statues, columns, and arches. In the foreground, a yellow and white transit stop enters from the lower left, extends across the entire bottom of the frame, and exits from the lower right, with a sign that reads \"Salute.\" To the left of the basilica stands another building and a construction crane, while buildings with terracotta roofs are visible to the right against a clear blue sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
