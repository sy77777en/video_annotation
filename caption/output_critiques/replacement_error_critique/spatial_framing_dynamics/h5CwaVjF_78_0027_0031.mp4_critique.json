    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured at the subjects' level, the scene opens with one woman in the foreground-center, while five other women are positioned in a loose formation behind her in the middle ground. The group in the middle ground moves backward as more dancers enter the frame, and by the one-second mark, the entire group is bent over or kneeling across the middle ground, with one woman standing in the center-background. As the dancers rise, the head and shoulders of a dancer in the immediate foreground appear at the bottom of the frame, partially obscuring the view. The group then repositions, spreading out horizontally across the middle ground to form a wide line that spans the width of the frame, with the studio's curtained back wall and red side wall visible behind them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of young women with light skin tones are shown performing a dance routine that is not perfectly synchronized. They are dressed in coordinated outfits consisting of white crop tops and various styles of baggy pants, such as jeans and cargo pants. The woman who is often in the center has long, dark brown hair and wears a white, short-sleeved, ruffled crop top with light-wash baggy jeans and white sneakers. Other dancers include a woman with long, blonde hair wearing a white crop top and dark, baggy pants with chains, and a woman on the right wearing a white beanie, a long-sleeved white crop top, and baggy grey pants. Another woman with long, reddish-brown hair wears a white tank top and dark blue pants. One dancer is a light-haired woman wearing a purple baseball cap, a white crop top, and blue cargo pants. Another dancer is a dark-haired woman with short hair, dressed in a white long-sleeve shirt, shorts, and black thigh-high socks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a spacious, modern dance studio with a light-colored wood floor. One wall is partially painted a solid, bright red and is connected with white panels, while the back wall is covered by a floor-to-ceiling gray curtain. The entire left wall is lined with mirrors, though the dancers are not visible in them in the video. The ceiling is a mix of wooden slats and white panels, featuring a large, curved white architectural element and long, rectangular light fixtures that provide bright, even illumination. Additional light strips run along the base of the mirrored wall. Black speakers are mounted at the left edge of the ceiling. A group of female dancers in coordinated casual wear performs a synchronized routine, moving dynamically across the studio space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
