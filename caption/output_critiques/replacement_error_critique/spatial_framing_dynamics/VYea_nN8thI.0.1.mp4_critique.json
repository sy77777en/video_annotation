    "pre_caption": "In this wide shot, a red SUV is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, driving on a long bridge that extends from the foreground into the background. The bridge is flanked by water in the middle ground on the left and right sides of the frame, with a dense forest visible in the background across the top of the scene. The camera begins from a high-angle position above the SUV and executes a smooth, downward arcing motion while tracking the vehicle from the front. This movement lowers the camera's perspective, transitioning to a position at the car's level as it continues to drive forward, maintaining its central framing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A metallic red Ford Kuga SUV is positioned in the center of a two-lane road, driving forward. The vehicle has a black roof featuring a sunroof, black trim around the windows, and a black front grille with a silver Ford logo in the center. It has two large headlights, and the front license plate, which is white with black lettering, reads \"HDI 108\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds during the day on a long, straight bridge spanning a wide body of water. The dark asphalt road is marked with yellow and white lines, guiding a single red SUV with a sunroof as it drives forward. The camera starts with a high-angle shot and smoothly transitions into a downward arcing crane movement, tracking the red car from the front. On both sides of the bridge, dark, rippling water stretches towards a distant shoreline covered in a dense green forest. The perspective moves forward with the car, causing the surrounding environment to appear in motion.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
