    "pre_caption": "This is a low-angle wide shot of a street scene. Two women are positioned in the left foreground, walking away from the camera toward the middle ground. A large building occupies the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, while a tan building is in the center-background and a white house is in the right middle ground. As the women walk, a white taxi enters from the right middle ground and drives horizontally across the frame to the left, passing behind them. Simultaneously, a bus in the background moves slowly from right to left. Other pedestrians are scattered throughout the middle ground and background on both sides of the street. The camera remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a street scene, two women are seen from behind, walking away with natural postures as they chat. The woman on the left has long dark hair and wears a light-colored jacket with a knee-length skirt, paired with high heels. She carries a brown bag over her shoulder and a black handbag in her left hand. The woman beside her is dressed in a black and white plaid top and a dark skirt, also wearing high heels. She carries a bag in her hand and another over her shoulder. A white sedan with a green side stripe and a taxi light on its roof drives across the scene. In the background, a white and green bus is moving slowly, and several pedestrians are scattered on both sides of the street or in front of buildings, dressed in business or casual attire, either walking or standing still.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor town setting under a clear blue sky, two women walk away from the camera on a wide, paved street. The late afternoon sun casts long shadows. The street is lined with buildings of varying styles, including a large, multi-story, light-gray building on the left, a smaller tan building in the background, and a single-story white wooden house on the right. In the mid-ground, a white taxi with a green stripe drives across the road. In the background, a green and white bus moves slowly down the street, where other people are walking.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
