    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot, captured from a top-down perspective, frames a character in the center-right middle ground, standing on a wooden pier. The pier extends from the left side of the frame, with a wooden building situated on it in the upper-left-of-center, also in the middle ground. The blue water fills the majority of the scene, occupying the foreground at the bottom and surrounding the pier in the middle ground, while a sandy beach is visible in the background at the top of the frame. In the foreground, a user interface toolbar is positioned along the bottom edge, a status display is in the top-right corner, and an energy bar is in the bottom-right. A \"Trash\" box, initially in the bottom-left foreground, fades and disappears by the two-second mark. The only other movement is the slight bobbing of the fishing line's buoy in the water directly below the character.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel art video game scene, a character with silver-gray, spiky hair stands on a wooden pier, wearing a red shirt and dark pants. The character is holding a fishing rod, with its line cast into the water where a small, round, red-and-white bobber floats. To the left of the character is a wooden building with a red gabled roof and a sign displaying the word \"FISH.\" A user interface is present, featuring a hotbar at the bottom of the screen that shows various tools, including an axe, a pickaxe, and the selected fishing rod. In the top right corner, another interface element displays the in-game time, date, and currency.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides, captures an outdoor scene at a beach during the daytime. A character stands on a brown, L-shaped wooden pier that extends over a large body of deep blue water. Situated on the pier is a small wooden building with a reddish-pink gabled roof and several signs featuring fish in different sizes, along with a board that reads \"FISH.\" The water, which has a constant rippling motion, becomes turquoise where it meets a yellow sandy beach in the upper part of the scene. A white and red fishing bobber floats and bobs in the water directly in front of the character. Several overlays are visible: a heads-up display in the top-right corner shows the date, time, and currency; a toolbar at the bottom displays various tool icons; and an energy bar with an \"E\" is in the bottom-right corner. A small box labeled \"Trash\" is in the bottom-left corner but later disappears. Temporary overlays include a yellow exclamation mark above the character that appears near the end of the video and soon disappears, followed by yellow italicized text that reads \"HIT!\" which appears in the center of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
