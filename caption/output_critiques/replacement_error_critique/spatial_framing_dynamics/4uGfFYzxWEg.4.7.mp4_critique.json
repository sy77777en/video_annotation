    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot from a high angle, three low-polygon figures are positioned in the center of the frame, seated on a white cube in the middle ground against a black background. The central figure, a man, sits on the front edge of the cube. To his left, another man sits on the left edge, and to the right and slightly behind the central figure, a woman is seated on the right edge.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features three human figures rendered in a low-polygon, geometric style, giving them a translucent and glowing appearance against a black background. The figures are all sitting on a white cube-like structure. In the center, a man sits facing forward, with his outfit appearing reddish-purple due to the lighting. To his left, another man, rendered entirely in a translucent white-blue hue, sits in profile. To the right and slightly behind the central figure, a woman sits with one leg lifted, wearing a reddish-maroon long-sleeved top.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, three low-polygon, stylized human figures are positioned in a dark, abstract space. All three figures are seated on the edge of a large, white, cube-like platform that contrasts with the featureless black background, each positioned at a different edge. One figure wears a reddish top, another a purplish shirt, and the third is rendered in a translucent, greenish-white glow. The figures have a faceted, crystalline appearance and emit a soft light, serving as the primary illumination in the scene.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
