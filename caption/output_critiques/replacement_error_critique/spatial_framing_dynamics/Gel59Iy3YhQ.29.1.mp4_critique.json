    "pre_caption": "A first-person view from inside a submersible's cockpit frames the scene, with the vehicle's interior and heads-up display occupying the foreground. Initially, the submersible is positioned looking forward into a dark, deep-sea cavern. In the middle ground, a cluster of small, glowing blue orbs is located in the center, while a long, skeletal creature and a large, rectangular structure are positioned on the right. As the submersible moves forward and descends, the skeletal creature swims from the right middle ground into the background, passing the rectangular structure, which becomes more fully visible. The vehicle moves over the initial cluster of orbs, revealing more clusters scattered deeper in the central middle ground, while dark, tendril-like growths become visible hanging from the cavern's ceiling and walls on the left. The camera maintains a forward-facing, slightly downward-tilted perspective from above the cavern floor throughout the movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a first-person perspective from the cockpit of a submersible navigating a dark, deep-sea cavern. The view is framed by the vehicle's interior, which features two glowing green screens and a heads-up display showing a depth of over 770 meters, vehicle integrity, and oxygen levels. Outside the submersible, the water has a murky, green tint. A large, serpentine, and semi-translucent creature with a visible, ribcage-like skeletal structure swims on the right side of the scene. It passes by a large, rectangular, and segmented alien-like structure that has glowing green rectangular lights along its side. The cavern is also filled with clusters of small, glowing blue orbs, dark, tendril-like growths hanging from the rocky edge of the cave, and schools of small, indistinct fish swimming in both the middle ground and the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, shows a descent into a dark, deep-sea cavern. The view is framed by the interior of a submersible, moving forward through transparent water that appears green due to the lighting, filled with particulate matter. The cavern walls are dark and rocky, with a patch of yellowish-green, brush-like flora visible on the left. In the distance, clusters of small, glowing blue orbs are scattered throughout the water. As the vehicle moves deeper, a long, skeletal creature swims past a large, dark, rectangular structure with glowing green lights on the right. Overlaying the scene is a heads-up display, with a compass and depth meter at the top center showing a depth increasing from 773m. On the left, an overlay indicates O2 levels, while on the right, another shows vehicle health, power, and the internal temperature. Additional icons and an \"Exit\" prompt are visible at the bottom of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
