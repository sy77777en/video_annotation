    "pre_caption": "This is a static, high-angle medium shot. A white desk extends from the foreground into the middle ground, occupying the lower half of the frame. On the desk's surface, a vintage telephone is positioned in the middle ground on the right, while a rectangular device sits in the middle ground on the left. Behind the desk, the lower portion of a stylized humanoid figure is visible, seated in a chair in the center of the frame, also in the middle ground. The entire scene is set against a solid red background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stylized, low-poly humanoid figure with a white, crystalline-like surface sits in a matching white chair behind a white desk. On the surface of the desk, there are two objects. To the right is a white, vintage-style landline telephone with a push-button keypad and a coiled cord connecting the handset to the base. To the left is another white, rectangular device, possibly a vintage calculator or a small printing machine. The entire scene is rendered in a monochromatic, minimalist style, with all subjects appearing in shades of white and gray.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This digital scene features a minimalist and stylized aesthetic against a red gradient background with white or gray tones. A white desk is positioned in the foreground, upon which rest two white, retro-style electronic devices: a landline telephone with a keypad and a coiled cord, and a rectangular device with a flip-up cover. Behind the desk, a white, low-poly, geometric figure sits in a matching white chair. The white objects and figure are cast in a cool, bluish light. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text \"[3,17]\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a table with a vintage telephone and a rectangular object on it. Behind the table sits a humanoid subject, with only part of their lower body visible. Most of their legs are obscured by the table.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
