    "pre_caption": "This is a third-person game perspective where the camera follows a man, shifting between a medium shot and a medium close-up of him while maintaining a wide shot of the scene. Initially, the man is in the foreground on the left, with metal shelves in the middle ground to the right. He turns, bringing pipes and electrical boxes into the center and right of the middle ground, before walking forward into a subway tunnel. The camera follows from behind as he moves down the tracks, which run from the foreground to the background down the center of the frame, flanked by graffiti-covered walls on the left and right. A shadowy figure then appears in the middle ground, centered on the tracks. The camera zooms in slightly to a medium close-up as the man, now on the left side of the frame, aims at the central figure. The figure erupts into a burst of light that fills the center of the middle ground, while the man remains in the foreground on the left. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a third-person perspective, a man with chin-length, dark, wavy hair is seen wearing a brown tweed-style blazer over a dark shirt, with a brown leather satchel slung over his shoulder. He walks through a dark, graffiti-covered subway tunnel, illuminating the path with a flashlight. Further down the tracks, several blurry, dark, humanoid figures within a light-distorted area appear. The man raises a dark revolver and aims it at the figures. The figures then erupt into a bright, colorful, pixelated burst of red, blue, and white light, resembling digital fireworks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot frames a character from the hip up, beginning in a dark, brick-walled utility room with metal shelves, pipes, and electrical boxes. The character proceeds into a dimly lit subway tunnel where the arched walls are covered in colorful graffiti. A single set of train tracks, partially covered in rubble, runs down the center of the foggy tunnel toward distant red lights. Multiple shadowy figures materialize on the tracks. As the character fires at them, an explosion occurs, resulting in a bright, multi-colored light effect. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays a heads-up display featuring a pistol icon and an ammo count of \"6/25,\" surrounded by an arc segment. Above this, a light bulb icon with a circular outline is shown. To the left, a bullet icon with concentric circle icons, the number \"2,\" and a partially filled horizontal bar are displayed. As the character shoots, the concentric circles disappear, and the right end of the horizontal bar's filling turns yellow before vanishing. Temporary overlays include a light bulb icon with a circular outline and a dynamic arrow in the bottom center, visible only in the middle of the video. Additionally, a crosshair appears in the center during the latter part of the video.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a third-person game perspective. The camera follows the character’s movement, with the shot size of them shifting between a medium shot and a medium close-up as the camera zooms in and out, while maintaining a wide shot of the scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
