    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a man in a red jersey is positioned in the center foreground, kneeling on an ice rink with the camera at his level. He holds a hockey stick that extends towards the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, another person in a yellow jersey starts on the right and skates across the frame to the left, passing behind the main subject. As the scene progresses, the main subject, who is sliding forward, turns his head to his left. The background, which includes the ice rink and arena structure with banners in the top left, moves past as the camera remains locked on the main subject, maintaining his central position and size within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a young player with light skin and dark hair, seen from an eye-level perspective on an ice rink. The player wears a red long-sleeved hockey jersey, black shorts over white long pants, and a white helmet with a clear visor. The shot begins as a medium full shot, showing the player sliding forward with bent knees while holding a black and white hockey stick with both hands, which are covered in black and red gloves featuring the white letters \"STX.\" Initially, the player looks straight ahead, then turns their head to the left. In the middle ground of the frame, another person in a yellow jersey and black pants moves across from right to left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, mounted to an object, captures the scene from a level angle on an indoor ice hockey rink. The rink features a white ice surface marked with blue lines, yellow lines, and a red mark, enclosed by boards. The high, arched ceiling is supported by a metal truss system and lined with overhead lights that illuminate the space. A person in a red jersey and white helmet is positioned in the foreground, holding a hockey stick. In the midground, another person wearing a yellow jersey skates across the ice, and banners hang from the rafters in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
