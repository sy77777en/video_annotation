    "pre_caption": "Initially, the man is positioned in the bottom-left of the frame in a medium shot, with train tracks running from the foreground at the bottom-left to the middle ground on the right. A blurry silhouette stands in the middle ground, right of center, while large white graffiti occupies the left wall. As the man walks forward, the camera follows from behind, panning left to briefly center him as he passes the graffiti, which moves into the foreground before exiting the frame. The silhouette is quickly framed out as the camera pans right, repositioning the man back to the bottom-left. He continues walking forward along the tracks, which now extend from the bottom of the frame into the background, with graffiti-covered walls flanking him on the left and right. The camera maintains its position behind him, keeping him in the foreground as he moves deeper into the tunnel. Throughout the video, subtitles and tutorial boxes appear in the bottom-center foreground, and a weapon HUD remains fixed in the bottom-right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with ear-length, dark brown hair is seen from behind, walking along a set of train tracks in a dark, graffiti-covered tunnel. He wears a brown, textured jacket and has a brown leather satchel slung over his shoulder. Throughout the video, he holds a flashlight in his left hand, casting a bright, circular beam of light ahead of him. In his right hand, he holds a black pistol. At the beginning of the video, a dark, blurry, human-shaped silhouette stands further down the tracks and is framed out as the camera perspective changes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot framing the character from the hip up follows a man walking through a dark and grimy subway tunnel. The concrete walls are covered in extensive graffiti, including large white block letters spelling \"LOST\" and other colorful, complex tags. At the beginning of the video, the train tracks extend from the lower-left corner of the frame to the middle-right, rather than running directly through the center of the tunnel. The tunnel is illuminated by the character's moving flashlight beam and distant red lights. The air is hazy, and debris is scattered along the tracks. Overlay elements are present on the screen. In the bottom right corner, a heads-up display shows weapon ammunition and other icons. At the bottom center, white subtitles and grey tutorial boxes with white text appear intermittently.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a 3D game video. The camera follows the character’s movement from behind. The shot size of the character shifts between a medium shot and a close-up shot, leaving more space for a wide shot of the scene ahead.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
