    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a person is initially positioned in the center-right of the frame, walking away from the camera in the middle ground. To the left, a dark car is parked in the foreground and middle ground. In the background, houses line the street on both the left and right, with a tall apartment building visible in the distant center. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, follows the person as they walk, maintaining their relative position in the frame. The person then extends their left arm toward the car on the left, interacting with an element in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, seen from behind, walks along a sidewalk wearing a dark hooded jacket with the hood up, dark pants, and a light-colored canvas shoulder bag. As they walk away from the camera, they reach their left hand out toward the door handle of a parked, dark gray-blue Vauxhall Astra hatchback with the license plate \"V151 GDY\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot, framing a character from the hip up, follows them as they walk along a wet sidewalk in a residential UK neighborhood on an overcast day. The street is lined with two-story, red-brick houses and low brick walls, with a taller, yellow-brick apartment building visible in the distance. A dark, wet Vauxhall Astra with a yellow license plate reading 'V151 GDY' is parked on the side of the road. The person, wearing a dark hooded jacket and carrying a light-colored shoulder bag, extends their left hand to pull the front car door handle. The scene is presented in a widescreen format with black letterbox bars at the top and bottom of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
