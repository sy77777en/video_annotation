    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a man in a suit seated in the center-left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The backs of several children are visible in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. To the man's right, a purple easel with books and a paper stands in the middle ground, while a blackboard and decorated walls form the background. The camera then zooms out to a full shot, revealing a woman seated to the right of the easel in the middle ground. This movement shifts the man more toward the left side of the frame and expands the view to include more children in the foreground and more of the classroom background. Throughout the shot, the camera remains at the subjects' eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a classroom setting, a middle-aged white man with short brown hair, wearing a dark suit, a white shirt, and a red tie, sits on a stool facing a group of children. His hands are clasped in front of him. To his left, on the right side of the frame, a Black woman with glasses and dark hair, wearing a dark jacket, is seated, looking at the white man. The audience consists of several young, elementary school-aged children, mostly Black, who are seen from the back as they sit in chairs. One child in the foreground has their hair in braids and is wearing a white shirt. A purple easel is positioned between the white man and the Black woman, displaying a white paper with text and two identical, colorful children's books. The background includes a blackboard and walls adorned with educational posters.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a classroom, where a man in a dark suit and red tie is seated on a stool, facing a group of children in the foreground. The background features a dark chalkboard decorated with various items, including a small, framed slate that reads \"Reading Makes a Country Great,\" a picture of a person on a bicycle, and other colorful papers. To the right, a wall displays an alphabet chart and a yellow poster with photos. A purple easel stands in the middle of the room, holding a white paper with text and two identical books with illustrated covers. As the camera zooms out, a woman seated next to the easel comes into view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
