    "pre_caption": "The scene is captured in a medium full shot with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. A man in a grey shirt occupies the left foreground, facing a man in a blue shirt who is in the right foreground. Between them, two other men are positioned in the middle ground, one at the center-left and one in the center. The background consists of dense green trees. The man on the left passes a red water balloon across the foreground to the man on the right, who holds a knife. As this happens, the two men in the middle ground throw an orange and a purple balloon upwards in the center of the frame. The red balloon is popped by the knife in the right foreground, creating a splash of water, while the other two balloons continue to ascend toward the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features four light-skinned men outdoors. On the far left, a man with dark curly hair and a full dark beard, wearing a light grey t-shirt and black shorts, initially holds a red water balloon. To his left, a man with short brown hair and glasses, dressed in a white t-shirt and dark shorts with a light-colored logo, holds a purple water balloon. In the middle, a man with dark hair and a full dark beard, wearing a white t-shirt with a dark graphic print and grey shorts with red accents, initially holds an orange water balloon and then throws it into the air. On the far right, a man wearing a red baseball cap backward, a blue t-shirt with a graphic, and dark shorts, holds a knife with both hands. The red water balloon is thrown by the first man, and the man with the cap pops it, causing water to spray.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a paved area, under a bright sky with a dense backdrop of green trees. Four men are present. Colorful water balloons—red, purple, and orange—are visible. One man, holding a knife, is positioned to interact with a red water balloon that is thrown towards him. Other balloons are tossed into the air, and the red balloon bursts, creating a visible splash of water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
