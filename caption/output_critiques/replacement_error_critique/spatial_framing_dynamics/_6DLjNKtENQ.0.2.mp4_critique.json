    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a man in a military uniform positioned in the center foreground. In the middle ground to the left, other personnel are visible, while a large map screen occupies the background on the right. The man then turns and walks toward the left, moving from the foreground into the middle ground. As he moves, the camera pans left to follow, causing the framing to transition into a medium shot that reveals more of the surrounding room and other people. The camera remains positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man with a short, buzzed haircut is featured in a dimly lit setting. He is wearing a camouflage military uniform with a circular black armband on his left sleeve and a prominent shoulder patch with a yellow outline on his right shoulder. Initially, his body is facing forward while his face is turned to his right, with his mouth slightly open but not speaking. He then turns his head to face forward and begins walking to the left side of the frame. The camera pans left with him, revealing his back. Other individuals, appearing to be military personnel in similar uniforms, are present in both the midground and background, mostly out of focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a dimly lit, modern command center. The dark room is illuminated by long, rectangular light fixtures recessed into the ceiling and the glow from various screens. In the background, a large, wall-mounted screen displays a map with blue and white graphics. Several other people, some in military attire, are scattered throughout the room, working at consoles. A man in a camouflage uniform stands in the foreground before turning and walking away from the camera, moving deeper into the active control room.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
