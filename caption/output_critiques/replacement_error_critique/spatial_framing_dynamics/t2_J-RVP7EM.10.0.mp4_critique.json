    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle perspective, the camera looks directly down into a deep, circular vortex. A bright, white light is fixed in the center of the frame, positioned in the distant background as the tunnel's endpoint. The walls of the vortex, composed of a dense mass of intertwined figures, spiral inward from the outer edges of the frame in the middle ground and recede toward the central light in the background, creating a strong sense of depth. The entire vortex structure rotates slowly in a clockwise direction, while the camera appears to move slowly forward, creating the illusion of traveling down the tunnel toward the light. The scene is framed by darkness at the extreme edges, which forms a vignette around the central vortex.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases an abstract, monochromatic animated scene featuring a deep, circular vortex viewed from above, as if looking down a tunnel. The vortex visually rotates in a clockwise direction, drawing the viewer's attention inward toward a brilliant, white, circular light at its center. The walls of the tunnel are composed of a dense, swirling mass of countless greyish-white, sculpted figures. These figures, which are ambiguous but resemble winged humanoids or angels, are intricately intertwined and layered, creating a complex, textured surface that recedes into the distance toward the central light. The outer edges of the vortex fade into complete darkness, creating a strong vignette effect that draws the eye toward the illuminated center.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This scene presents a slow, backward-moving perspective out of a dark, circular tunnel or vortex. The walls of this tunnel are intricately formed from a dense, chaotic mass of countless, intertwined, gray, sculpted figures that appear to be angelic or humanoid. At the distant center of this vortex, a bright, white light shines, illuminating the textured inner surfaces. The vortex appears to rotate clockwise, which is due to the camera's counterclockwise roll. The overall color scheme is monochromatic, consisting of shades of gray and black that contrast with the central light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
