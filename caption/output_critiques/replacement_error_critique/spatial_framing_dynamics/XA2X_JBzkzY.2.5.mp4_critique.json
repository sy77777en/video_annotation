    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up shot of a young man in the center foreground, sitting on the ground. To the left of the frame, a man is seated in a chair in the middle ground, and to the right, a woman is also seated in a chair in the middle ground. The camera then zooms out to a full shot, which reframes the three initial subjects in the bottom center. This transition reveals a large crowd of people seated in rows behind them, filling the middle ground and background of the outdoor, grassy scene. The camera remains positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, fair-skinned man with reddish-blond, shoulder-length curled hair sits on the ground, looking forward with a somber expression. He is dressed in a white shirt with a high collar and ruffled lace decoration. To his left, a fair-skinned woman sits in an ornate chair, her right hand resting on his shoulder. She has dark hair styled under a large, feathered hat and wears a low-cut, light-colored gown with a pearl necklace and bracelet. To the young man's right, another fair-skinned man sits in a similar chair, initially expressionless but eventually breaking into a smile. He wears a brown coat, a white ruffled shirt, white stockings, and a brown hat. As the view widens, a large crowd of men, women, and children, all in 18th-century aristocratic attire, is revealed sitting behind them, watching an event off-screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This scene takes place during the daytime in a sunlit, outdoor setting, likely a park or garden, where a large audience is gathered for a performance. The spectators are dressed in elaborate 18th-century attire, with men in coats and breeches and women in corseted gowns, many wearing hats. They are seated in rows of ornate, upholstered chairs with carved wooden frames placed on the grass. In the foreground, a young man with reddish-blond, styled hair sits on the ground, leaning against a chair occupied by a woman in a greyish-blue dress. As the view zooms out, it reveals a larger crowd of men, women, and children, all attentively watching an event happening just out of view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
