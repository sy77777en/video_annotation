    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot presented as an extreme wide shot. The entire scene is framed by a black binocular vignette in the foreground, creating two circular viewing ports. Through these ports, a vast, arid, mountainous landscape is visible in the middle ground and background. The camera, positioned at a high vantage point, executes a rapid pan from left to right. This swift movement causes the details of the dusty slopes and rocky terrain to blur and sweep across the frame from right to left, conveying a sense of quick surveillance across the expansive environment. A rocky outcrop is briefly visible in the bottom-right middle ground at the start of the pan.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot, beginning with a view of a structure resembling a lighthouse emitting a white light beam from its top, situated on a dark, rocky area. The structure quickly moves out of frame as the camera pans, presenting a rapid, panning view of an arid, mountainous terrain as seen through a pair of binoculars. The dusty, brown slopes and rocky outcrops are blurred by the swift movement, framed by the characteristic double-circle vignette of the optics. There is no main subject because the focus is on the act of surveillance and the vast, empty scale of the environment, emphasizing a sense of searching or reconnaissance over a specific point of interest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, pans smoothly across a vast, arid landscape during the day. The rugged, mountainous terrain is composed of dusty, brown slopes under a pale blue sky. The entire scene is framed by a black overlay that mimics the view through a pair of binoculars, creating a dark, circular vignette around the moving scenery.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
