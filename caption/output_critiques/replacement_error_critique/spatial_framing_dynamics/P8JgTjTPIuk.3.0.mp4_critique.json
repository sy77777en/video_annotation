    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, two figures are framed from behind in the foreground, with a man on the bottom left and a woman on the bottom right. They stand on a stone platform that occupies the lower portion of the frame. In the center middle ground, positioned between the two figures, is the head of a large, white wolf-like creature. Further in the background, a large, ruined structure is silhouetted in the center against a swirling green sky that fills the top of the frame. The two figures walk forward, moving from the foreground deeper into the scene toward the wolf, while the camera follows them from behind at their level, maintaining a consistent distance and framing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man and a woman are shown from behind as they walk forward. The man on the left has short dark hair and a muscular build, and he wears dark, armored attire with a weapon strapped to his back. A bright, fluorescent green glow emanates from an object hanging at his waist. The woman to his right has long, dark hair and is dressed in a long, dark, tattered-looking garment. Between them in the background, the head of a massive, white-furred, wolf-like creature is visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot framing the character from the hip up shows two figures walking on a stone platform in an outdoor environment dominated by towering, jagged ruins silhouetted against a glowing, cloudy green sky. The setting is dark and atmospheric, with swirling mist and dramatic lighting casting shadows across the scene. The stone platform beneath the characters is rough and weathered, with visible cracks and uneven surfaces. In the distance, the outline of a giant spiky building is visible, and in front of it, a giant white-furred, wolf-like creature adds to the sense of scale and mystery. The overall color palette is muted, with shades of green, gray, and black, and there are no overlay elements such as text or icons present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
