    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide, high-angle aerial shot of a cityscape. The iconic Tower Bridge is positioned in the foreground, spanning the lower half of the frame from the bottom left to the bottom right. The River Thames flows from the bottom of the frame up towards the top right, occupying the center and right portions of the scene. In the middle ground, the dome-shaped City Hall is visible to the left of the center, while a naval ship is moored on the river to the right of the center. The dense city skyline fills the background across the top of the frame. Superimposed over the river in the center of the frame are the words \"EAST\" on the left and \"WEST\" on the right, separated by a dashed line that extends vertically through the middle ground. The camera remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an expansive cityscape scenery shot, presenting a hazy, golden-hour aerial view of London. The frame is dominated by the iconic Tower Bridge in the foreground, spanning the wide, reflective surface of the River Thames. In the midground, the distinctive shape of City Hall is visible, while a dense collection of modern and historic buildings extends from the foreground to the background, fading into the misty horizon. The words \"EAST\" and \"WEST\" are superimposed in large white text over the water, bisected by a dashed line that follows the river's course, reinforcing the geographical division. There is no main subject, as the focus is on establishing the vast scale and atmospheric mood of the urban landscape rather than highlighting a specific person or object. The high-angle perspective and wide view serve to capture the environment itself as the point of interest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an aerial view of London during a hazy late afternoon or early morning. The iconic Tower Bridge, with its two stone towers, spans the brown waters of the River Thames in the foreground, where the low sun creates a golden reflection. On the riverbank, the modern, dome-shaped City Hall is visible, while a grey naval ship is moored further upstream. The background features the dense London cityscape with its mix of architecture, including several prominent skyscrapers. Overlaying the scene is a white dashed line that follows the river's course, with the words \"EAST\" on its left and \"WEST\" on its right in large, white text.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
