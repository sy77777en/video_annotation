    "pre_caption": "The video starts as a close-up shot of a woman, who is centered in the frame and occupies the middle ground. In the immediate foreground, a blurry object is positioned at the bottom center, while large windows and a circular light are visible in the background. The object is raised toward the center of the frame as the focus gradually shifts from the woman in the middle ground to the object in the foreground. This transition makes the object the new primary subject, now in sharp focus in the foreground center, while the woman becomes a blurred element in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout this sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially focuses on a woman with light skin and long, reddish-brown hair styled half-up. She has defined eyebrows, winged eyeliner, and is wearing a brown ribbed sweater over a thin, gold-toned metal choker necklace. The woman raises a pair of tweezers toward the camera, holding a small, leaf-shaped metallic object. The focus then gradually shifts from her face to the object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene is set in a dimly lit room during the evening. The background, which becomes increasingly blurred, contains large, dark-framed windows with multiple panes and a single, warm, circular bokeh light on the right. The overall lighting has a cool blue tone, contrasting with the warmer light on a woman with reddish-brown hair who is centered in the shot. As the focus transitions, a thin, blurry, greenish-gold object in the immediate foreground becomes more prominent, partially obscuring the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
