    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide underwater shot, featuring a sea turtle in the middle ground on the right, swimming towards the left over a rocky seabed that occupies the bottom of the frame. The camera, initially positioned above the turtle, rapidly ascends and breaks the surface. The view then transitions to a wide shot at water level, where an outrigger canoe is located in the middle ground on the left. The rippling water fills the foreground, while a large mountainous island sits in the background across the center and left, and a distant coastline is visible on the far right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins underwater, focusing on a large sea turtle with a mottled brown and green oval shell swimming near a rocky seabed. The turtle is oriented toward the left, using its flippers to navigate through the murky blue-green water. The scene transitions as the camera rapidly ascends and breaches the water's surface, shifting the focus from the marine life to the sea surface above. Once above the water, a small white boat with an open top becomes the primary subject, floating in the middle distance on calm blue waves. Several passengers are seated within the vessel, though their specific features are indistinct due to distance. Behind the boat, a massive, sloping mountain rises into a bright blue sky scattered with white clouds, anchoring the background of the seascape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene transitions from an underwater perspective to the surface of the ocean on a bright, sunny day. Initially, a sea turtle is seen swimming over a rocky, algae-covered seabed in murky, greenish-blue water. The view then breaks the surface, revealing a long, white outrigger canoe with several people paddling across the rippling blue water. In the background, a large, mountainous island sits under a blue sky with scattered, fluffy white clouds, and a portion of the coastline with trees is visible in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned above the subject when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
