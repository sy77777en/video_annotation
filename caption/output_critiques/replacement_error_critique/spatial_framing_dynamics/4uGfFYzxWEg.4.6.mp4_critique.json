    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot, captured from a high angle above the subjects. In the center of the frame and the middle ground, a man and a woman are positioned at a desk on a brightly lit, light-blue plane that floats in a black void. The man is seated in an office chair to the left of the desk, while the woman stands behind him to the right. A computer monitor sits on the desk in front of the man. The entire composition remains fixed throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a stylized, low-poly animation, a man with white hair wearing a purple and blue patterned shirt sits in a black office chair. He is positioned at a dark-colored desk, facing an old-style CRT computer monitor. Standing beside the desk and looking toward the computer is a woman, also with white hair, who is wearing a short-sleeved red dress. The desk has a set of drawers on the right side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a minimalist, abstract space, featuring a brightly lit, light-blue plane floating within a black void. A cool, overhead light illuminates the area, casting long, dark shadows. Positioned in the center of this plane is a dark office desk with an old-style CRT computer monitor and a black office chair. The entire scene, including two low-poly figures—one seated at the desk and another standing behind—is rendered in a distinct, geometric style. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays a white closed captioning icon with the label \"[6]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
