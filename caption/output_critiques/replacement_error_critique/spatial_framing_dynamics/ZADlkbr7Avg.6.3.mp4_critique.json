    "pre_caption": "A full, static shot from a high-angle perspective looks down on a single, square photograph positioned in the center of the frame. The photograph, the primary foreground element, rests at a slight angle on a surface of light-colored wooden planks that extend across the entire background. In the bottom left foreground, the white text \"Kikutake\" is overlaid on the scene. The camera remains stationary throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A single, square, black-and-white photograph with a white border rests at an angle on a surface of light-colored wooden planks. The photograph shows a close-up of an older man of East Asian descent with dark hair and glasses. He is dressed in a dark suit jacket over a white collared shirt and a bow tie. His eyes appear to be closed or looking downward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, with a downward view of a light-colored wooden plank surface. A single, square, black-and-white photograph with a white border lies on it. The portrait shows an older East Asian man with glasses and dark hair, dressed in a dark jacket. The environment is dimly lit by a warm, soft light. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the word \"Kikutake\" in white text.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
