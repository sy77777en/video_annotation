    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a car wheel is consistently held in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Initially, a concrete surface is positioned at the bottom of the frame with a building's siding at the top, both in the background. The camera, positioned at the wheel's level, performs a complete 360-degree rotation. As it rotates, the wheel remains stationary in the center while the background elements spin around it, with the concrete surface moving from the bottom to the right, top, and left sides of the frame before returning to its starting position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A car wheel is shown, consisting of a black rubber tire mounted on a silver-colored hubcap. The hubcap features a multi-spoke design with numerous thin, vertical slots radiating from a solid central disc. In the middle of this disc is a smaller, circular cap, also silver, which has an emblem resembling the shape of an eye at its center.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting during the day, a single black car tire with a silver, multi-spoke hubcap rolls along a concrete surface. The camera rotates in sync with the tire, keeping it centered as the background, which includes the light-colored horizontal siding and wooden trim of a building, spins around it. The scene is illuminated by diffuse, even light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
