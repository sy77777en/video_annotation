    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot. The video presents a static, extreme wide shot of an urban waterway from a high-angle perspective. A calm river or canal fills the foreground and middle ground of the frame. A small boat is positioned in the bottom-left foreground. Several other boats are scattered across the middle ground, primarily in the center. In the background, a hazy city skyline with buildings stretches across the top of the frame, with a more distinct multi-story building visible on the left. The camera remains stationary throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases a historical, black-and-white cityscape overlooking a calm urban waterway. The wide, distant view includes a port or river with several boats, though only the boat in the foreground shows minor movement. The scene features a range of vessels, from small ones in the foreground to larger barges further back, but they are not clearly visible due to blurring and low resolution. In the background, the faint outlines of multi-story buildings and industrial structures define the city's skyline through the fog. The camera's broad perspective establishes a sense of place and scale, focusing on the overall atmosphere of the waterfront environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This grainy, black-and-white historical video shows an outdoor urban waterway on a hazy or overcast day. A wide, calm river or canal fills the scene, populated by several dark, simple boats. In the blurry background, a city skyline is visible, featuring a multi-story building on the left and other indistinct structures stretching across the horizon. One small boat is positioned in the lower-left foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
