    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a woman sleeping in a bed, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. To her right, in the middle ground, are white pillows, with a striped pillow further to the right. In the background, a lamp is visible to the right of center, and a window is on the left. The camera, positioned at the woman's level, slowly pushes in, transitioning to a medium close-up shot that focuses on her head and shoulders, which remain centered in the frame. In this final framing, the background elements become less prominent as the woman occupies more of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit room, a woman with platinum blonde hair is sleeping in a bed. She is lying on her left side, her head on a white pillow, and is covered by a white blanket. She is wearing a dark-colored watch or wristband on her left wrist. As she sleeps, she talks and murmurs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit bedroom, a person with blonde hair sleeps on their side in a bed with white sheets. The room, with its blue walls, is illuminated by a soft glow coming from outside the window in the background. A striped pillow in yellow and pink rests beside the white ones. As the person talks in their sleep, the camera smoothly moves forward and remains still in the last few seconds, focused on the bed.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
