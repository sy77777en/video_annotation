    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with an extreme wide shot of a futuristic cityscape, framed by a massive, angular building in the left foreground and a towering digital billboard in the right middle ground. A \"PAN AM\" logo is visible in the top-left background, with an \"OFF\" sign in the center middle ground. A dark, futuristic vehicle is initially positioned in the center middle ground, and it proceeds to fly forward and toward the right side of the frame, moving closer to the camera. As the vehicle approaches, the framing transitions to a wide shot. The camera remains positioned at the vehicle's level throughout its movement across the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark, futuristic vehicle with a blocky, angular design and glowing lights flies through a dense, nocturnal cityscape. The urban environment is characterized by towering, dark skyscrapers, many of which are speckled with illuminated windows. To the right, a massive vertical digital billboard, composed of visible pixels, displays the animated face of a woman with dark hair, a yellow flower accessory, and red lipstick. In the upper left, a building is marked with a large, glowing blue circular \"PAN AM\" logo. Centrally located, a luminous rectangular sign with rounded corners on a building alternates the word \"OFF\" between yellow and white, adding a dynamic visual element to the scene. The building in the left foreground is a dark, massive structure with a distinctive angular roof.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a vast, futuristic cityscape at night. The outdoor scene is set between towering, dark skyscrapers dotted with small, illuminated windows. The air is hazy and filled with a light mist, and what appears to be light rain falls through the scene. On the right, a massive, building-sized digital billboard displays the pixelated face of a woman with a yellow flower in her hair and red lipstick. In the background, a blue circular \"PAN AM\" logo and an \"OFF WORLD\" sign that alternates between yellow and white colors glow amidst the structures. A dark, sleek flying vehicle with lights travels through the air, moving forward from the midground toward the right side of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
