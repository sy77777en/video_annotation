    "pre_caption": "The video is captured in a close-up from a bird's-eye perspective, with the camera positioned directly above the action. Initially, a silver hand attached to a black sleeve extends from the bottom center foreground, holding a yellow card in the center of the frame over a white counter in the middle ground. The yellow card is then removed, moving from the center up and out of the top of the frame. Immediately following, a blue and white badge slides into view from the top center, coming to rest in the center of the frame on the counter, while the silver hand remains in the bottom center foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a top-down perspective, a metallic, silver-colored hand, which appears to be robotic or prosthetic, is shown attached to an arm covered by a black sleeve. Initially, this hand, located at the bottom of the screen, holds a small, rectangular yellow card with black text that includes the word \"VISITOR\" and a circular logo. This card is then taken by another hand sweeping across the top of the screen. Following this action, another robotic arm above slides out a rectangular blue and white access badge onto the surface. This badge features a seal at the top, the word \"VISITOR\" in blue, the name \"Jane Smith\" printed below it, and a barcode at the bottom.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a scene resembling a service window, viewed from above, a metallic, silver-colored hand extending from a black sleeve interacts with a white counter positioned over a dark floor. The hand at the bottom of the screen hands out a small, yellow rectangular badge with the word \"VISITOR,\" which is then taken by another hand sweeping across the top of the screen. Subsequently, another silver hand at the top slides out a blue and white rectangular badge. The blue badge displays \"ACCESS BADGE\" above a seal, followed by \"VISITOR,\" the name \"Jane Smith,\" and a barcode at the bottom. A small overlay in the bottom left corner of the video displays white text that reads \"[3]\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video captures a close-up of the process of issuing passes at a similar administrative window from a bird's-eye angle. Initially, a hand extends from the lower part of the frame to hand over a yellow card; then, another hand reaches from the upper part of the frame, takes it, and subsequently hands over another blue card.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
