    "pre_caption": "The shot begins as a close-up, with a man's profile occupying the left foreground. The middle ground and background are initially out of focus, containing yellow and black barriers, several figures, and a distant city skyline. A rack focus then shifts the focal plane from the foreground to the middle ground, transitioning the composition to a medium shot. As a result, the man in the foreground becomes blurred, while a man in a military uniform, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, comes into sharp focus behind the barriers. Other figures are also visible in the middle ground to the right of the central figure. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout this transition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up on the side profile of a man with medium skin tone and shaggy, dyed blondish-brown hair. The focus then shifts to the midground, revealing a man of East Asian descent wearing a military-style camouflage uniform and a matching helmet. He stands behind yellow and black striped barriers. To his right, a woman with dark hair is partially visible, along with other indistinct figures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors at dusk on a paved area, with a city skyline visible in the background against a dark blue sky. In the mid-ground, yellow and black striped metal crowd control barriers are being carried by several people, including some in military uniforms. The video demonstrates a rack focus, shifting the plane of sharp focus from a person in the foreground to the mid-ground scene with the barriers and several people, while the distant buildings remain blurred. An overlay in the lower left corner features a purple-tone rectangular color block next to the white text \"RACK FOCUS,\" and another overlay in the lower right corner displays the white text \"THE HOST (2006).\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot starts with a close-up of a man, then shifts to a few people in a medium shot through a rack focus.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
