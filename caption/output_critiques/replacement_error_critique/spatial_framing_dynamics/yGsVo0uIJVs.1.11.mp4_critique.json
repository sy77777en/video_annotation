    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot captures the top portion of a submarine from a high angle, looking down. The submarine's sail is positioned in the middle ground, occupying the bottom-left and central areas of the frame, while the rest of its hull recedes into the background toward the right. Small, bright particles drift at various depths throughout the scene, from the foreground to the background, enhancing the sense of a three-dimensional underwater space. The entire composition remains static, with no camera movement or change in framing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an underwater scenery shot depicting the top portion of a large, gray submarine submerged in murky water. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of scale and mystery in the vast, quiet deep. Turquoise-blue light filters down from above, illuminating the conning tower with its various periscopes and masts, while small, bright particles drift slowly through the hazy water, enhancing the deep-sea ambiance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a murky, teal-colored underwater environment, the top portion of a gray submarine is visible. Its weathered deck and sail are submerged, with several dark, cylindrical masts and periscopes extending vertically from the structure. Light filters down from above, illuminating small, white particles drifting through the water. An overlay of white subtitles is present at the bottom-left of the screen, reading '[6]'.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
