    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a deconstructed cylindrical object located in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground against a dark background. This object is initially composed of three tiers of curved, semi-transparent panels: a solid ring at the top, a segmented ring with horizontal gaps in the middle, and another solid ring at the bottom. In the bottom-left midground, a small, static, molecule-like structure is visible on a glowing grid floor. Throughout the shot, the top and middle tiers descend vertically. Concurrently, the panels of the middle tier move horizontally to close the gaps, forming a solid ring before all tiers merge into a single, tall, cohesive cylinder that remains in the center of the frame. The camera is static and positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The central focus is a large, cylindrical object made of a frosted, reflective material that catches ambient pink and blue light. Initially, the object is deconstructed into two tiers of separate, curved panels, while the innermost tier is a solid ring. The outer tiers are divided into at least three parts both vertically and horizontally. As the video progresses, the outer tiers descend and close their gaps to cover the inner tier, forming two rings that eventually assemble into a single, tall, cohesive cylinder. The outer tier becomes seamless vertically but retains some horizontal gaps at the end. In the lower-left midground, a small, static, molecule-like structure is present, featuring interconnected light blue, pink, and green sticks with small green, pink, and light blue spheres attached.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, abstract setting with a glowing grid of green and pink lines on the floor, a central structure is composed of stacked, curved, semi-transparent panels. These reflective, frosted panels move horizontally to assemble into a single cylinder, retaining horizontal gaps at the end of the video. Reflections of pink and blue light play across the metallic surface of the structure. To the left on the grid floor, a small, colorful object resembling a molecular model with pink, green, and blue spheres is visible. The video includes an overlay element in the bottom-left corner displaying \"[21]\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a scene with a black background. Initially, it features a transparent object divided into multiple parts. As the video progresses, the pieces gradually come together, forming a cylinder object that appears to be nearly complete.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
