    "pre_caption": "The shot begins with the lower bodies and feet of two people positioned in the top center of the frame, standing in the middle ground on a sandy surface. The foreground is occupied by the sand, which features small reflective puddles in the bottom left and bottom right corners. A soft-focus pastel landscape is visible in the background at the very top of the frame. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning from this initial view to a medium full shot that reveals the subjects' bodies while keeping them centered. Throughout the shot, the camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins by focusing on the lower bodies of two women standing close together. The woman on the left wears black wide-leg trousers and white closed-toe flat shoes. As the camera transitions to their upper bodies, she is seen facing the camera directly, with dark hair falling naturally to her shoulders in slight curls. She wears a deep V-neck top cinched at the waist, adorned with a striking green decorative necklace and a white earring in her left ear. The woman on the right, shown with her back to the camera, has short, voluminous curls. She is dressed in a long black dress with a side slit and tassel embellishments on the arms, paired with white strappy gladiator-style sandals that wrap elegantly around her instep and ankle. Both women have darker skin tones.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting resembling a desert, the lower halves of two people are visible as they stand on a light beige, sandy surface. The background features softly visible mountain forms with pastel tones of pink and purple in the sky. The person on the left wears wide-leg black trousers and white, square-toed shoes. The person on the right wears a black, mid-calf skirt with a side slit and white, strappy gladiator-style sandals. Reflective water surfaces, light in color, are scattered on the sand, including a large area in the lower left corner reflecting the sky and the model's figure. Uneven footprints are also visible on the sand.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera begins by capturing the footsteps of two people at the top of the frame, along with the reflection of their upper bodies in a mirror at the bottom. It then tilts up to reveal their bodies, ending with a medium full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
