    "pre_caption": "This static extreme wide shot is framed from a top-down perspective. A large, cross-shaped wooden platform occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground, situated over a body of dark water. A pixelated character stands on the upper-left section of this platform. Positioned at the top of the platform are rows of green chests, while various crafting stations are clustered near the character. A blue bed is located in the platform's center, and a single grey chest sits at its bottom edge. The entire structure is surrounded by reddish-brown cave terrain visible at the edges of the frame. In the foreground, UI elements are overlaid on the scene, with a mini-map in the top-right corner, status bars in the top-left, and a hotbar across the bottom.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pixelated character with red hair, a red top, dark pants, blue shoes, and a brown hat stands on a wooden platform surrounded by an organized collection of objects. Along the top edge of the platform are two rows of identical green chests. In the center, there are several other containers, including a wooden chest, a stone-like chest, and a metallic chest, as well as a blue bed. Next to the character are various crafting stations, such as a grey anvil, a furnace, and several workbenches. The platform is illuminated by numerous lit torches placed on posts around its perimeter.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides, displays a pixel art scene within a dark cave. A large, cross-shaped wooden platform is constructed over a body of dark water, surrounded by reddish-brown dirt terrain with patches of green. The area is illuminated by the warm, flickering light of many torches placed around the platform's perimeter and on the adjacent land. The platform is organized with a single row of green chests at the top, a central area containing tools like an iron pot and a stove, along with crafting stations and a bed. A single character stands near the crafting area. Overlays are visible on the screen, including health and stamina bars in the top-left, a mini-map in the top-right, a hotbar with item icons and numbers at the bottom, and controller prompts in the bottom-right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
