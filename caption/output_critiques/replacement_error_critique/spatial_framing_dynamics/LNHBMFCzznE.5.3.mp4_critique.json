    "pre_caption": "A medium full shot frames a woman standing in the center-left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. In the background, a tall, vertically slatted structure is visible on the left, while a wall of stacked cylinders occupies the bottom right. The camera remains static throughout the shot, positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged white woman with shoulder-length brown hair stands at the center of the stage, slightly to the left, while speaking. She is wearing a dark gray, sleeveless, V-neck dress that falls to her knees. A small necklace is visible around her neck, and a microphone is positioned at her chin, close to her mouth. Her body is facing the right side of the frame, with her hands raised in front of her as she gestures while talking. Her mouth is continuously opening and closing as she speaks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A woman in a dark, sleeveless dress stands on a stage, set against a black backdrop. The stage is dramatically lit, with two distinct background elements illuminated in blue. To the left side of the frame, a tall, vertically slatted structure glows, with the number \"1733\" visible at its base. In the bottom right quadrant of the frame, a wall is constructed from the ends of numerous stacked cylinders, creating a textured, geometric pattern also bathed in blue light. The speaker is positioned center-left, gesturing as she talks.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
