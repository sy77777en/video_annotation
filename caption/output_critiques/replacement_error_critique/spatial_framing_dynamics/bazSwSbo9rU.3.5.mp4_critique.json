    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot filmed from a high angle, a man is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. Initially, he is bent over with his back mostly to the camera, his hand touching the dark ground. He then raises his torso and turns his head to look directly up at the camera, remaining in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The surrounding space is dark and indistinct, with the man occupying the only clearly lit area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a brown complexion and short, dark hair is shown in a low, crouching position. He is wearing a dark, disheveled suit jacket. There is a visible cut or bloodstain on his face, near his eye. He is initially bent over with both hands on the ground, then looks up toward the viewer with wide eyes and a fierce, aggressive look.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark and poorly lit space, a man in a dark coat crouches on a flat, dark surface. The ground has a slight sheen, and the overall color palette is a desaturated, murky green-grey. The scene is illuminated by a single, directional light source from above and in front, which casts deep shadows and leaves the surrounding area in near-total blackness, obscuring any background details.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
