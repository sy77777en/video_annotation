    "pre_caption": "In this wide shot, a person is initially positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, hanging upside down from a large boulder located at the top center. The background sky fills the bottom half of the frame, while the rocky ground is visible at the top edge. The camera, positioned below the subject, rotates counterclockwise, causing the entire scene to shift clockwise. As a result, the person and boulder move from the top and center towards the right side of the frame. By the end of the shot, the person is in the center-left, oriented sideways, standing on the boulder which now occupies the right side of the frame, with the sky to the left and the ground to the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with a light skin tone, wearing a bright orange short-sleeve top and shorts, is shown in various orientations relative to a large, dark grey boulder. At one point, the person appears to be hanging upside down by their feet from the underside of the boulder. At another point, they are seen standing upright on top of the same boulder. As the camera rotates counterclockwise, the entire scene, including the person and the boulder, appears to rotate clockwise.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting under a vast, cloudy sky with soft, low light, a person in a bright orange outfit consisting of short sleeves and shorts is positioned on a large, dark, rounded boulder. The location is a wide, flat expanse of rocky ground with patches resembling stagnant water. The entire scene continuously rotates, shifting the orientation of the landscape and sky, making the person and the boulder appear to be sideways or upside down relative to the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
