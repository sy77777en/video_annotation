    "pre_caption": "The shot begins as a completely blurred medium close-up, which then racks focus to reveal a young boy positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground. To his right, a large tree trunk occupies the middle ground. A green field extends from the foreground to the middle ground, with a hazy body of water and sky visible in the background on the left. As the focus sharpens, the boy turns his head slightly toward the center and raises his hand. The camera remains stationary at the boy's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young boy with brown skin and vibrant, short blue hair appears with a look of surprise. He is wearing a light blue, short-sleeved collared shirt and has black on-ear headphones with a thin metal band over his head and a black cord hanging down. His dark eyes are wide, and his mouth is slightly agape as he looks forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting at either dawn or dusk, a scene unfolds in a lush green field. A large, dark tree trunk occupies the right side of the view, with a hazy body of water visible in the distant background under a pale sky. A young boy with vibrant blue hair, wearing black headphones and a light blue shirt, is positioned near the tree. The camera transitions from a completely out-of-focus state to a sharp focus on the boy in the foreground, effectively drawing attention to him within the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
