    "pre_caption": "In a static medium shot, a person in a costume is positioned in the center foreground and middle ground. They hold a sled that occupies the bottom left foreground. A snowboard is strapped to their back, extending horizontally from the center to the right side of the frame in the middle ground. The surrounding snowy landscape fills the frame, stretching into the background where mountain peaks are visible, with a prominent one on the right. The sun is located in the top center background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, viewed from a close-up perspective, is wearing a full-body, white, furry costume that resembles a yeti. The costume's mask features two curved, cream-colored horns, an open mouth revealing sharp, yellowish teeth and pink gums, and a black nose. The person wears large, yellow-lensed ski goggles over the mask's eyes. They have a black backpack on, with a black and red snowboard strapped horizontally across it. With a gloved hand, the person holds the front of another snowboard that is black with gold-colored graphics.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a vast, snow-covered mountain range under a bright, hazy sun. The expansive, white landscape stretches towards distant, jagged peaks in the background. A person is centered in the shot, dressed in a white, furry monster costume complete with beige horns and a mask with an open, fanged mouth. They wear large, orange-lensed ski goggles over the mask and carry a black backpack, to which a snowboard with a red tip is attached. The person is holding a sled with a yellow and black board and is descending the slope.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
