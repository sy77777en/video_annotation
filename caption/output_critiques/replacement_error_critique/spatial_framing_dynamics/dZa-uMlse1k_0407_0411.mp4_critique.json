    "pre_caption": "This wide shot begins from an underwater perspective, with a black spearfishing pole positioned in the center foreground, extending vertically from the bottom of the frame. A fish is impaled on the pole in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The entire assembly, including the camera, moves vertically upwards, breaking the water's surface. The shot transitions to an above-water view, where the pole remains in the center foreground, holding the fish in the center of the frame, now elevated in the air. The water surface occupies the lower half of the frame in the middle ground, with a low landmass visible across the background at the horizon. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the transition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, silvery-white fish with dark vertical stripes and bright yellow fins is impaled on the tip of a long, black spearfishing pole. The video shows the speared fish underwater in turquoise water and then lifted completely out of the water into the air.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, transitions from an underwater perspective to the surface of a calm sea. The scene takes place outdoors on a bright, sunny day. Below the surface, the water is turquoise and filled with fine particles suspended in it. Above water, a long, black spear is held vertically, with a silvery fish marked by dark vertical stripes and a yellow tail impaled on its tip. The clear, blue-green ocean extends to the horizon, where a low, sandy landmass is visible under a clear blue sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
