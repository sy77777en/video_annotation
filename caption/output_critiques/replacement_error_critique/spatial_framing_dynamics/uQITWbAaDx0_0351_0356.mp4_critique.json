    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a high angle, showing a man in the center-middle ground, floating above a large, dark hole on the seabed which is also in the center-middle ground. As he swims directly upwards toward the camera, the framing transitions to a medium shot. He moves from the middle ground into the foreground, breaking the water's surface. The shot concludes at the subject's level, with the man in the center-foreground and a rocky shoreline visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man is shown swimming in clear, turquoise water. He wears a black and grey wetsuit top with white text on the chest and blue swimming goggles over his eyes. The video shows him underwater, holding his breath and looking at the camera while positioned above a dark, deep hole in the seabed. He then exhales a large cloud of bubbles and swims upwards, breaking the surface of the water. Once above water, he is seen gasping for air with his mouth wide open.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene transitions from an underwater perspective to the ocean's surface during the daytime. Initially, the view is of clear, turquoise water above a sandy seabed dotted with coral. A large, dark, circular abyss dominates the ocean floor. A person wearing a wetsuit and goggles ascends from the deep hole, breaking through the water's surface. The perspective then shifts to a view at water level, showing choppy waves under a partly cloudy sky, with a rocky, vegetated shoreline visible in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
