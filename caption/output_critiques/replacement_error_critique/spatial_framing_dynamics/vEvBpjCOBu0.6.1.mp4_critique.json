    "pre_caption": "A medium shot captures rows of clear glass bottles arranged diagonally across the frame. In the foreground and middle ground, the bottles are in sharp focus, extending from the bottom left towards the upper right. A black, grooved surface runs along the bottom right of the frame in the foreground, adjacent to the first row of bottles. The subsequent rows of bottles recede into the background, becoming progressively out of focus and filling the upper and right portions of the frame, which creates a sense of depth. The camera is positioned at the level of the bottle necks, and the entire shot remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Numerous empty, clear glass bottles are arranged in neat, dense rows. The bottles stand upright with a black, grooved surface positioned alongside them, suggesting a conveyor belt in a production line. The camera focuses on the bottles in the middle ground, capturing the sharp details of their transparent necks and shoulders, while the subsequent rows recede into a soft, out-of-focus blur, emphasizing the vast quantity of identical bottles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a well-lit industrial setting, featuring rows of clear glass bottles arranged in a precise, orderly fashion on a conveyor system. The bottles are transparent, cylindrical, and have smooth surfaces with narrow necks and slightly flared rims. The background is softly blurred, emphasizing the repetitive pattern and uniformity of the bottles, while the overall environment appears clean and organized, with no visible overlays or additional elements present.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
