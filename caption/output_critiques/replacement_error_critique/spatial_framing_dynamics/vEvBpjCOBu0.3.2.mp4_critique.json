    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle medium shot, where the top of a green military cap is visible in the bottom foreground. The camera slowly pushes in and tilts down, transitioning to an eye-level perspective. As the camera moves, the figure in the green uniform shifts to occupy the right foreground, remaining out of focus. The central point of focus becomes a silver tray with a single white cup, held by a silver-skinned figure standing in the center-right middle ground. To the left, another figure in a suit is positioned in the middle ground. In the background, other static, silver-skinned figures are grouped against dark, decorated walls. Numerous out-of-focus, teardrop-shaped ornaments hang from the top of the frame, and a small watermark is fixed in the bottom-left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit, wood-paneled room, several humanoid figures with metallic, silver-colored skin are gathered. A figure, seen from behind, is wearing a green military-style uniform with a peaked cap featuring a red band. Facing him is a silver-skinned man with styled silver hair, dressed in a dark, ribbed vest over a gray shirt and a yellow tie, who is holding a silver tray with a single, small white cup. Additionally, the man on the left, positioned in the midground, has a silver beard and hair and is attired in a dark suit with a blue tie and a blue pocket square. In the background, other silver-skinned figures are grouped together, similarly dressed in dark suits.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors within a dimly lit room featuring dark, decorated walls and a patterned wooden floor. Numerous crystal, teardrop-shaped ornaments, possibly part of a chandelier, hang from the ceiling. The room is populated by static, silver-colored, mannequin-like figures dressed in dark suits, some with colored ties. In the midground, a figure in a vest and yellow tie holds a silver tray with a single white paper cup, presenting it to another figure wearing a green military-style cap with a red band. A small \"[15]\" watermark is present as an overlay in the bottom left corner.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: \"The video is set in an indoor space filled with humanoid subjects dressed in suits. The focus is on one subject wearing a green military uniform, holding a tray with a cup on it. In front of him stands another subject in formal attire. At first, only the head of the subject in the green uniform is visible at the bottom of the frame. As the camera moves, it gradually shifts focus to the cup on the tray. The upper body of the subject in green becomes faintly visible and blurred in the right foreground, while the upper body of the suited subject in front of him is also partially visible and slightly out of focus.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
