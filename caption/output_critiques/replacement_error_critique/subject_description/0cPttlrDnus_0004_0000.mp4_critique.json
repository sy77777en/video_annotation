    "pre_caption": "This is an aerial cityscape scenery shot featuring a modern, glass-walled skyscraper with a highly reflective facade that mirrors a distorted view of the surrounding urban environment. In the background, a sprawling city with numerous residential and commercial buildings stretches towards a hazy, mountainous horizon, while a digital network overlay of thin white lines and small logos is superimposed across the scene. The video lacks a singular main subject, as the focus is placed on the expansive environment to convey the scale and atmosphere of the urban landscape. The reflective building acts as a central visual element, but it serves to interact with and represent the broader cityscape rather than standing as an isolated subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
