    "pre_caption": "This is an urban scenery shot establishing a sense of place and atmosphere. The static frame captures the ground level of a stark, concrete apartment building, featuring a row of identical blue doors set against a pebbledash facade. An unkempt patch of overgrown grass and weeds separates the building from the dark asphalt pavement in the foreground, where a small, dark rat is briefly visible. The shot lacks a central subject, as its focus is on conveying the environment's overall condition of neglect and decay, using the unmaintained landscape and functional architecture to create a bleak mood.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
