    "pre_caption": "This video presents an expansive aerial cityscape scenery shot, showcasing a sprawling urban center set against a dramatic backdrop of distant, hazy mountains under a partly cloudy blue sky. The foreground is characterized by a mix of lower-rise residential buildings and abundant green trees, which gradually transition into the dense downtown core filled with numerous modern skyscrapers and high-rises. To the left, a body of water separates the foreground from the main city, with a bridge visible in the distance. There is no single main subject, as the camera's broad perspective is intended to capture the overall scale and atmosphere of the environment. The focus is on the relationship between the dense urban development and the vast natural landscape, creating a comprehensive portrait of the location rather than singling out a specific object or building.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
