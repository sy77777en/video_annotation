    "pre_caption": "This video presents a street-level cityscape scenery shot of a quiet street corner, likely during dawn or dusk under an overcast sky. The scene is defined by a crosswalk, traffic poles with yellow bands, and the front of a red SUV on the right. Lush green trees and a large, pink blossoming tree line the sidewalk and background, indicating a spring setting. There is no main subject, as the camera's wide, slightly distorted perspective is used to capture the overall environment and atmosphere of the location. The focus is on the setting itself—the interplay of urban infrastructure and natural foliage—rather than on any single person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
