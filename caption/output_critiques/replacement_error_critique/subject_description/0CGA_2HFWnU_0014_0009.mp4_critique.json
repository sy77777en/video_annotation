    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a panoramic view of a modern urban skyline set against a backdrop of distant mountains and a partly cloudy sky. Tall glass and concrete high-rises dominate the horizon, interspersed with mid-rise buildings and lush green trees in the foreground, creating a striking contrast between natural and built environments. The focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the city as it blends into the surrounding landscape, rather than on any specific object or individual, emphasizing the grandeur and expanse of the environment rather than a particular subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
