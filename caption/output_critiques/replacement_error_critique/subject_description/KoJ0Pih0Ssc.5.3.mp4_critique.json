    "pre_caption": "This video features a historical recreation scenery shot of a fortified urban border, likely the Berlin Wall's \"death strip.\" The perspective pans across the desolate, multi-layered security zone, starting with a view over brown dirt and a wide, raked strip of yellowish sand. This area is bordered by a concrete pathway and a grey wall topped with barbed wire, in front of which stands a uniform line of X-shaped, metal anti-tank obstacles. The view then shifts to follow a second, taller, and smoother grey concrete wall with a rounded top, which curves into the distance, set against a backdrop of nondescript city buildings under a clear sky. There is no main subject, as the focus is deliberately placed on the oppressive and complex environment, using the sweeping motion to convey the scale and impassibility of the entire fortified structure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
