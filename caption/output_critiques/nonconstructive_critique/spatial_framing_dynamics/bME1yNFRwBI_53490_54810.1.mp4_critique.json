    "pre_caption": "The video starts as a medium close-up with a blurry hand in the extreme foreground on the left, which then moves out of the frame. This reveals a woman in the middle ground, positioned slightly to the right of the center, with a forest and a small waterfall occupying the background on the right. The woman, initially facing the camera, turns her head to her right and looks down. She then brings a dreamcatcher stick into view from the bottom of the frame. After briefly raising her left hand on the right side of the frame, she moves the dreamcatcher into the foreground, holding it in the center of the shot towards the camera while she remains in the middle ground, looking forward. The camera is positioned at the subject's level and remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with fair skin, long, straight, dark brown hair, and light blue eyes is shown in a medium close-up view. Initially, a hand is near her face before moving away. She wears a light-colored, open-front shirt over a pink top and a necklace with a dark pendant. She looks directly at the viewer with a neutral expression, then turns her head to the side and looks down. She picks up a wooden stick adorned with light-colored beads and a small dreamcatcher. Holding the stick, she raises her other hand with an open palm before bringing the dreamcatcher portion of the stick up in front of her, holding it towards the viewer.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video opens with a blurry hand moving away from the lens, revealing a woman with long dark hair in a lush, green forest. The setting is dimly lit, featuring a small, glowing blue waterfall that cascades into a dark pool of water. The surrounding environment is dense with green foliage, including leafy bushes, long grasses, and dark, hanging vines in the background. The woman, wearing a light-colored top, picks up a wooden stick decorated with beads and a small, feathered dreamcatcher, holding it up in front of her.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
