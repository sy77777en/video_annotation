    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the scene starts underwater with a gloved hand holding a lobster positioned in the bottom right foreground, while the tip of a speargun is visible in the bottom left foreground. A dense school of fish fills the middle ground and background, occupying the upper and left portions of the frame above a rocky seabed located in the bottom center middle ground. The entire frame, along with the foreground elements, moves upward, breaking the water's surface. In the final framing, the hand and lobster remain in the bottom right foreground, partially submerged in the ocean, which now fills the middle ground. A distant, low-lying island is situated in the background, stretching horizontally across the center of the frame, with the sky occupying the top portion of the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a person's hand, wearing a blue and white patterned glove, is seen holding a spiny lobster. The lobster has a reddish-brown patterned carapace, long, thick, reddish antennae, and legs with black and white stripes. The tip of a speargun is visible on the left side of the hand, suggesting it is being held by the person's other hand. The scene is initially set underwater, where the hand and lobster are surrounded by a massive, dense school of small, silvery fish swimming near a rocky seabed. The view then transitions to the surface of the water, showing the open ocean and a low, rocky island in the distance under a blue sky with sparse white clouds.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, captures a scene that transitions from underwater to the ocean's surface on a clear, sunny day. Initially, the view is submerged in clear blue water, surrounded by a massive, swirling school of small, silvery fish above a rocky seabed. The perspective then breaks the surface, revealing a vast, choppy blue ocean under a bright blue sky with sparse white clouds. In the distance, a long, low-lying, arid island is visible on the horizon. Throughout the sequence, a blue and white patterned gloved hand holds a large spiny lobster, its patterned carapace and long, reddish antennae prominent both below and above the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
