    "pre_caption": "This is a static, medium over-the-shoulder shot. A man with blond hair is positioned in the foreground on the left, with his back to the camera. In the middle ground, a second man in a gray sweater is seated in the center-right of the frame, facing toward the left. The background consists of a dimly lit room, with shelves holding containers and glass doors visible on the right. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, fair-skinned man with short, salt-and-pepper, receding hair is seated and facing slightly toward the left side of the frame. He wears a gray quarter-zip pullover sweater over a white collared shirt and has a slight smile on his face. His hands are clasped in front of him on a surface just out of view. Opposite him, seen from the back and on the left side of the scene, is another fair-skinned man with short blond hair, wearing a dark blue long-sleeved shirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An over-the-shoulder POV, where the camera is positioned behind a character in a dark blue shirt, shows a conversation in a dimly lit indoor setting. A man wearing a grey quarter-zip pullover over a white collared shirt is seated opposite, with his hands clasped. The background is dark, illuminated by overhead fluorescent lights. In the lower right corner of the frame, glass doors are visible next to dark shelving units holding rows of small, light-colored containers. A framed picture hangs on a dark wall in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
