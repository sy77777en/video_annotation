    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a blurry figure occupying the right foreground, set against the ocean, which is in focus in the background. The shot's focus then pulls from the background to the foreground, transitioning into a close-up that reveals the figure to be a young boy. He remains positioned on the right side of the frame, shown in profile looking toward the left, while the ocean becomes a blurred background element. The camera is positioned at the boy's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This black-and-white video begins with a blurry, out-of-focus profile of a person set against the ocean. The shot slowly comes into focus to reveal a young boy in close-up. He is looking toward the left with his mouth slightly open. He wears a dark, textured cap over his dark hair, and there are a few smudges on his cheek. The collar of his dark garment appears to be ribbed.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a black and white scene, the video begins with the sea surface in sharp focus while the profile of a young boy wearing a cap appears blurry. Positioned on the right side of the frame, he initially gazes at the ocean. As the focus shifts, the sea surface becomes blurred, and the boy's facial features come into sharp focus. The boy then turns his head to the left, directing his gaze off-camera towards an area beyond the left side of the frame. In the background, gentle waves break near the shore under an overcast sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a close-up shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
