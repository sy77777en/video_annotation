    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme close-up of a large, blurred, circular object that fills the center foreground. In the out-of-focus background, a computer monitor and a chair are positioned on the right. The shot then transitions via a focus pull, shifting the plane of focus from the foreground to the middle ground. This reveals a \"Battlestar Galactica\" plaque, which settles into a close-up, positioned in the center of the frame and now in sharp focus. The background elements remain out of focus. A text box is consistently located in the bottom-left foreground, and the camera is positioned at the plaque's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A revealing shot begins with a blurry, circular, brownish object that slowly comes into focus. As the details sharpen, it is revealed to be a black, octagonal plaque featuring a gold-colored emblem. The emblem consists of a central, stylized, winged symbol resembling a phoenix, enclosed within concentric circles. The words \"BATTLESTAR GALACTICA\" are embossed in black around the upper arc of the inner circle, and \"BSG 75\" is embossed below the central symbol. A translucent text box in the lower-left corner contains white text that reads \"ALL SHOTS ON $300 CAMERA MOSTLY HANDHELD AND ALL FOCUS PULLED BY HAND\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor office setting, the camera performs a focus pull, initially capturing a sharp view of a desk with a computer monitor, a chair, and a wooden wall in the background. As the focus shifts, the background becomes blurry, bringing a black, octagonal object in the foreground into sharp focus. This object features a gold-colored, circular emblem with a stylized winged symbol at its center, inscribed with the text \"BATTLESTAR GALACTICA\" along the top and \"BSG 75\" at the bottom. A text overlay in the lower-left corner displays white text in a black box, reading: \"ALL SHOTS ON $300 CAMERA MOSTLY HANDHELD AND ALL FOCUS PULLED BY HAND\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
