    "pre_caption": "In this close-up shot, a man's face is positioned in the background, viewed through a leaded glass window in the middle ground. Initially, his face occupies the left and central portions of the frame. In the foreground, white mathematical symbols are written on the glass, with an infinity symbol located to the right of the center. The camera slowly pulls back, revealing more of the diamond-patterned window frame and additional symbols. As the shot widens, the man's face becomes more centrally framed behind the glass, while a summation symbol appears in the bottom-center foreground, a fraction in the bottom-left, and other equations on the right. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot shows a middle-aged man with graying hair, wearing large, dark-framed glasses. He is looking down and to his left with an expression of deep concentration. His face is viewed through a leaded glass window, which is covered in handwritten white markings. These markings are mathematical and scientific formulas, including a prominent infinity symbol, a summation symbol, and a fraction. The man is wearing a light-colored, possibly tan, collared garment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting, the scene is viewed through a leaded glass window with a diamond-shaped pattern. The surface of the glass is covered with hand-drawn white mathematical notations, including a prominent infinity symbol, a summation symbol, a fraction, and other partial equations. Behind the glass, a man wearing glasses is seen in close-up, his face partially obscured by the window's lead lines and the written formulas. The environment is dimly lit, creating a muted and focused atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
