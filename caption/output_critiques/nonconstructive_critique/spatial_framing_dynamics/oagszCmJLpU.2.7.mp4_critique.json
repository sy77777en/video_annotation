    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a rural landscape, focusing on a large weather system rather than a specific subject. The composition is dominated by a massive, swirling storm cloud system that occupies the top two-thirds of the frame, positioned in the middle ground and background. Below, a flat, green field fills the bottom third of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the horizon. A few small, silhouetted trees are visible in the middle ground, located in the lower right portion of the frame. In this time-lapse sequence, the entire storm formation moves from left to right across the sky, with the clouds churning and evolving. A curtain of rain can be seen descending in the middle ground on the left side of the frame, moving along with the storm. The scene is captured from a low camera angle, looking up towards the sky, which emphasizes the scale of the clouds over the land.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic time-lapse landscape scenery shot, capturing the immense power of nature. A colossal supercell storm cloud, a swirling mass of dark gray, light gray, and ethereal blue-green hues, dominates the sky as it churns and advances across the frame. Below this turbulent canopy lies a vast, vibrant green field stretching to a distant horizon where sheets of rain are visibly falling. The scene lacks a singular main subject, as the composition emphasizes the overwhelming scale and atmospheric drama of the weather phenomenon itself, dwarfing the few small, silhouetted trees positioned in the lower part of the frame, slightly to the right of the center, and drawing the viewer's focus to the raw, environmental spectacle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor, rural setting, a time-lapse captures a massive, swirling storm system moving across the sky. The clouds are a mix of dark grey and blue-green, forming complex, layered patterns as they churn above. Below, a vast, flat field of vibrant green grass extends to the horizon. In the lower part, slightly to the left of the center in the background, a curtain of rain descends from the clouds at the center of the storm. Meanwhile, the sky beneath the clouds, slightly to the right of the center, appears relatively bright. A few small, scattered trees are silhouetted against the bright part of the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

The trees are inaccurately placed in the middle ground, and their location is misidentified as the lower right portion of the frame. The curtain of rain is also incorrectly described as being in the middle ground. Furthermore, the stated proportions of the frame occupied by the clouds and the field are incorrect.",
