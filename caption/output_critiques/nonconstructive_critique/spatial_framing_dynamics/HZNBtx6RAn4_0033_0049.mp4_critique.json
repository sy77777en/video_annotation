    "pre_caption": "This is a static medium shot, filmed at the subjects' eye level, featuring two men in the foreground. The man on the left and the man on the right are positioned opposite each other at a table that occupies the center foreground. In the middle ground, brown curtains frame the scene on the right. A large window extends across the background, revealing a city street. In the background, buildings are visible across the street, with cars and pedestrians moving horizontally. While the two men remain seated, their positions fixed within the frame, they make small movements by leaning forward and gesturing with their hands over the table.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a medium shot of two men sitting face-to-face in a restaurant booth. The man on the left appears to be middle-aged, with light brown, slicked-back hair. He is wearing a dark suit jacket over a light blue collared shirt, has a watch on his left wrist, and is wearing a ring. He leans forward on the table, using hand gestures as he speaks. The man on the right appears younger, with dark, wavy hair, and is wearing a light blue suit jacket over a dark shirt, also wearing a ring. He sits across from the first man, actively gesturing as he listens. On the white-topped table between them are plates of food, a glass of orange juice, glasses of a dark beverage, and various condiments.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a diner during the daytime, viewed from a booth. Two men in suits sit opposite each other at a white-topped table, which holds plates of food, a glass of orange juice, dark beverages, and various condiments including a ketchup bottle. Behind them, a large window framed by brown curtains looks out onto a city street. Across the street, low-rise buildings are visible, one of which has a sign for \"HERO SANDWICHES.\" Cars are parked and moving along the road, and pedestrians can be seen on the sidewalk under an overcast sky.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video mainly shows a medium shot of two men sitting face-to-face in a restaurant, with some people and cars visible outside the window in the background, but they are not the main focus.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
