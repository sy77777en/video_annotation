    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot, captured from an oblique top-down perspective, initially frames a character in the upper-left quadrant, positioned in the middle ground in front of a house. In the background, an older woman stands in the top-left corner. A river flows vertically through the center of the scene. The character walks down and to the right, moving toward a stone bridge in the center of the frame. As the character crosses the bridge, the camera pans smoothly to the right, keeping the character in the center of the frame. This movement reveals a smaller wooden house in the upper-right quadrant, in the middle ground, and brings pink-blossomed trees into the bottom-right foreground. The character stops in the center of the frame, on the right side of the river. A user interface in the top-right corner and a toolbar at the bottom of the screen remain static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixelated scene, a character with gray, spiky hair, wearing a red long-sleeved shirt and dark pants, is positioned on a dirt path. To the upper left, an older woman with gray hair tied in a bun is visible, wearing a red dress. A light green, vintage-style pickup truck is parked next to a house that has a roof with alternating gray and black colors and walls that alternate between white and blue.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video featuring an oblique top-down view captures a pixel-art rural landscape. A blue river flows vertically through the scene, crossed by a stone bridge. The environment consists of green grass, sandy dirt paths, and numerous green trees and bushes, with several pink-blossomed trees becoming visible at the bottom of the frame as the character walks onto the bridge. In the upper left corner, a two-story house with alternating white and blue timbered exterior walls has a green pickup truck parked beside it. On the right side of the river, there is a smaller, single-story wooden house with a purple roof. A character with white hair walks from the larger house, across the bridge, and toward the smaller house as the camera pans to follow. An overlay in the top right corner displays a user interface showing the time changing from 1:30 PM to 1:40 PM on a sunny day, along with the date and in-game currency. A toolbar with tool icons is visible at the bottom of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
