    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an out-of-focus view, featuring a dark, blurry silhouette of a treeline positioned in the background along the bottom of the frame. A young woman enters from the bottom of the frame, moving upward into the center foreground as she comes into focus, transitioning the shot into a close-up of her head and shoulders. In the final composition, she is positioned centrally in the foreground, with the camera at her eye level. A piece of fabric on her head blows to the left side of the frame before moving down and exiting the shot. The blurry treeline remains in the background at the bottom, with a hazy sky filling the upper background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The black-and-white video begins with an out-of-focus view, from which a young woman slowly approaches the camera, entering from the lower part of the frame. Initially, her head is covered with a piece of light, thin gauze fabric. As she moves, the fabric slips off and exits the frame, revealing her full appearance. She has dark hair styled in braids pinned up around her head, dark eyes, and prominent eyebrows. Facing the camera with a neutral expression, she wears a light-colored blouse featuring a patterned collar.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a grainy, black-and-white outdoor scene, a young woman with braided hair comes into focus against a hazy, light gray sky. The background consists of a dark, out-of-focus silhouette of a treeline. The video has the texture of old film, with visible specks and dust. The woman wears a light-colored top with dark embroidery at the collar. As she approaches the camera, a piece of translucent fabric blows in the wind near her face, eventually slipping off her head and moving out of the frame from the bottom as she looks forward.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a close-up shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
