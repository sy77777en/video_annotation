    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a landscape, where the camera is positioned at a low height, close to the ground, and mounted on an object visible at the bottom center foreground of the frame. The central metal ramp extends from the bottom center foreground toward the middle ground, flanked by two shorter brown ramps on either side, both occupying the lower left and right middle ground. To the left middle ground, a wooden A-frame structure and device are visible, while a wire fence runs horizontally along the left and right background. The mountains and sky fill the upper background, with the mountains stretching across the center and right, and the sky occupying the top half of the frame. As the camera moves forward and launches off the ramp, the shot transitions to an extreme wide shot, tilting upward so that the sky dominates most of the frame, the ground recedes to the lower background, and the object the camera is mounted on remains at the bottom center foreground. The camera’s height remains low throughout, but the angle shifts from level to upward as the perspective changes from ground-level movement to an elevated, skyward view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases a dynamic landscape scenery shot, capturing a fixed point of view as it moves across a vast area of dark gray concrete and brown grassland. The terrain stretches towards a distant mountain range under a wide, blue sky filled with scattered white clouds. There is no main subject, as the focus is on conveying the sense of speed and scale within the expansive natural environment. The shot begins at a level angle and gradually transitions to a low angle, emphasizing the journey through the landscape rather than a particular object within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object, begins by looking down a long, silver, textured metal ramp situated in a dry, grassy field. The central ramp is flanked by two shorter, brown ramps. In the background, mountains are visible beneath a blue sky with white, puffy clouds. To the left, a wooden A-frame structure holds a wooden device composed of circular and rectangular shapes, and a wire fence runs along the perimeter of the field. The perspective moves forward and launches off the ramp, tilting upward to reveal a wide expanse of the sky. The white, curved surface of the object the camera is mounted on remains visible at the bottom of the view throughout the motion.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.",
