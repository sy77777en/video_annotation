    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a person on an ATV is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground. The camera, mounted at the subject's level on the rear of the vehicle, maintains a fixed position behind them as they drive forward. A herd of cattle is scattered across the middle ground, primarily in the left and central parts of the frame, moving away from the camera. In the background, distant mesas stretch across the horizon, with the sky occupying the top third of the frame. The entire scene moves forward from the camera's perspective, following the ATV's path through the grassy field.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, seen from behind, operates a black-and-grey or black-and-silver all-terrain vehicle. The individual wears a black, full-face helmet that covers their head. They are dressed in a light-colored, long-sleeved button-up shirt with western-style yokes on the shoulders, tucked into blue jeans held up by a brown leather belt. In the midground, a herd of cattle of various colors, including white, brown, and dark, is visible across a field.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot, framing a character from the hip up, follows a person wearing a black helmet and a light-colored shirt as they ride an ATV through a vast, grassy field. The outdoor setting is a landscape during the day, characterized by distant, flat-topped mesas under a pale sky with a few wispy clouds. A herd of cattle is scattered across the pasture. The scene has a distinct yellow-green color grade, and motion blur on the surrounding grass indicates the vehicle is moving forward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
