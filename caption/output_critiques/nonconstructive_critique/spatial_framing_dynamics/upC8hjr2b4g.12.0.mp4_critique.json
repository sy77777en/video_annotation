    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot of a corridor, captured from a level angle. A window with vertical bars is positioned in the foreground on the left, while the hallway itself extends into the background, creating a sense of depth. At the end of the hall, a closed door is centered in the frame, located in the background. The camera then moves steadily forward down the corridor, causing the door to grow larger in the frame. As the camera gets closer, the door, still centered, opens outward and to the right. The shot concludes as a wide view of the room seen through the open doorway. In the final framing, the open door occupies the middle ground on the right. Within the room in the background, a chair is positioned in the center, a medical cart is to its left, and a small table is to its right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video focuses on a hallway leading to a closed, light-colored door that has a narrow vertical window and a silver handle. Above the door, a red light fixture illuminates a sign displaying the number \"13\" and Chinese characters. The door then opens outward to reveal a sparsely furnished room. Inside, a simple wooden chair with a light brown finish is positioned in the center. To the right of the chair is a small, dark-colored table with a white tabletop, and to its left stands a white medical cart on wheels, which holds a monitor.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit, sterile hallway with white tiled walls and a window with vertical bars on the left. At the end of the hall, a single door with a narrow vertical window is positioned under a glowing red light fixture. A sign above the door reads \"13 号房间\". The red light casts a glow on the walls and floor. The door opens outward to reveal a sparsely furnished room, where a single wooden chair, a small table, and a medical cart with a monitor are illuminated by a single spotlight from above. A white overlay text \"[24]\" appears in the bottom left corner at the beginning of the scene and disappears by the end.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a wide shot of a corridor with a door at the end, taken from a level angle. As the camera moves forward, the door opens; finally, the frame presents a wide shot of the room through the door.",
