    "pre_caption": "The video starts as a medium close-up, with one man in focus in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. Another man is visible as a large, out-of-focus shape occupying the left foreground. The focus then shifts from the middle-ground subject to the foreground subject, transitioning the shot into a close-up of the second man, who now appears in sharp detail in the left foreground. Consequently, the first man in the center-right middle ground becomes blurred. The camera remains at the subjects' level for the duration of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially focuses on a man in the background with dark hair, a mustache, and a streak of blood on the left side of his face. He is wearing a dark, collared shirt and looks intently forward. In the foreground, another man is seen, but he is out of focus. The focus then shifts to this foreground man, revealing him in detail while the man in the background becomes blurred. The foreground man has dark, wavy hair, a full beard and mustache, and appears to be sweating. He is wearing a brown shirt and is looking down and to his left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a dimly lit, confined interior with dark, greenish-hued walls. A warm, low-key light source illuminates the space, casting deep shadows. In the background, a man with a mustache and short dark hair is visible, looking forward. Another man with a beard and mustache occupies the foreground, initially seen as a blur before the focus shifts to him, revealing his downward gaze. The scene is presented in a widescreen format, framed by black letterbox bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
