    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a man is initially centered in the foreground, seen from behind. In the middle ground, a woman stands to the left of the frame beside a smoking grill, with other people seated at a table behind her, while a clothesline with laundry hangs across the top of the frame. A propane tank occupies the bottom-left foreground, and a lawnmower is in the bottom-right foreground. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, follows the man as he walks forward, moving from the foreground deeper into the middle ground while remaining centered. As he advances, the propane tank and lawnmower move out of the frame, and the camera passes under the clothesline, bringing the group in the middle ground into closer view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man with short, dark hair, seen from behind as he walks across a grassy yard. He wears a short-sleeved t-shirt with vertical yellow, red, and dark blue stripes, along with light blue shorts. In the midground, a woman with long, dark hair, wearing a long, light-colored patterned dress, stands next to a black kettle grill from which smoke is rising. Nearby, at least two other people, including an elderly person in a yellow outfit and another person in a purple shirt, are seated at a wooden table. A small, dark-colored dog is also visible in the yard, carrying a small yellow package on its back. Overhead, various pieces of laundry, including a floral-patterned sheet and a red fringed blanket, hang on a clothesline.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot, framing a character from the calves up, follows them as they walk across a green, grassy backyard toward a small gathering. The scene is set in the late afternoon under an overcast sky, with a suburban house visible in the background behind lush trees. A clothesline with various sheets and clothing, including a floral-patterned sheet and a red fringed blanket, hangs overhead, blowing in the wind. In the distance, a few people are at a wooden table near a black kettle grill from which white smoke rises. As the camera moves, a white propane tank on concrete steps to the left and a lawnmower on the right both exit the frame. The entire scene has a grainy, film-like texture.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
