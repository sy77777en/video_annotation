    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a cardboard box positioned in the center-right of the frame, resting on a wooden floor in the foreground. A paneled wall is visible in the middle ground on the left. The camera, initially positioned at the box's level, moves vertically upward. As it ascends, the box and floor travel toward the bottom of the frame and exit the shot, with the final view showing the upper portion of the wall.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light brown, rectangular cardboard box rests on a wooden floor. The top flaps of the box are slightly ajar. On the side facing the camera, black text is printed, with the words \"VALLEY SERVICE\" visible in a larger font above smaller, less distinct text. The camera then moves smoothly upward, initially tilting slightly downward at the beginning of its ascent, causing the box to move out of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting with a distinct blue hue, a light brown cardboard box rests on a floor made of light-colored wooden planks. To the left, a paneled wall or door is visible. The box has faint text on its side, including the words \"VALLEY SERVICE,\" and its top flaps are slightly open. The camera smoothly moves upward, initially tilting slightly downward as it begins its ascent. A white overlay with the text \"[9]\" consistently remains in the bottom-left corner of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
