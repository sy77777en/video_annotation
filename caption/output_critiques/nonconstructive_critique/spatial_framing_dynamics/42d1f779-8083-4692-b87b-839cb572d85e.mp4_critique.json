    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, three people are positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground as they walk away from the camera. A person in a white shirt is slightly left of center, with their arms outstretched towards the left and right sides of the frame. To their right is a person in a blue jacket, and a third individual is partially visible in the center between them. The group is surrounded by dense foliage in the middle ground, with more plants framing the shot in the foreground. In the background, the structure of the conservatory is visible. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, follows them as they move deeper into the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a rear perspective, a person with long, dark, wavy hair, wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt, walks with their arms outstretched to their sides. To their right is a person with short, brown hair dressed in a dark blue jacket. A third individual, wearing a dark top, is partially visible walking between the other two.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot follows several people walking through a sunlit outdoor conservatory during the day. The environment is characterized by dense, lush tropical foliage, with a variety of large-leafed green plants and palm trees creating a verdant canopy. In the background, the white metal framework and glass panels of the structure are visible. The group moves away from the camera along a path that winds through the abundant greenery.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
