    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle extreme close-up, where the red back of a couch fills the foreground and most of the frame. The tops of two white, geometric figures are partially visible in the middle ground, one on the left and one on the right. As the camera slowly cranes upward, it reveals a full shot of the scene from the subjects' level. In the final composition, the two figures are shown from the waist up, sitting in the middle ground on the left and right. The couch back now occupies the bottom foreground. The upward movement also reveals a coffee table in the middle ground directly in front of the figures, and behind it, a television on a console in the center of the scene, with the wall serving as the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows two stylized, human-like figures sitting on a couch, viewed from behind. Both figures are rendered in a low-polygon, geometric style, with a uniform white, faceted surface. The figure on the left, appearing to be a man, has a blocky head shape and broad shoulders. The figure on the right, likely a woman, has a head shape that resembles a rounded short haircut. They are both sitting upright and facing forward, looking towards a television.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit living room with a stylized, low-poly aesthetic, viewed from behind a large, red-cushioned couch. As the camera gradually moves upwards, it reveals two white, geometric figures sitting on the couch, facing a vintage-style television on a wooden media console. In front of them is a light-colored wooden coffee table, placed on a light gray patterned rug. The TV screen shows a title card for \"WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?\" sponsored by \"RITZ.\" On the TV stand, to the left of the television, there is a small green plant in a gray vase, and to the left of the TV stand, there are two large potted plants. Several empty, dark picture frames are arranged on the muted green wall behind it. A text overlay in the bottom-left corner reads \"[S] : ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2001)\". Another overlay appears in the lower-left area, stating \"19 million viewers\" and \"32% of UK population (2000)\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
