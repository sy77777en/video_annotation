    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, showing a woman in the background on the right, walking toward the camera. In the foreground, a smartwatch is positioned on the bottom left, initially out of focus. As the woman moves from the background to the middle ground and exits the frame on the right, the focus shifts from the background to the foreground. The shot transitions to a close-up of the smartwatch, now in sharp focus at its bottom-left position. A hand then enters from the right side of the frame, moving toward the smartwatch in the foreground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level for both the woman and the smartwatch.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a woman with long, dark hair walking forward from a dimly lit hallway. She is wearing a loose, oversized brown t-shirt that functions as a dress, paired with dark shorts mostly covered by the t-shirt, and white sneakers. As she walks toward the camera and out of the frame, the focus shifts to a smartwatch in the foreground. The watch, which was previously blurry, is now in sharp focus, revealing its square black face and blue band as it rests on a surface. A light-skinned hand then enters the frame from the right and reaches toward the smartwatch, causing the screen to light up and display a symmetrical kaleidoscope pattern in contrasting red and blue.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a dimly lit indoor corridor, characterized by large, gray tiled walls and a dark floor. In the center of the frame, a doorway is visible, leading to a room that casts a bluish-green hue from the outside scenery, revealing the exterior buildings. A long hallway extends from the midground to the background, illuminated by warm, recessed ceiling lights. Positioned in the blurred foreground is a smartwatch with a blue band resting on a surface. A person wearing a dark, oversized t-shirt and white sneakers walks from the midground toward the foreground. After they exit the frame, a hand enters and touches the smartwatch.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
