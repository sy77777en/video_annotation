    "pre_caption": "A wide shot frames the Trevi Fountain, which is positioned centrally in the middle ground and background. In the foreground, a crowd of people occupies the bottom of the frame, standing around the fountain's edge. The fountain's illuminated turquoise basin is located in the lower-center middle ground, separating the foreground crowd from the main stone structure. The fountain's facade and statues dominate the center of the frame, extending upwards into the background. Flanking the fountain, multi-story buildings are visible in the middle ground on the left and right sides of the frame. The camera is positioned at the level of the people in the crowd, capturing the scene from a straight-on perspective. The spatial composition remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is the Trevi Fountain, a monumental Baroque fountain constructed from light-colored stone, which appears weathered. The fountain is integrated into the facade of a large building and features a central niche containing a large statue of a muscular man, Oceanus, standing on a shell-like chariot. The base of the fountain is a sprawling, rocky landscape with water cascading into a large, turquoise-colored basin that is illuminated from beneath. A crowd of people is gathered around the fountain's edge, dressed in casual, cool-weather clothing like jackets and coats. The scene is filmed with a wide-angle lens, creating a curved perspective of the surrounding buildings under a cloudy sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A wide-angle perspective captures the Trevi Fountain in Rome at dusk, exhibiting mild barrel distortion. The sky is overcast with white clouds, while the massive Baroque fountain and the surrounding buildings are illuminated by warm, artificial lights. The fountain, made of light-colored stone, is the facade of the Palazzo Poli and features a central niche with a statue of Oceanus, flanked by other sculptures. Water cascades over the rocky formations into a large basin, where underwater lights give the water a turquoise glow. On either side of the fountain, multi-story buildings with yellow and orange facades curve inward due to the lens distortion. A crowd of people gathers around the edge of the fountain.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
