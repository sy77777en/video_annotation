    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot from a high angle, showing the upper bodies of three humanoid figures positioned in the foreground, occupying the lower half of the frame. A central gray figure stands in the center, flanked by two red figures on its left and right. The camera then pulls backward, transitioning the view into a high-angle full shot that reveals the complete figures standing on a dark, gridded floor. In the middle ground and background, several large, unfinished wooden frame structures are arranged, with some tilted over. The floor in the foreground is scattered with numerous small, multi-colored objects surrounding the figures.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Three low-polygon, humanoid figures stand together. The central figure is entirely white, with shadows creating a grayish appearance, and wears a large, open, crinkled golden coat over a white garment at its neck. It stands still, facing forward. To its left and right are two red figures with a similar faceted appearance. The red figure on the right is facing the left side of the frame, standing straight with its arms at its sides, wearing what appears to be a hooded sweatshirt and pants. The red figure on the left, dressed similarly, has its right arm bent at the waist, its left hand raised to its chest, and its head slightly bowed. The video starts with a view of their upper bodies and then reveals their full forms as the perspective pulls back.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a digitally rendered indoor space with a dark gray, gridded floor, three low-polygon human figures stand in the foreground. Two of the figures are solid red, while the central figure is white with a textured golden coat. Behind them, several large, unfinished wooden frame structures are positioned, with multiple tilted at an angle. The floor is scattered with small, multi-colored, gem-like objects. An overlay of white text at the bottom-left corner of the scene reads \"[12.13]\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows three humanoid subjects in a scene with many wooden shelves in the background. The subjects on the left and right are red, while the one in the middle is gray. Initially, only their upper bodies are visible, occupying the lower 40% of the frame‘s height. As the camera moves backward, their full bodies are revealed, transitioning to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
