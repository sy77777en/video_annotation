    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a large vessel is positioned in the right middle ground, moving forward through the water and leaving a wake. Numerous ice floes are scattered across the sea, appearing in the foreground, middle ground, and extending into the background. The dark water fills the lower and central parts of the frame, while an overcast sky occupies the upper portion in the background. The camera is positioned at the ship's level, maintaining a consistent distance as it tracks the vessel's movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large vessel, identified by the name \"HAFGUVA\" in white letters against its dark blue hull, moves through dark, icy water. The hull is dark blue at the bottom and white on the upper half, featuring a dark blue stripe. The ship has a white, multi-level superstructure with a dark blue base and an orange emblem on the bow. Adjacent to the mast, there is a tall white tower with a spherical white radome on it. The vessel is surrounded by numerous white ice floes of various sizes scattered across the water's surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a vast, open sea under a uniformly grey and overcast sky, the dark water is scattered with numerous white ice floes. A large, white and blue vessel with the name \"HAFGUVA\" visible on its hull navigates through the icy expanse. The ship, featuring a prominent superstructure with a radar dome and antennae, moves steadily forward, leaving a clear wake behind it as it pushes through the floating ice.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
