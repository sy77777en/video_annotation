    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a woman, who is positioned in the center of the frame and occupies the foreground. In the background, a building is visible on the right. As the woman walks away from the camera, the shot transitions into a medium close-up, maintaining her central position in the frame while bringing her upper body closer to the viewer. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, blonde hair is seen from the rear-side. She has a slender build and tanned skin. She is wearing a bright pink, ribbed tank top with thin straps and a square neckline. Her bottoms are blue and have a visible zipper at the back with a circular pull ring.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors at dusk in a dusty, unpaved area. The sky is a pale, warm color, indicating either sunrise or sunset. In the background, several single-story buildings with dark roofs are partially visible. The low light casts the foreground into shadow, silhouetting a person with long hair who is walking away from the camera. The person is wearing a pink, ribbed tank top with thin straps and blue bottoms with a circular zipper pull at the waist. Their hair moves slightly, suggesting a gentle breeze.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
