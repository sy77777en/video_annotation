    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot viewed from a stationary, eye-level perspective through a dark doorway. The light-gray exterior walls of the doorway are in the foreground, framing the scene. In the middle ground, a ball of fire hovers in the lower center of the frame, suspended above a central walkway. This walkway is flanked by two narrow blue panels on the floor at the bottom of the frame. The reddish-brown corner of the room occupies the background. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly zooms in, causing the foreground doorway frame to gradually move out of view while the fire and the room in the middle and background grow larger, moving closer to the viewer while maintaining their central position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an interior scenery shot, framed by a light-gray exterior wall of a dark doorway, that looks into a dimly lit, reddish-brown corner. A ball of fire hovers in the lower-center of the space, its flickering flames casting a warm glow primarily on the textured floor and illuminating small, floating embers. On the floor below, two narrow blue panels create a stark color contrast with the fiery scene. There is no main subject because the shot's purpose is to establish a mysterious and intense atmosphere, with the focus placed on the environmental composition and mood rather than a specific entity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is viewed through a dark, rectangular opening with light gray exterior walls, looking into a dimly lit, cornered room. The room's walls and floor are a dark, reddish-brown color. Suspended in the lower center of the space, a bright ball of fire flickers with orange and yellow flames, while small, white particles resembling embers float in the air. On the floor, two narrow, light-blue panels run parallel to each other, flanking a central walkway that leads toward the corner where the fire hovers.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
