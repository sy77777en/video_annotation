    "pre_caption": "This video is a static, extreme wide scenery shot captured from a low angle looking up. A massive formation of dark storm clouds dominates the composition, filling the upper, central, and right portions of the frame and occupying the middle ground and background. A dark, flat horizon line sits at the very bottom of the frame in the background, with a few faint, distant lights visible on the far left. The scene is dynamically illuminated by flashes of lightning. Diffuse sheet lightning pulses within the clouds, primarily lighting up the upper-right and central areas of the frame. Simultaneously, distinct forked lightning bolts flash briefly in the lower portion of the sky, with one appearing in the bottom left and another in the bottom right, just above the horizon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic skyscape scenery shot of a powerful thunderstorm raging at night. There is no single main subject because the focus is on capturing the immense scale and raw energy of the atmospheric event itself. The vast, dark sky is dominated by a colossal, churning mass of storm clouds, so dark they are nearly black. The scene is intermittently and violently illuminated by flashes of lightning; some are sharp, branching bolts that crackle low on the horizon, while others are diffuse sheet lightning that lights up the interior of the clouds, casting an ominous and beautiful purple glow across the turbulent cloudscape. A few faint, distant lights twinkle along the dark, flat horizon, providing a subtle sense of scale against the overwhelming power of the storm above.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a powerful thunderstorm unfolds over a dark, flat horizon, likely a body of water. The sky is filled with immense, dark storm clouds that are tinged with a deep purple hue. The scene is intermittently illuminated by flashes of lightning. Some of these flashes are diffuse, lighting up the massive cloud formations from within, while other distinct, forked bolts of lightning streak across the lower portion of the sky. On the far left horizon, a few distant, faint lights are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
