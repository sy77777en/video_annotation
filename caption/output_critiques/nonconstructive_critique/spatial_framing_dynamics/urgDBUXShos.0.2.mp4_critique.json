    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is initially positioned in the left foreground with his back mostly to the camera, while a woman stands in the right foreground facing him. A dark cityscape is visible in the background. The camera then pans right as the man turns, shifting his position to the center-right foreground to face the woman, who is now in the center-left foreground. This camera movement reveals a crowded party scene with guests and a table in the midground and background. The camera continues to shift slightly, framing the man on the left and the woman on the right as they stand face-to-face, with the party guests blurred behind them. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man and a woman stand very close to each other, face-to-face. The man has light skin covered in white face paint, with black makeup around his eyes and a wide, smeared red smile painted on his face. His shoulder-length, wavy hair is a mix of green and brown. He wears a purple suit jacket over a dark shirt and dark gloves. The woman has light skin and brown hair styled in an updo. She is wearing a dark green, short-sleeve dress with beaded or sequined straps. The man holds a small, silver knife as he leans in and speaks to the woman, who looks back at him with a concerned expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at night within a high-rise building during a formal gathering. Large windows in the midground reveal a dark cityscape punctuated by the lights of other skyscrapers. The interior is moderately lit and populated by numerous guests in formal attire who are mingling throughout the space. In the midground, a white-clothed table can be seen. The camera's perspective shifts prominently, offering different views of the crowded party environment surrounding the two central figures in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
