    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot of an urban park scenery begins from a high angle. Initially, a large tree is in the center middle ground, with a three-story apartment building behind it and distant mountains in the background at the top of the frame. A chain-link fence and a street with parked cars are visible in the lower middle ground, with the edge of a gravel field in the foreground at the bottom. The camera then pulls backward and descends, which reveals the full expanse of the gravel soccer field occupying the foreground and bottom half of the frame, with a white soccer goal now positioned in the center-right foreground. This movement repositions the fence, street, and apartment building into the middle ground across the center of the shot. The large trees on the left, right, and center continue to frame the scene, while the mountains and sky remain in the background at the top. The camera finishes at a lower, but still elevated, position relative to the field.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an urban park scenery shot, descending to reveal a wide view of an empty gravel soccer field. The field, featuring a single white goal, is set against a backdrop of a three-story, brown-brick apartment building and a street with parked cars, partially visible through sections of a chain-link fence. Several people can be seen moving along the street, adding a touch of life to the scene. Large, leafy green trees frame the scene on both sides, with distant mountains visible under a partly cloudy blue sky. The camera's movement serves to establish the quiet, sunlit environment and capture the overall atmosphere of the location, emphasizing the sense of place by blending natural and urban elements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone descends over a light-colored gravel sports field during the day. A white, rectangular soccer goal is positioned on the field, which is bordered by a chain-link fence. Beyond the fence, a street with several parked cars runs in front of a multi-story, brown brick apartment building. The scene is framed by large, leafy green trees, and in the distant background, mountains are visible under a blue sky with scattered clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a wide shot of an urban park from a slightly elevated angle. A large tree is prominently featured in the foreground, with a three-story apartment building visible behind it. The mountains are initially obscured but become visible as the camera moves. A chain-link fence and a street with parked cars are seen in the middle ground, while the edge of a gravel field is in the foreground. The camera then pulls back and lowers, revealing the full expanse of the gravel soccer field in the foreground, with a white soccer goal now in the center-right. This movement shifts the fence, street, and apartment building to the middle ground. Large trees frame the scene on the left and right, while the mountains and sky become visible in the background. The camera settles at a lower position, providing a comprehensive view of the field.",
