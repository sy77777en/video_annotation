    "pre_caption": "This high-angle wide shot initially frames three men in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a paved area. A building facade is visible in the background at the top of the frame, with another person's legs at the top right. As the three men walk from the center towards the bottom left, the camera zooms in, transitioning to a medium shot. This movement brings the men, with the central figure being escorted, into closer view, while the background building and the person at the top right move out of the frame. A round cover on the pavement, initially in the middle ground on the right, also exits the frame during the zoom.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with short, dark hair, wearing a dark suit jacket over a light-colored collared shirt, is the central focus as he is escorted by two other men across a cobblestone surface. His hands appear to be restrained in front of him. To his right, a light-skinned man in a black suit, white shirt, and blue tie holds his arm. To his left walks a light-skinned man in a dark blue, short-sleeved police uniform, complete with a police hat and a white belt. Before the camera zooms in for a tighter view, other people are visible in the surrounding area, including one in a blue uniform.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a wide, paved outdoor area during the day, viewed from a high-angle, observational perspective. The ground consists of dark gray, rectangular cobblestones. Initially, the top of the frame shows a brown brick facade of a building, which goes out of frame as the camera zooms in. Three men walk across the open space; a man in a dark jacket is flanked by a man in a suit and a police officer in a dark blue uniform. A light-colored cover is embedded in the pavement on the right, which also goes out of frame as the camera zooms in.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
