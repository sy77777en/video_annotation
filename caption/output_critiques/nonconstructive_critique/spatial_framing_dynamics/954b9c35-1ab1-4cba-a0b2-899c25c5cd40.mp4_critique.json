    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot from directly above, a woman stands in the center-right of the frame on a dark, paved surface that occupies the entire scene as the middle ground. A yellow car is initially positioned in the top-left of the frame, also in the middle ground. As the clip progresses, the car moves in a circular path around the woman, arcing from the top-left toward the top-right of the frame, while the woman remains relatively stationary in her position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From an overhead, bird's-eye view, a woman with a darker skin tone and long, dark hair stands on a dark, paved surface marked with circular tire tracks. She is wearing a black t-shirt and has a shiny, possibly metallic object on her right arm. She moves her arms, initially holding them outstretched to her sides before bringing them in toward her body. To her left, a bright yellow, vintage-style four-door sedan is driving around her in a counterclockwise direction with its headlights illuminated.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye view, a bright yellow vintage four-door sedan with its headlights on is positioned on a dark, paved surface. The asphalt is marked with dark, circular tire tracks. A woman in dark clothing stands in the center of the ground, surrounded by the tire tracks, as the car appears to be driving around her. Shadows of the person and car are cast on the ground, slightly to the lower left, suggesting an overhead light source.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
