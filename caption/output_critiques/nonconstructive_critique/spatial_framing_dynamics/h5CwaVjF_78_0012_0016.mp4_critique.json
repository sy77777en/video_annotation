    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of nine women in a dance studio, with two positioned in the foreground at the center-left and center-right, and the remaining seven arranged in the middle ground behind them. The camera then pulls back into a wide shot, revealing more of the studio's environment, including the mirrored left wall and the curtained back wall. As the camera moves, the dancers transition; the two front women move outward, and a new woman advances from the middle ground to occupy the center foreground. The other members reposition around her, with two flanking her in the foreground and the rest in the middle ground. Finally, the camera pushes forward, ending in a composition that frames the central woman in a medium shot while capturing the surrounding dancers in full shots. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout the entire sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of nine young women with light skin tones dancing in a coordinated routine. Initially, two women are at the front. The woman on the left has long, dark brown hair and wears a white, sleeveless, off-the-shoulder crop top with baggy white pants. The woman on the right has long, dark brown hair, a white beanie, a white, long-sleeved crop top, and baggy, light gray pants. As the group repositions, a woman with long, straight, black hair moves to the center, becoming the main focus. She is dressed in a white, short-sleeved crop top with a black waistband and light blue, baggy cargo pants with white patches. The other members dance around her. To her right is a woman with long, golden hair in a white, sleeveless crop top and dark blue jeans with a chain. To her left is a woman with long, dark magenta hair wearing a white, sleeveless crop top and baggy, dark blue pants. In the midground, one woman has a short, black bob and wears a white, long-sleeved top with black shorts and knee-high socks, while another has long, dark brown hair, a gray, sleeveless crop top, and baggy, dark green pants.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a spacious, brightly lit dance studio with a light-colored wooden floor. The ceiling features a modern design of wooden slats interspersed with white recessed panels and light fixtures, including a large, distinctive P-shaped light in the center. The left wall is entirely covered by a large mirror, with long, horizontal light strips running along its base on the floor. The back wall is concealed by floor-to-ceiling gray curtains. The right wall consists of white panels with horizontal stripes and a prominent solid red section. A black speaker is mounted on the ceiling to the left. In the center of this space, a group of nine women are performing a choreographed dance routine according to a set pattern.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera begins with a full shot of all the girls, then moves backward, transitioning to a wide shot. It then moves forward again and ends with a medium shot of the girl in the center and full shots of the others.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
