    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a man in a brown suit is positioned in the left-middle ground, viewed from behind. He walks from the left side of the frame toward the center-right, moving deeper into the scene. In the right foreground, a lit table lamp is visible. In the background, positioned to the right of the main subject, a man in a plaid shirt and a woman in a dark dress stand together. On the far-left wall, several vertical decorative hangings are mounted in the middle ground. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a light-skinned man with short, blond, mullet-style hair and a mustache, viewed from the back. He wears a brown suit jacket as he walks into a dimly lit room where other people are gathered. In the background, a man in a short-sleeved plaid shirt stands next to a woman with blond hair in an updo. This woman, also seen from behind, wears a dark, low-backed dress with thin spaghetti straps. In the right foreground, a lit table lamp features a cream-colored lampshade decorated with red and blue ribbons.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting at night, a man in a brown suit is viewed from behind as he walks into a room where a social gathering is taking place. Other people are visible in the background, including a woman in a dark red dress and a person wearing a plaid shirt. The scene is illuminated by warm light, with a table lamp in the right foreground featuring a white shade decorated with red and blue ribbons. On the wall to the left, long, vertical decorative hangings are mounted.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

In the background, a man in a plaid shirt and a woman in a dark dress are walking together from the right side toward the center, moving deeper into the scene. Additional people are visible in the background, adding to the depth of the scene. The camera pans slightly to follow the movement of the main subject, maintaining a level angle.",
