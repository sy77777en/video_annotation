    "pre_caption": "A full shot frames a glowing technological apparatus positioned in the center of the scene, set against a dark background. The device extends vertically through the frame, with its buoyant, oval-shaped top located in the top center and its wide, fan-like array of tethers anchored to the seabed in the bottom center. The entire structure occupies the middle ground, while the textured seafloor stretches across the bottom of the frame from the foreground into the middle ground. The long, singular tether connecting the top and bottom components emphasizes the vertical depth of the dark environment. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A single, complex technological apparatus is depicted in a dark, deep environment. The device features a large, white, smooth, oval-shaped float or buoy at its apex. A long, thin, glowing white tether extends vertically downward from the float. At the lower end of this main tether, a series of thinner, glowing white lines fans out in a wide, conical array, appearing to be anchored to multiple points on the dark, textured surface below. Each glowing white line features a white light along its length. The entire structure is self-illuminated against a black background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, deep-sea environment, a glowing white apparatus is anchored to the textured seabed. The device features a buoyant, teardrop-shaped object floating at the top, connected by a single, long, illuminated tether to a base array. Near the seafloor, this central tether splays out into numerous thinner, glowing lines that are anchored in a wide, fan-like pattern across the dark ocean floor. The scene is monochromatic, with the only light source being the apparatus itself, starkly contrasted against the surrounding blackness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
