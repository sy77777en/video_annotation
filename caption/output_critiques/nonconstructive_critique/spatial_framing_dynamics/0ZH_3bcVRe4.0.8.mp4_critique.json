    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man in a police uniform occupies the left side of the frame in the middle ground, while a silver-haired man is positioned to his right, also in the middle ground. The scene is filled with floating papers, a bottle, and fine debris suspended in the foreground, middle ground, and background, creating a sense of depth. The silver-haired man, initially on the right, manipulates the police officer's left arm, moving his fist toward the officer's own chin. Subsequently, the silver-haired man moves from his position on the right, passes behind the police officer, and exits the scene from the left side of the frame. The camera remains static and positioned at the subjects' level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two light-skinned men are shown in a scene that appears frozen in time. The man on the left wears a dark police-style uniform with a peaked cap, a white collared shirt, a tie, and yellow stripes on the sleeves. He has short, dark hair and initially has both arms stretched forward. To his left stands another man with styled silver hair, wearing dark sunglasses and a shiny silver jacket over a dark t-shirt. This silver-haired man manipulates the first man's movements, positioning his left hand near his face to make it appear as though he is punching himself. The silver-haired man later exits the frame from behind the first man and from the left side of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors within a dimly lit, confined room with dark silver walls. The air is filled with a multitude of objects suspended in extreme slow motion. White papers float and tumble through the space, alongside a cloud of fine, white, particle-like debris and many water droplets that permeate the environment. A man in a dark uniform with a cap stands on the left, while a man with silver hair and sunglasses in a metallic-looking jacket is on the right, both positioned amidst the suspended chaos. Later, the man with silver hair disappears from view on the left.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
