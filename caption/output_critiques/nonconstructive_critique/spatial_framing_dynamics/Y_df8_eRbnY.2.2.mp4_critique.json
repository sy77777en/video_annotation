    "pre_caption": "This screen recording displays a video editing interface where a clip browser is in the top left, a main viewer is in the center, a timeline is at the bottom, and an inspector panel is on the right. Initially, the central viewer shows a video clip of three people from the chest up. A man is on the left, a woman is in the center-right, and a third person is on the far right, all positioned in the middle ground around a table that occupies the foreground. The view within the central viewer then zooms in, transitioning from the shot of the people to an extreme close-up of a dark, grainy texture that fills the entire viewer, with a cursor visible in the center. The camera in the original clip is positioned at approximately the subjects' height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a screen recording of the Final Cut Pro video editing software. The interface shows a video clip in the main viewer, a timeline located at both the lower center and the lower left of the frame, and an inspector panel on the right with various settings and effects. The video clip being edited features three young adults with light skin in a dark environment, illuminated by small lanterns. A woman wearing a dark beanie and a red hooded sweatshirt with \"STANFORD\" in white letters across the chest is positioned slightly to the right of the frame's center, with her mouth open in an excited expression. On the left side of the frame is a man with short, dark hair smiling at the camera. On the right side of the frame, a third person wearing glasses is partially obscured by shadow. They are gathered around a table covered with a blue and white patterned cloth, on which sit two small, glowing lanterns, a clear glass jar, and what appear to be playing cards. During the recording, the user zooms into the video clip to 200%, causing the image to become a dark, grainy texture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a software or system interface displays a video editing application with a dark gray theme. The layout features a preview window positioned slightly above the center, a timeline in the lower left section, a clip browser in the top left corner, and an effects inspector on the right. The central viewer shows a dark, nighttime outdoor scene with people around a table illuminated by small lanterns. As an overlay, the timeline below shows a sequence of clips, while the inspector on the right lists video properties and a library of effects like \"8mm GRAIN FX\" and \"VINTAGE HOME MOVIE.\" The project is titled \"Film Grain - an easy solution to fixing crappy footage.\" During the sequence, the view of the nighttime footage is zoomed in to 200%, revealing a dark, grainy texture.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
