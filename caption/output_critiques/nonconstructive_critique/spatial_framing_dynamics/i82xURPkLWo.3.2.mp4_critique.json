    "pre_caption": "The video is captured in a static full shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. A man in a brown shirt occupies the left side of the frame, seated in a black chair in the middle ground. To his right, a man in a blue shirt sits on a brown leather sofa, positioned on the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground. A coffee table is centered between them in the foreground, holding a red can on its left side and a green bottle near its center. In the background, large windows reveal a grassy yard and trees, while a desk area is visible in the background on the far right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a sunlit room, two men are seated across from each other, engaged in conversation. The man on the left is a Black man with short dark hair, wearing a brown short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants. He sits in a black chair, leaning forward with his hands clasped together. The man on the right is a bald white man wearing a light blue button-down shirt and dark trousers. He sits on a brown leather couch, also leaning forward and gesturing with both hands. On the dark wood coffee table between them, there is a red can of Coca-Cola, a green glass bottle of beer, a shallow woven bowl, and some papers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene is set during the daytime in a rustic room with large windows that look out onto a grassy yard and trees. Sunlight streams into the space, illuminating the weathered, paneled walls. A brown leather sofa is positioned on the right side of the frame, facing slightly towards the lower left corner, while a black chair is on the left side, facing towards the camera and the lower right corner. A dark wood coffee table sits between them, holding a red Coca-Cola can, a green beer bottle, and a small woven bowl. In the background, a desk area is cluttered with various tools and items.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
