    "pre_caption": "This scenery video is captured in an extreme wide shot from a high-angle perspective, presenting a layered cityscape. The foreground, occupying the bottom half of the frame, consists of low-rise residential buildings and green trees. In the middle ground, a dense cluster of downtown skyscrapers stretches horizontally across the center of the frame, with a body of water visible on the far left. The background is dominated by a mountain range that spans the upper portion of the frame, positioned above the city, with the sky filling the topmost area. Throughout the shot, the camera performs a slow, subtle downward drift, slightly lowering its viewpoint over the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a sweeping cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vast urban landscape on a clear day. The camera moves downward, enhancing the sense of scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than focusing on a specific object or person. In the background, a majestic mountain range with green slopes and a slight hint of snow on the peaks stretches across the horizon under a partly cloudy blue sky. In front of this natural backdrop, the dense downtown core of a modern city rises, filled with numerous skyscrapers and high-rise buildings. The foreground consists of a greener, more residential area with lower-rise apartment buildings and houses interspersed with lush, leafy trees, creating a layered perspective from the neighborhood to the bustling city center and the mountains beyond.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone presents a dynamic, wide-angle view of Vancouver, Canada, during the daytime. The camera moves downward, revealing a residential area in the foreground with low-rise apartment buildings interspersed with numerous lush green trees. Further in the distance, the dense downtown core is visible, characterized by a cluster of modern skyscrapers. The entire cityscape is set against a backdrop of large mountains, some of which have snow-capped peaks. The sky is blue with scattered white clouds, and a body of water is visible to the left of the city.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
