    "pre_caption": "In this extreme wide shot with a top-down perspective, a large, cross-shaped wooden platform occupies the right half of the frame in the middle ground, situated over water, while a cave environment fills the left and top portions. A pixelated character begins in the center-left of the frame, standing on a grassy path within the cave. The character moves to the right, briefly pausing to place a fence post on the ground, which is preceded by a white, transparent placement preview appearing in front of them. They then continue right, crossing a small wooden bridge and stopping at the center of the frame, positioned at the entrance to the main platform. Throughout the video, static UI elements remain fixed in the foreground: health and status bars are in the top-left corner, a mini-map is in the top-right, an inventory hotbar is at the bottom-center, and controller prompts are in the bottom-right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel-art video game scene, a character with black hair, a brown hat, a red top, and blue pants stands on a wooden bridge at the left entrance of a large wooden platform. This structure is built over water inside a dark cave and is highly organized. The platform is connected to the cave floor by multiple wooden bridges. At the top of the platform, there is a single row of green storage chests. The central area includes a workbench, kitchen equipment, a blue bed, and various crafting stations, including a furnace and an anvil. The entire platform is illuminated by a grid of torches placed on the floor. The character is shown placing wooden railing posts where the bridge connects to the cave floor, with an inventory bar at the bottom displaying tools like a pickaxe, a fishing rod, and torches.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows an underground cave setting, where the camera is placed above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides. The dimly lit scene, illuminated by numerous flickering torches, features a natural cave area on the left with dirt ground, patches of green moss, and reddish, organic-looking terrain. To the right, a large, cross-shaped wooden platform is constructed over a body of dark water. This platform is furnished with a row of green chests, beds, and crafting stations like a furnace and an anvil. A small, pixelated character walks from a fenced path in the cave onto the wooden platform. Overlays are present on the screen: health and status bars are in the top-left corner, a mini-map is in the top-right, an inventory hotbar is at the bottom-center, and controller button prompts are in the bottom-right. The bottom hotbar dynamically updates to reflect the player's actions, with the highlighted slot changing as the character switches tools, displaying items like a pickaxe, torches, wooden floors, or fence pieces. Item counts decrease when materials are placed in the world. When the character prepares to build, a transparent placement preview appears above the selected hotbar item. Additionally, when the player scrolls to the leftmost slot with the up/down arrow icon, contextual prompts such as “Swap hotbar up (R3 + R1)” and “Swap hotbar down (R3 + L1)” appear in the lower-right corner of the screen, offering further interaction guidance.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
