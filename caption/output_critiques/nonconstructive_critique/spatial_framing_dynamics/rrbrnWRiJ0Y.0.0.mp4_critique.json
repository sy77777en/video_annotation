    "pre_caption": "A hand holding a black Insta360 camera is positioned in the foreground and centered in the frame in a close-up shot. In the background, a wide, snowy mountain slope with evergreen trees is visible. On the camera's rectangular screen, located in the center of the device, a full-body shot of a skier is displayed. This skier is initially in the center of the small screen, moving away from the recording camera's perspective down a snowy path. The viewpoint on the screen is from above and behind the skier, following their descent. In the main scene's middle ground, another blurred skier is partially visible behind the handheld camera. A small, illuminated blue light is at the bottom of the camera body, and the text \"Insta360\" is overlaid in the bottom right corner of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned hand holds a black, vertical Insta360 camera, which is centered in the view. The camera features a large, circular lens at the top and a rectangular screen in the middle. The screen displays a video of a person skiing down a snowy, tree-lined slope, viewed from the rear-side. This skier wears a black ski suit and has a black-and-white backpack, while holding ski poles. In the background of the main scene, the same individual shown on the camera screen is also visible on the snow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a close-up shot, a hand holds a black, vertical 360-degree camera mounted on a textured grip. The scene takes place outdoors on a sunny day, with a blurred background of a wide, snowy mountain slope dotted with evergreen trees under a clear blue sky. The camera's screen displays a video from a first-person perspective, showing a skier navigating down a snowy, tree-lined path. A small, blue light is illuminated at the base of the camera body. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"Insta360\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a hand holding an Insta360 camera overlaid at the center of the frame in a close-up shot. On the camera’s screen, a full-body shot of people skiing ahead is displayed.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: In the overlaid camera view, the camera is positioned above the people.",
