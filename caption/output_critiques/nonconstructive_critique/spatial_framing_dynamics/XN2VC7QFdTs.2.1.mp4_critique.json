    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured at the subject's level, a man in a suit occupies the middle ground, moving from the right side of the frame towards the left along a narrow rooftop ledge. In the immediate foreground, potted plants and a colorful pinwheel are positioned at the bottom left. The background is divided, with a large, dense crowd on the street below occupying the lower half of the frame from the center to the right. Above the crowd, a large classical building spans the upper portion of the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a light-skinned man with short blond hair, walking quickly along the narrow ledge of a rooftop. He is dressed in a dark suit, a white collared shirt, and a dark tie. In his right hand, he carries a black object that appears to be a firearm. Below him, a large, dense crowd of people participates in what looks like a parade or festival on the street. The crowd includes individuals in costumes and a prominent skeleton figure, suggesting a Day of the Dead celebration. The entire scene is cast in a yellowish, hazy light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage point on a rooftop, an outdoor city scene unfolds during the daytime. The air is thick with a yellowish-brown haze, partially obscuring a large, classical-style stone building across the street. Below, a wide street is densely packed with a crowd and large skeletal figures, indicating a parade or festival is in progress. The immediate foreground is a rooftop ledge made of light-colored stone, decorated with potted plants and a small, multi-colored pinwheel. A man in a dark suit walks briskly along this ledge, moving at a 90-degree angle to the street below.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
