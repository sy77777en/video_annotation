    "pre_caption": "This third-person, top-down video starts with an extreme wide shot, showing a character in the upper-center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground of a cave. In the foreground, a user interface is displayed, with status bars at the top-left, a minimap at the top-right, and a hotbar along the bottom. The camera follows the character as they move downwards, causing the scenery to scroll and reveal minecart tracks on the left and a wooden platform that comes to occupy the lower half of the frame. The character walks onto the platform, moving to the center of the screen. A large inventory menu then appears as a foreground overlay, covering most of the frame. The menu closes, returning to the extreme wide shot with the character now stationary in the center of the wooden platform in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video shows a top-down view of a 2D pixel-art game centered on a player character, a small figure with dark hair, light skin, a yellow top, and dark pants. The character navigates a dark cave environment with minecart tracks and patches of orange slime. The game's user interface features health and status bars in the top-left corner, a minimap in the top-right, and a hotbar at the bottom with icons for tools such as a pickaxe, shovel, and sword. At one point, a large, grid-based inventory menu overlays the scene, temporarily hiding the minimap and hotbar, and displays various collected items like wood, stone, and berries. A text box within this menu provides a detailed description of a \"Heart Berry.\" The menu then closes, and the view returns to the player character standing on a wooden platform surrounded by water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows a character in a dark, pixel-art cave, where the camera is placed above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides. The cave features brown dirt floors with patches of green grass and large, irregular puddles of orange slime, all illuminated by torches. As the character moves, a minecart track comes into view from the lower part of the frame, eventually appearing in the upper left, while a large, patterned wooden platform emerges in the central and lower-middle areas. This platform is built over a body of dark water and is furnished with a blue bed, several crafting stations, and rows of green-lidded chests. The character moves from the upper cave area onto the platform and interacts with a gray workbench. Overlays are visible, including health and mana bars in the top-left, a minimap in the top-right, an inventory hotbar at the bottom, and controller prompts in the bottom-right. An inventory menu also temporarily appears, showing items in a grid and a description box for a \"Heart Berry.\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a third-person top-down 2D game video. It starts with an extreme wide shot of a character in an anime cave scene. Later, a game equipment operation interface pops up and occupies most of the frame. Finally, the interface disappears, and the video returns to the extreme wide shot of the character.\n\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
