    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot filmed at the subjects' level, a white McDonald's cup is positioned in the center middle ground on a red surface, set against a black background. To its right, in the background, is a yellow paper bag, while an open white box occupies the bottom left foreground. A red rectangular game piece, initially attached to the center of the cup, peels off and moves forward toward the camera. As it travels into the foreground, it rotates to reveal its white underside, coming to a stop floating slightly left of the frame's center. The other elements remain stationary throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A red, rectangular game piece is peeled off a white paper McDonald's cup. The cup features the word \"McDonald's\" printed vertically in lime-green letters. As the game piece detaches, its white underside is revealed, displaying black printed text and the code \"676XHQ1P6\". In the background, a brown paper McDonald's bag with the yellow Golden Arches logo is partially visible. The scene is set on a red tabletop with a black background, featuring an open white pizza box, paper cups, and McDonald's paper bags.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stylized, brightly lit setting, a white McDonald's cup with lime-green lettering stands on a brown board on a red surface. A yellow McDonald's bag with the golden arches logo and an open white pizza box are positioned in the mid-ground. The background is a black space. A red, rectangular game piece peels away from the side of the cup, floats forward, then rotates, revealing its white underside printed with black text and a code.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
