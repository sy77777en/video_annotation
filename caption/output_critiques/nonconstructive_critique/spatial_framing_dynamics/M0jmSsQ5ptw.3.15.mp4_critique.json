    "pre_caption": "The scene opens with a medium shot focused on a tall wooden table positioned in the foreground, occupying the lower half of the frame. A can of Red Bull on a block of ice is centered on the table, with a helicopter in the right middle ground and mountains in the background. A man, initially framed in a medium shot showing his upper body, enters from the left foreground and approaches the table at the center. After he takes the can, he moves toward the left, briefly exiting the frame before re-emerging holding a ski. As he runs from the left foreground toward the helicopter in the right middle ground, the shot transitions to a full shot, following his movement. The camera is positioned at the man's height and remains so throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A tall wooden table is positioned in the foreground, with a blue and silver Red Bull can sitting on a block of ice, flanked by two yellow ice axes stuck into the tabletop. In the background, a helicopter prominently displays a large Red Bull logo in white, yellow, and red graffiti, complemented by extensive black and white graffiti patterns. A man with light skin, wearing a light beige jacket, black pants, a grey beanie, and blue goggles pushed up on his forehead, runs into the scene. He approaches the table, picks up the can, and then turns, carrying a black and white ski with the Red Bull logo in his right hand, to run toward the helicopter.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Outdoors on an airfield tarmac, with distant mountains visible under a cloudy sky, a large wooden workbench stands in the foreground. Two yellow ice axes are embedded in the tabletop, supporting a block of ice between them. A person in a light beige winter jacket approaches the table, holding a black and white ski in their right hand. They pick up a can of Red Bull from the ice and then turn to run towards a helicopter parked on the pavement, which features white, yellow, and red Red Bull branding.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The scene opens near a landing pad. A can sits on a tall table dominating the frame. In the distance, a plane stands before the mountains, ready for takeoff. A man with a skateboard enters from the left, his upper body visible. He takes the can and then circles the table toward the plane, briefly leaving the frame with only his hand and skateboard in view. Then he shows again, and the shot shifts from a medium shot to a full shot of him.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
