    "pre_caption": "A full shot shows a black sedan positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The car travels through a tunnel, with its walls framing the scene on the left and right, extending from the foreground to the background. The road is visible at the bottom of the frame. A green sign briefly passes in the top-left background. The camera, positioned at the car's level, tracks the vehicle from a rear three-quarter angle as it moves forward, keeping the car's position relatively static within the frame while the surroundings blur with motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A glossy black BMW sedan is shown from a rear three-quarter perspective. The car has a wide body, a low stance, and its distinctive L-shaped taillights are illuminated in bright red and white. A dark blue license plate with the white text \"REIN\" is centered on the trunk. A flashing sticker or light with the text \"EURO WERKE\" is visible on the lower portion of the rear window, with additional indistinct words appearing as a flashing sticker or light on the upper portion of the rear window.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A black sedan drives through a uniformly lit tunnel, captured from a rear-quarter tracking shot. The car's bright red and white taillights are illuminated, casting a red reflection on the dark asphalt road behind it. The license plate reads \"REIN,\" and a sticker or light with the text \"EURO WERKE\" is visible on the rear window, along with another sticker or light with indistinct text above it. The concrete walls of the tunnel and the road surface show motion blur as the camera follows the vehicle's movement. Light green rectangular signs are briefly visible on both sides of the tunnel wall, in the upper part of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
