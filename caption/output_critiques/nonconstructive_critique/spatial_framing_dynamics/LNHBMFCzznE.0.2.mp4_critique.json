    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a woman positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Behind her, a vibrant blue, geometric backdrop occupies the background. As she speaks, she gestures with her hands and slightly turns her head and upper body to her right. The camera remains static and is positioned at her level throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged woman with fair skin and shoulder-length brown hair in a bob-style cut is shown speaking. She is wearing a dark gray, sleeveless, V-neck top with a subtle horizontal pattern. Around her neck, she wears a thin chain with a small, dark pendant. She also has a thin, flesh-colored microphone headset on the right side of her face. She stands facing forward, gesturing with her hands as she talks, with a watch visible on her left wrist.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors on a stage, against a vibrant, solid blue backdrop. The background is composed of large, angular, geometric shapes in varying shades of blue, creating an abstract and modern visual effect. Bright lighting illuminates the stage and the backdrop. A woman stands in the center of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The camera subtly pans and tilts to follow her movements throughout the clip.",
