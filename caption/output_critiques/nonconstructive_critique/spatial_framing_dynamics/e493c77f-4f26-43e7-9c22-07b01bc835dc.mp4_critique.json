    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot initially frames a person in a suit in the top center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground above a vast background cloudscape that fills the lower portion of the scene. The camera is positioned below the subject. The perspective then shifts to a high-angle view from above the subject, who now tumbles downwards through the center of the frame. As the camera follows their descent, the background becomes entirely filled with the cloudscape below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, seen from a great distance, is in freefall high in the atmosphere above a dense layer of white clouds. The individual is wearing a bulky suit that is primarily white with dark, possibly black or dark blue, sections on the limbs and torso. The suit's shape suggests it could be a spacesuit or a high-altitude skydiving suit. The person is tumbling through the air, seen in various orientations against the backdrop of the sky and clouds.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Initially, the deep azure of the upper atmosphere is visible. As the camera tilts downward, a vast, dense layer of white clouds comes into view. A person wearing a black and white suit is seen tumbling and descending rapidly from the upper atmosphere toward the expansive cloudscape below. The view follows the person as they move from the clear, dark blue sky into the thick, white cloud cover that stretches to the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to above the subject.",
