    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide, high-angle scenery shot of a computer-generated model of a large complex. The complex fills the frame, viewed from an aerial perspective. A reddish-brown perimeter wall encloses the central and largest part of the facility, which is positioned in the middle ground. Within this enclosure, a prominent white building sits slightly left of the frame's center, while another large industrial structure is located in the upper-middle ground. Numerous smaller buildings are arranged in rows throughout the enclosed area. Outside the perimeter, additional buildings are scattered in the foreground at the bottom left and in the middle ground to the right. The entire complex is situated on a flat, brown landscape that extends into the background. The camera remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an aerial scenery shot of a computer-generated model depicting a large, sprawling industrial or military complex. There is no main subject, as the camera's slow pan across the scene emphasizes the vast scale and layout of the entire facility rather than any single element. The complex is situated in a flat, barren, brown landscape under a low sun that casts long shadows. It consists of numerous blocky, geometric buildings colored in muted shades of white, light green, and reddish-brown. A prominent reddish-brown perimeter wall encloses the core section, which contains several larger, more intricate structures, including a multi-level white building at the center and another with tower-like features nearby. The overall composition highlights the organized, yet extensive, nature of the isolated site.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, objective perspective, the scene displays a 3D digital rendering of a sprawling complex set within a vast, flat, brown landscape. The complex is composed of numerous rectangular buildings, colored in shades of white, light green, and reddish-brown. A distinct reddish-pink line delineates a large, enclosed area containing the majority of the structures, including a prominent white building with a red-lined roof at its center. Faint lines representing roads or paths are visible on the ground, and the entire scene is illuminated by a light source that casts long shadows, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon. An overlay of small white text, \"[8,10],\" is positioned in the lower left corner of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

The caption incorrectly states there is only one prominent white building when there are two, and the position of the buildings outside the perimeter wall is also described incorrectly. The caption fails to mention the diagonal arrangement of the central buildings and omits details about the appearance of the smaller buildings and other surrounding features.",
