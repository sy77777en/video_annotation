    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, surrounded by tall vegetation. Blurry foliage occupies the foreground, partially obscuring the view of the woman. In the background, a blurred mountainous landscape and treeline fill the space on the left and right, with the sky occupying the top of the frame. The woman executes a clockwise twirl in the center of the frame, transitioning from a left-facing profile to facing the camera. As she turns, the out-of-focus foliage in the foreground moves across the scene, creating a dynamic obstruction. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with light skin and short, fluffy pink hair styled in a half-up ponytail is shown. She wears a dark blue athletic tank top with a cutout or criss-cross design on the back, accentuating the muscles in her shoulders and arms. Her arms are raised at her sides with elbows bent and forearms naturally lifted, hands slightly open, creating a dance-like pose. Initially, she is positioned side-facing towards the left of the frame, twirling in a field as if dancing. After completing a full turn, she faces the camera. The scene is partially obscured by blurry foliage, giving it a distinct, textured, dot-patterned appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor scene takes place in a field of tall, dry, yellowish-brown vegetation under a pale, overcast sky, with a dark, blurry treeline visible in the distance. A figure with pink hair is present in the middle of the field, partially obscured by out-of-focus plant stalks that move across the foreground. A softly blurred mountainous landscape fills the background, and a faint, grid-like dot pattern is overlaid on the scene, most noticeably on the figure.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
