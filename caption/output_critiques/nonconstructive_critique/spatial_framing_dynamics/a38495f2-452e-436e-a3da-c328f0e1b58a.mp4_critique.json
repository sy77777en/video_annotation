    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme close-up of a woman positioned in the center of the frame against a blurry green background. The right side of her face is visible on the right, while her hair occupies the left and central portions of the frame. She then turns her head rapidly, causing her hair to sweep across the screen and creating significant motion blur. This movement transitions the shot into an even tighter extreme close-up, where her hair and a small part of her face fill the entire frame, obscuring the background. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned woman with long, brown hair is shown facing the camera directly. She is wearing a red top. She initially maintains eye contact with the lens, then rotates while moving closer to the camera, and ultimately returns to facing the camera directly, keeping eye contact throughout most of the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a person facing the camera directly, then spinning while moving closer to the lens, and finally returning to face the camera head-on. The scene is characterized by swift movement and a shallow depth of field, with brown hair and a portion of a red garment visible against an out-of-focus green background, suggesting an outdoor daytime setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a medium close-up of a woman positioned slightly off-center against a softly focused green background. Her face is turned slightly to the left, with her hair cascading down the right side of the frame. As she swiftly turns her head, her hair sweeps across the screen, introducing a dynamic motion blur. This movement transitions the shot into a close-up, where her hair and part of her face dominate the frame, but the background remains partially visible. The camera maintains a consistent level with the subject throughout this motion.",
