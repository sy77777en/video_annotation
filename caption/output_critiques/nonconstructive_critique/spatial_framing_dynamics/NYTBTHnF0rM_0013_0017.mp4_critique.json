    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot initially frames an animated man in the center foreground, set against a striped wall in the middle ground. The camera then dollies backward and pans to the left, which shifts the man's position to the right side of the frame. This movement reveals two multi-paned windows in the middle ground to his left. Through the leftmost window, the front portion of a silver car becomes visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated man with short, dark brown hair and a dark skin tone is shown from the chest up. He is wearing a dark blue, short-sleeved polo shirt with a collar. Initially positioned in the center of the frame, he moves to the right side, facing slightly to his right. Through a window behind him, the front portion of a silver or light gray animated car is visible, including its multi-spoke front wheel.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a room featuring pink and white vertically striped wallpaper. Two multi-paned windows with white frames are visible in the midground. Outside the windows, the front section of a silver car is clearly visible, parked outside. A 3D animated man wearing a dark blue polo shirt is positioned in the foreground. The perspective shifts with a dolly zoom, gradually revealing more of the window and the vehicle outside.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
