    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a static, one-point perspective shot down the center of an empty train corridor, with the far end of the aisle positioned in the background. An older man first appears in the middle ground, partially visible as he peeks out from a doorway on the left side of the frame. Next, a person in a pink sweater emerges from a doorway in the middle ground on the left, their full body visible as they walk down the central aisle toward the foreground before exiting the frame to the left. Following this, the older man and a woman in a poncho emerge from the same left-side doorway in the middle ground, captured in a full shot as they walk together down the center of the aisle toward the camera. The man exits to the left in the foreground, while the woman continues walking forward, transitioning the frame to a medium full shot of her in the foreground. Finally, another man appears behind her, emerging from the middle ground on the left. The camera remains stationary and at the subjects' height throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins in an empty train car, with natural light from the windows fluctuating between dim and bright as the train moves in and out of tunnels, while the ceiling lights remain consistently on. An older Asian man with glasses, graying hair, a dark blue suit, a white shirt, and a tie with a tie clip briefly peeks his head and shoulders out from a doorway on the left. Following this, a Black person wearing a light pink, textured, oversized sweater with light-colored pants, a headband, white plush slippers, and white plush headphones around her neck emerges from a room and walks toward the camera before exiting to the left. Subsequently, the man who previously peeked out completely exits the doorway and walks down the aisle toward the camera. Walking behind him is a woman with dark hair pulled back, wearing a gray and dark brown patterned poncho over a light-colored hoodie and blue jeans. They both continue walking forward, and the man also exits to the left. Near the end of the video, another man with a black head covering and a black beard appears behind the woman with dark hair pulled back, emerging from the corner between the left doorways.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within the long, narrow corridor of a train car, characterized by a uniform pale green color on the walls, doors, and curved ceiling. A metallic silver trim runs horizontally along the walls. The corridor is illuminated by long, recessed lights that consistently emit a cool white glow. Natural light from outside the windows shifts, causing the train car to alternate between dimly and brightly lit, suggesting the train is moving in and out of tunnels. On the left, a series of doors are visible. The right side features several windows covered by white roller blinds. The floor is covered by a textured carpet with a repeating pattern featuring straight lines on both sides. Throughout the scene, various people walk along the length of the corridor.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is positioned at the center of the train aisle. Initially, no one is in the frame. Then several people walk out of the cabin rooms one after another, showing their full bodies as they walk toward the camera; some eventually exit to the left of the frame. At the end, the shot captures a medium full shot of two people.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject, and the camera height remains unchanged.",

It fails to mention that after the person in the pink sweater emerges, the older man also steps out and walks down the aisle behind them, initially obscured. The description of the older man and the woman in the poncho is also imprecise; it incorrectly states they emerge from the same doorway and walk together down the center of the aisle, failing to specify that they walk one after the other and in different positions within the aisle. Furthermore, the caption is wrong about the final position of the woman in the poncho, incorrectly stating she reaches the foreground.",
