    "pre_caption": "The scene opens with a wide shot from the perspective of a car's front seat, looking forward through the windshield. The car's interior, including the sun visor at the top and the dashboard at the bottom, is blurred in the foreground, framing the view. In the middle ground, a dark, rounded sedan is centered on the road, with another classic car to its left and others further in the background, all under cones of overhead light. The camera then pans to the right, shifting the perspective to look out the side window. In this new framing, the blurred car interior remains in the foreground on the left and bottom. A dark house occupies the right side of the frame in the middle ground, featuring three lit windows. A fire hydrant is positioned in the bottom right foreground, and a tree is visible in the background to the far right of the house. The camera is at eye level from a seated position inside the car.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From the blurred interior of a car, the scene initially looks out through the windshield onto a hazy, nighttime road populated with several vintage-style cars under cones of overhead light. In the center of the frame is a dark, rounded sedan, possibly a Volkswagen Beetle, and to its left is a larger, dark classic sedan. As the perspective pans to the right, the view shifts to look out the side window at a dark, single-story house. The house features three rectangular windows, each glowing with a warm, yellow light from inside. On the sidewalk in front of the house stands a light-colored fire hydrant, and a dark tree with visible branches is situated to the right of the building.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Inside a moving car at night, the view through the windshield reveals a hazy, dark road. The scene is illuminated by strong, conical beams of light from overhead streetlights, casting a greenish glow. Several vintage-style cars are visible on the road ahead. The car stops before reaching a simple, dark building on the right with three brightly lit windows. A fire hydrant stands on the sidewalk near the building. The foreground is framed by the silhouette of the car's interior, including the dashboard and sun visor.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The scene opens from the car’s front seat, showing a wide shot of the road ahead. The car’s interior is blurred, while the road filled with cars is in sharp focus. As the camera pans right, the window frame remains out of focus, but the bright windows of a house outside appear clear.",
