    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a river scene, viewed from a high angle. A small boat carrying a man, a boy, and a dog is positioned in the lower center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. Further back in the middle ground and slightly to the left of the center, a white swan floats on the water. The river flows from the background toward the foreground, occupying the central portion of the frame. A large tree is prominent in the left foreground and middle ground, with its canopy extending over the water. The foreground and middle ground are defined by the lush green banks on the left and right sides of the river. In the background, a tree-covered green slope fills the upper portion of the frame. The entire composition remains static, with no changes in framing or significant movement of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a small, dark brown wooden boat floating on a calm river, a man is seated at the stern. He is wearing 18th-century style clothing, consisting of a dark coat and a black tricorn hat. To the man's left, a young boy dressed in dark-colored clothing is seated. Seated in the bow of the boat, facing forward, is a small, light-colored dog. Further up the river, a white swan is swimming. On the left bank, a large, mature tree with a thick trunk and a wide, leafy canopy hangs over the water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a verdant, pastoral landscape during the daytime, a calm river flows between lush, grassy banks. The banks are thick with reeds and other vegetation, and large, leafy trees are prominent, particularly on the left side of the river. In the background, a gentle green slope rises, covered in more trees. A small, dark-colored rowboat carrying a man, a boy, and a small dog is positioned in the middle of the river, with a white swan visible further upstream. The water is dark and reflects the surrounding greenery under bright, even light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

The description of the foreground and middle ground is incomplete. The claim that the composition is static and lacks movement is incorrect, as it fails to account for camera movement and the movement of elements within the scene.",
