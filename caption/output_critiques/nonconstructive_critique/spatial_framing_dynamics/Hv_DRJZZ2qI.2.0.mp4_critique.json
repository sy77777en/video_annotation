    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, two women are positioned in the foreground. The woman on the left occupies the left and center of the frame, while the second woman is on the right, positioned slightly behind the first. A reddish-brown hillside with sparse vegetation fills the background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level and remains static throughout the shot. The woman on the left moves her hand from her chin to a clasped position in front of her chest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two women are sitting next to each other, looking toward the right. The woman on the left has light skin, long blonde hair, and is wearing a black tank top. On her head is a white and grey knit beanie with a pom-pom. She wears a black wristband and a colorful patterned wristband on her left wrist. She wears a black wristband and a colorful patterned wristband on her right wrist. She initially has her hand near her mouth and then brings her hands together. The woman to her right has light skin and long brown hair. She is wearing black sunglasses, a black hooded jacket over a t-shirt with a pink and white graphic, a ring on her left hand, and a pink wristband. She keeps her hand near her mouth.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a bright, outdoor setting, two women are seated on a reddish-brown, dusty hillside. The ground is uneven and rocky, with sparse, dry vegetation scattered about. The woman on the left has blonde hair and wears a white and grey cable-knit beanie with a large pom-pom, along with a black tank top. To her right, another woman with brown hair wears black sunglasses and a black hooded jacket over a graphic t-shirt. Both appear to be watching something intently just out of view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
