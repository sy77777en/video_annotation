    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, with the ocean filling the background. The camera then tilts downward, transitioning to a medium shot that keeps the man in the center of the frame. This movement reveals the back of a woman's head and shoulders in the bottom-left foreground. The expansive ocean occupies the background throughout the scene. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a light-skinned, muscular man with short, wet dark hair. He is shirtless, wearing black swim trunks and a silver watch on his left wrist. He is walking toward the camera while simultaneously wiping his face and body with a blue towel. As the view shifts, a woman becomes visible in the lower-left portion of the scene. She is seen from behind, showing her long, dark, wavy hair and her shoulders, suggesting she is wearing a light-colored garment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a bright, sunny day at a beach next to a vast expanse of shimmering turquoise water. Gentle waves ripple across the surface of the ocean, which stretches to a hazy horizon where the faint silhouette of a sailboat is visible. A man wearing dark swim trunks walks toward the camera near the water's edge, holding a blue towel. In the foreground, the back of a woman with dark, curly hair is partially visible. The video is presented in a widescreen format, framed by black bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video takes place in a seaside setting, showing a shirtless man drying himself. It begins with a medium close-up of him, then tilts downward to reveal part of his lower body and the back of a woman on the left side of the frame, showing her shoulders and head.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
