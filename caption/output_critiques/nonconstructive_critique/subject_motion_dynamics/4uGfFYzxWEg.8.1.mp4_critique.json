    "pre_caption": "The video consists of a static shot of several posters and photographs displayed on a wall. There is no movement from the camera or any of the subjects in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main focus is on two posters displayed on a white wall. The poster on the left is a book cover for \"BAD SHOW\" by Bob Woffinden and James Plaskett, with the subtitle \"THE QUIZ, THE COUGH, THE MILLIONAIRE MAJOR.\" The cover is dark with white text and a bright, hazy light at the top. To its right is a poster for a 3-part limited event titled \"QUIZ.\" This poster features a man on the left with short dark hair, wearing a polo shirt and jeans. He leans forward with his hands clenched into fists and raised near his head, eyes closed, brow furrowed, and mouth wide open, revealing his teeth. His expression is excited and agitated, and his posture is full of tension. The man on the right, with short blond hair, is wearing a suit and sits upright with his head turned towards the man on the left, his mouth open. The text \"ARE YOU READY TO PLAY?\" is prominently displayed. To the far left of these posters, there are two other images: a newspaper clipping at the top featuring two photos—one of a man in a suit with a blue tie and a woman in a dark coat, and another of the same woman in light-colored clothing with a red scarf. Their facial expressions are mostly calm or slightly serious. Below it, there is a photograph of a man in a dark suit and a woman in a pink scarf walking outdoors.**",
