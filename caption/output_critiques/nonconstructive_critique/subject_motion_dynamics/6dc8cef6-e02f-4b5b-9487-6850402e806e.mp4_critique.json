    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, top-down perspective, a woman with multiple arms moves rapidly and simultaneously at a kitchen counter. One arm stirs a substance in a green bowl, another mixes ingredients in a different container, and a third wipes the counter surface. As she works, the camera subtly rotates around her. At the bottom of the frame, a separate pair of hands continuously assembles small, round food items.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a bird's eye view, a woman with tan skin and dark hair styled in a long, tight braid stands at a stainless steel kitchen counter. She wears a white short-sleeved shirt under a pink and white checkered apron. In a surreal depiction, she appears to have multiple arms, all simultaneously engaged in preparing food by stirring, mixing, and handling various ingredients in bowls. At the bottom of the scene, another person's hands are visible, assembling small, round food items. The red text \"in hundreds of hands\" is superimposed over the lower portion of the scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the camera perspective as \"high-angle\" is incorrect. The caption's description of the woman's arm movements is inaccurate, as it misrepresents the actions being performed by them, such as mixing in a container and wiping the counter, and it omits a specific count of the arms. The description of the hands at the bottom of the frame is also incorrect; it is not a pair of hands, and their presence is not continuous.",
