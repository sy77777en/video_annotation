    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot depicting the aftermath of destruction within a large, modern structure. From a high, top-down perspective, the camera looks down past massive grey and beige structural beams onto a desolate expanse of shattered grey concrete below. Dark, scorched-looking rubble is concentrated towards the center of the floor, while bright light streams in from a large window on the left, illuminating the ruined interior. There is no main subject, as the high-angle shot is designed to convey the immense scale and atmosphere of the devastation. The focus is on the ruined environment itself rather than any specific entity within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
