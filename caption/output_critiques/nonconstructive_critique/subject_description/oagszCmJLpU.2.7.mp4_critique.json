    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic time-lapse landscape scenery shot, capturing the immense power of nature. A colossal supercell storm cloud, a swirling mass of dark grey, charcoal, and ethereal blue-green hues, dominates the sky as it churns and advances across the frame. Below this turbulent canopy lies a vast, vibrant green field stretching to a distant horizon where sheets of rain are visibly falling. The scene lacks a singular main subject, as the composition emphasizes the overwhelming scale and atmospheric drama of the weather phenomenon itself, dwarfing the few small, silhouetted trees on the right and drawing the viewer's focus to the raw, environmental spectacle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
