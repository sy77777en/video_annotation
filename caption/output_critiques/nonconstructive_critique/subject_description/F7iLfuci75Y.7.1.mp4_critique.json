    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot of a futuristic data center corridor. The perspective moves forward down a long, straight aisle flanked on both sides by towering racks of computer servers. The floor consists of dark, reflective tiles with grated ventilation panels, while bright, cool-white rectangular lights on the ceiling illuminate the central path. The servers themselves are dark and enclosed in glass, but they are alive with glowing orange lights, including horizontal bars, blinking dots, and square panels, creating a stark contrast with the cool tones of the corridor. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and high-tech atmosphere of the environment, conveyed through the deep, one-point perspective of the seemingly endless server room.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
