    "pre_caption": "This video presents a digital cityscape scenery shot, depicting a futuristic urban environment under a bright, cloudy sky. In the foreground, simplified, block-like structures frame a view across a body of water that reflects the sky and distant buildings. The background features a dense cluster of skyscrapers, including the prominent Burj Khalifa and another uniquely shaped tower. There is no single main subject, as the low-angle, wide perspective is used to emphasize the grand scale and atmosphere of the entire metropolis rather than focusing on any individual element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
