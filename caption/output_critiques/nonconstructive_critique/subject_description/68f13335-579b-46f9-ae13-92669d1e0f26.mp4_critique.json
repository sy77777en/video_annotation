    "pre_caption": "This video presents a canted, top-down aerial cityscape scenery shot of a dense, modern urban environment. The scene is characterized by the geometric patterns of white and light-grey buildings with flat rooftops, many of which are detailed with solar panels and large, circular ventilation systems. Dark asphalt streets with crisp white markings and crosswalks weave between the structures, creating a stark contrast. There is no main subject, as the high-angle, wide perspective is used to emphasize the scale and intricate patterns of the urban grid. The focus is on the collective architectural environment and its impersonal atmosphere rather than any specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
