    "pre_caption": "This video presents a disaster scenery shot, capturing the immediate aftermath of an incident at a large, dark-colored building. Thick, dark grey and white smoke billows from a section of the building, obscuring parts of its facade. In the foreground, emergency vehicles, including red fire trucks and a yellow tanker truck, are parked on the lawn near the impact site. A few individuals are visible on the grass, with one person in a light-colored shirt standing near the road. A silver minivan is partially visible on the right, driving on a road separated from the scene by a guardrail. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to convey the scale and chaotic atmosphere of the emergency, focusing on the overall environment of the disaster rather than any specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
