    "pre_caption": "This is a panoramic scenery shot of a bustling college football stadium during a game. The video lacks a single main subject, as the camera's wide, sweeping view is intended to capture the immense scale of the event and the energetic atmosphere of the crowd rather than focusing on an individual person or action. The camera pans slowly from right to left, revealing the full expanse of the venue under a cloudy sky. The stands are densely packed with thousands of spectators, many wearing purple, creating a vibrant tapestry of fans. Below, on the bright green football field marked with the \"WILDCATS\" and \"NORTHWESTERN\" team names, players in white and dark uniforms are positioned for a play. In the background, a line of green trees separates the stadium from distant buildings, and a large video scoreboard is visible at the far end of the field.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
