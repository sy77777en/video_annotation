    "pre_caption": "This video presents a nature scenery shot, capturing a disorienting, spinning view looking directly up through a dense forest canopy where the dark silhouettes of tall trees and their branches blur into a circular vortex against a pale, overcast sky. There is no main subject because the focus is on creating an atmospheric and immersive experience of the environment. The rapid rotation abstracts the individual trees, emphasizing the scale of the forest and a feeling of vertigo rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
