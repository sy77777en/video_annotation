    "pre_caption": "This is an underwater scenery shot that explores a shallow marine ecosystem. The scene is characterized by large, algae-covered rocks resting on a sandy seabed, surrounded by dense beds of green seagrass. Numerous small, silvery fish, including some striped sergeant major fish, swim in schools around the rocks and through the seagrass. The camera's movement, which pulls back from a close-up and eventually breaks the water's surface to show the rocky shoreline, emphasizes the environment as a whole. There is no main subject because the focus is on the atmosphere and the interconnectedness of the habitat, showcasing the relationship between the rocks, plants, and fish rather than highlighting a single object or creature.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures an enchanting underwater scene within a shallow marine ecosystem. The view features large, algae-covered rocks resting on a sandy seabed, surrounded by dense beds of vibrant green seagrass. Schools of small, silvery fish, including striped sergeant major fish, colorful parrotfish, and darting damselfish, swim gracefully around the rocks and weave through the seagrass. The camera smoothly transitions from a detailed close-up of the marine life to a wider perspective, eventually breaking the water's surface to reveal the rocky shoreline. This movement highlights the interconnectedness of the habitat, showcasing the harmonious relationship between the rocks, plants, and diverse fish species, rather than focusing on a single object or creature.",
