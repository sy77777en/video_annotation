    "pre_caption": "The video presents an architectural rendering scenery shot of a sprawling industrial or scientific facility set within a vast, arid landscape. The focus is on the overall scale and unique design of the complex within its environment, rather than on a specific subject. The facility is characterized by a series of large, white, spherical structures resembling radomes, arranged in a row on reddish-brown earth and enclosed by a dark fence. Behind these prominent domes are various other white, blocky, modern-style buildings. The entire complex is bordered by a dark, dense forest that gives way to rolling, barren hills in the distance, all under a hazy, reddish-pink sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
