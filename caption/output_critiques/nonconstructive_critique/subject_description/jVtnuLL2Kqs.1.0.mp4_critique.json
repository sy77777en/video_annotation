    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, static cityscape scenery shot depicting a panoramic view of London along the River Thames. The scene is framed by two iconic modern skyscrapers: the tall, pointed Shard on the far left and the distinctively curved \"Walkie-Talkie\" building (20 Fenchurch Street) on the right. The wide, brown river flows through the center, with a historic warship, HMS Belfast, moored near a bridge in the mid-ground. The entire vista is bathed in the warm, hazy glow of a low sun, casting a golden hue over the water and the mix of glass-fronted and traditional buildings lining the banks. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to capture the expansive scale and atmosphere of the urban environment, emphasizing the grandeur of the location rather than any specific object or action within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
