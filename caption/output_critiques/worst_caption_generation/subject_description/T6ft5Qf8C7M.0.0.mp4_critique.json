    "pre_caption": "This video presents a point-of-view scenery shot from a vehicle driving down a paved road at night. The road is marked with a solid white line on the left and a dashed yellow line in the center, with the headlights of an approaching car visible in the distance. To the right, a white wooden fence runs alongside the road, illuminated by several streetlights, while more distant lights and the faint silhouette of trees are visible against the dark sky. There is no main subject in this scene; the focus is instead on capturing the quiet, atmospheric experience of a nighttime drive. The moving perspective emphasizes the environment and the journey itself rather than any specific entity within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "A group of three cyclists, each wearing brightly colored reflective jackets and helmets, ride side by side along a narrow dirt path during the daytime. The cyclist in the center, a man with light skin and a short beard, leads the group, while the woman on his left, with long dark hair tied back, smiles and gestures toward the trees lining the path. The third cyclist, a young boy with a blue backpack, follows closely on the right. All three are riding mountain bikes with thick tires, and their shadows stretch out behind them. The scene focuses on the camaraderie of the group as they navigate the sunlit trail together, with no vehicles or other people present.",
