    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a large, illuminated Ferris wheel against the blackness of the night sky. The camera is positioned to capture the wheel head-on, emphasizing its perfect radial symmetry as its spokes, lit in warm yellow and orange hues, extend from a brilliantly glowing central hub. Along the outer circumference, each passenger cabin is marked by a triangular arrangement of bright red lights, creating a captivating, starburst-like pattern. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the mesmerizing visual pattern and vibrant atmosphere of the structure itself, rather than a specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling city street scene at dusk, with a group of three men in business suits walking side by side along a wide sidewalk. The man in the center, who has light skin, short brown hair, and glasses, carries a black briefcase and appears to be engaged in conversation with the man on his left, who has darker skin, a neatly trimmed beard, and wears a blue tie. The third man, on the right, is clean-shaven, has blond hair, and holds a smartphone in his right hand while glancing at the screen. Several parked bicycles line the curb, and a yellow taxi is visible in the background, partially obscured by the group. The focus is on the interaction between the men as they walk, with the city environment providing context but not serving as the main subject.",
