    "pre_caption": "This is a nature scenery shot set within a tranquil wooded area, with the camera positioned among several tree trunks looking out towards a more open, grassy space lined with distant trees. The video lacks a single main subject, as its primary purpose is to demonstrate a shallow depth of field, indicated by the \"f/3.5\" text on screen. The focus deliberately shifts from the background trees to the textured bark of the foreground trees, emphasizing the serene atmosphere and the visual interplay between different planes of the environment rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

She is facing the camera with a neutral expression, and her hands are clasped around the umbrella handle. To her right, a small brown dog with a white patch on its chest sits attentively, looking up at her. The woman and dog are positioned on a paved sidewalk, and a silver bicycle is leaning against a metal railing behind them. There are no other people or vehicles visible, and the focus remains on the woman and her dog throughout the video.",
