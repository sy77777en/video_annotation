    "pre_caption": "This video presents a nature scenery shot, capturing a disorienting, spinning view looking directly up through a dense forest canopy where the dark silhouettes of tall trees and their branches blur into a circular vortex against a pale, overcast sky. There is no main subject because the focus is on creating an atmospheric and immersive experience of the environment. The rapid rotation abstracts the individual trees, emphasizing the scale of the forest and a feeling of vertigo rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a group of people gathered in a brightly lit indoor gymnasium, with several men in white karate uniforms performing synchronized martial arts routines at the center. Around them, a few women in colorful athletic wear are seated on benches, watching attentively. The main subject, a tall man with short dark hair and a black belt, leads the group with precise hand movements and a focused expression. The polished wooden floor reflects the participants, and a row of basketball hoops is visible along one wall. The scene remains centered on the martial arts demonstration, with no significant changes in subjects or transitions throughout the video.",
