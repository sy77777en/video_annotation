The trees, with their golden-brown and amber foliage, are dramatically illuminated by a band of sunlight that cuts across the middle of the frame, creating a strong contrast with the dark, shadowed rock face of the mountain looming in the background. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the vastness of the natural environment and the atmospheric quality created by the interplay of light and shadow across the textured landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a group of people hiking along a sandy beach at sunset. The central figure is a man wearing a bright blue jacket, khaki shorts, and a wide-brimmed hat, walking barefoot near the water’s edge. He is accompanied by a woman in a white sundress and a young child holding a red bucket. Several seagulls are visible flying overhead, and a small wooden boat is anchored close to shore. The focus is on the interaction between the people and the coastal environment, with warm sunlight casting long shadows across the sand.",
