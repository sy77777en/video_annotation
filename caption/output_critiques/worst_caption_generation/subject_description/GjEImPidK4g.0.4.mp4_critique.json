The out-of-focus background features the bright, indistinct lights of a city at night, creating a hazy and dreamlike quality. There is no main subject in the scene; the focus is intentionally placed on establishing a moody, nocturnal urban atmosphere rather than highlighting any specific element within the environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

She faces the camera with a neutral expression, her gaze directed forward. To her left, a small brown dog with a short tail sits attentively, looking up at her. The woman is standing on a cobblestone street, and a vintage blue bicycle is propped up against a nearby lamppost. The overall composition highlights the interaction between the woman and the dog, with the bicycle and lamppost serving as secondary visual elements.",
