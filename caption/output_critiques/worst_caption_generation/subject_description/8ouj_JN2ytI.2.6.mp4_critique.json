    "pre_caption": "A group of spectators, mostly white men and women, are gathered in stadium seating, leaning against a metal railing with tense expressions. In the center-left, a man with short blond hair, wearing a black jacket, a gold chain, and blue jeans, stands with his hands on the railing, looking forward seriously. To his right, a man in a black jacket and blue jeans leans forward heavily on the railing, looking intently ahead. Behind him, another man in a striped black and grey shirt over a yellow t-shirt also leans on the railing with a focused gaze. To the left of the blond man, a man in a black jacket and a woman with red hair, who has her hand to her head, both have concerned expressions. In the lower right, a man with dark hair in a black hooded jacket peers through the bars of the railing. The crowd is dressed predominantly in black and yellow clothing, with some individuals wearing yellow headbands or holding yellow cloths.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

A man with curly black hair, wearing a red scarf and checkered pants, stands at the center holding a large silver mixing bowl, looking down with a focused expression. To his right, a woman in a blue apron and glasses is carefully slicing vegetables on a cutting board, while another man in a green chef jacket sprinkles herbs onto a plate. Behind them, a man in a white chef coat and a woman with short blonde hair, both wearing black gloves, are arranging pastries on a tray. In the foreground, a young man with a ponytail and a yellow apron is whisking eggs in a glass bowl. Several other chefs, some with embroidered hats or colorful neckerchiefs, are preparing ingredients or plating dishes, with the group’s attention centered on the food preparation. The scene is filled with kitchen utensils, bowls, and fresh produce, and the chefs are actively engaged in cooking tasks.",
