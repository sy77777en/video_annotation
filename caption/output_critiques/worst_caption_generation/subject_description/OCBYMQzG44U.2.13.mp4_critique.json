    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot of a surreal, flooded interior space. The low, water-level perspective looks through an arched tunnel, its walls and vaulted ceiling covered in uniform white tiles, toward a larger, hazy, and brightly lit circular room in the distance. The lower half of the scene is filled with rippling, murky green water, creating a stark contrast with the sterile white tiles. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the unsettling and dreamlike atmosphere of the liminal space. The immersive viewpoint is used to emphasize the environment itself rather than directing attention to a particular object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling city street scene with several pedestrians walking along a wide sidewalk. The main subject is a middle-aged man with light skin, short brown hair, and a trimmed beard, wearing a blue business suit and carrying a black leather briefcase in his right hand. To his left, a woman in a yellow dress and white sneakers is holding a red umbrella, while a young boy in a green jacket and jeans rides a blue bicycle nearby. Parked cars line the street, including a red sedan and a white van, and a large digital billboard displaying colorful advertisements is visible in the background. The subjects are all moving from right to left, and the overall focus is on the lively urban activity rather than any single individual.",
