    "pre_caption": "This is a residential scenery shot featuring a large, two-story house constructed from red brick with a dark, shingled roof. The home's design includes white-trimmed windows, a prominent arched window above the entryway, and a small gabled section over the front door. A black, wrought-iron-style fence encloses a manicured green lawn in the foreground, with various plants, including a tall, slender palm-like tree and green bushes, situated between the fence and the house. The shot lacks a main subject because its purpose is to establish the setting. The focus is on the architectural style and the overall affluent atmosphere of the property rather than on any specific character or action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This is a cityscape shot featuring a busy intersection with several yellow taxis and a blue city bus stopped at a traffic light. Tall glass office buildings with reflective windows line both sides of the street, and a large digital billboard displays an advertisement for a new smartphone. Pedestrians, including a man in a gray suit carrying a briefcase and a woman in a green dress with a sunhat, wait on the sidewalk to cross. The focus is on the urban environment and the bustling activity of downtown rather than on any single individual or vehicle. There is no main subject, as the scene is intended to convey the energy and movement of a metropolitan area.",
