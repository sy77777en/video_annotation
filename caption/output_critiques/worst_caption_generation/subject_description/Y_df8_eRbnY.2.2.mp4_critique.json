    "pre_caption": "This video is a screen recording of the Final Cut Pro video editing software. The interface shows a video clip in the main viewer, a timeline at the bottom, and an inspector panel on the right with various settings and effects. The video clip being edited features three young adults with light skin in a dark environment, illuminated by small lanterns. In the center, a woman wearing a dark beanie and a red hooded sweatshirt with \"STANFORD\" in white letters across the chest has her mouth open in an excited expression. To her left, a man with short, dark hair is smiling at the camera. To the woman's right, a third person wearing glasses is partially obscured by shadow. They are gathered around a table covered with a blue and white patterned cloth, on which sit two small, glowing lanterns, a clear glass jar, and what appear to be playing cards. During the recording, the user zooms into the video clip to 200%, causing the image to become a dark, grainy texture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The workspace displays a high-resolution photograph in the main window, with a toolbar on the left and a layers panel on the right. The photograph features two middle-aged men with dark skin standing outdoors in bright daylight, both wearing white lab coats and safety goggles. The man on the left has a shaved head and a neatly trimmed beard, while the man on the right has short, curly hair and is holding a clipboard. They are examining a large, metallic sculpture shaped like a spiral, which is positioned on a grassy lawn. In the lower portion of the interface, adjustment sliders for brightness and contrast are visible, and the user applies a sepia filter to the image, causing the colors to shift to warm brown tones.",
