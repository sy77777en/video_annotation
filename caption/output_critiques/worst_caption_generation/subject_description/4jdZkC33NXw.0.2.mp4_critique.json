The wet pavement reflects the overcast sky, and utility poles with a web of wires stretch along the road, emphasizing the urban environment. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on the tranquil atmosphere, the interplay of architecture and nature, and the sense of scale created by the receding street, rather than any specific object or individual.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video features a bustling outdoor market scene, with several vendors standing behind colorful stalls filled with fresh fruit and vegetables. A woman in a bright yellow dress and wide-brimmed hat is seen selecting apples from a wooden crate, while a man in a blue jacket and glasses arranges bunches of bananas on his table. Children with backpacks walk past the stalls, some stopping to look at the produce. In the background, a red double-decker bus drives by, and a street musician plays a guitar near a lamppost. The focus is on the lively interactions between the shoppers and vendors, with the vibrant produce and busy atmosphere creating a sense of community.",
