    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of seven young women with light skin tones dancing in a coordinated routine. Initially, two women are at the front. The woman on the left has long, light brown hair and wears a white, long-sleeved, off-the-shoulder crop top with baggy white pants. The woman on the right has long, dark brown hair, a white beanie, a white, long-sleeved crop top, and baggy, light gray pants. As the group repositions, a woman with long, straight, black hair moves to the center, becoming the main focus. She is dressed in a white, short-sleeved crop top with a black waistband and light blue, baggy cargo pants with white patches. The other members dance around her. To her left is a woman with long, blonde hair in a white, sleeveless crop top and dark blue jeans with a chain. To her right is a woman with long, dark brown hair wearing a white, sleeveless crop top and baggy, dark blue pants. In the background, one woman has a short, black bob and wears a white, long-sleeved top over a black top with black shorts and knee-high socks, while another has long, dark brown hair, a gray, sleeveless crop top, and baggy, dark green pants.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The camera begins with a full shot of all the girls, then moves backward, transitioning to a wide shot. It then moves forward again and ends with a medium shot of the girl in the center and full shots of the others.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

At the start, two men stand at the front; the man on the left has short, curly black hair and wears a red, sleeveless athletic shirt with black track pants, while the man on the right has a shaved head, a blue headband, a blue, long-sleeved athletic top, and fitted white pants. As the group shifts positions, a man with short, spiky blond hair moves to the center, taking the lead. He is dressed in a black, short-sleeved T-shirt with a red stripe and loose, gray sweatpants. The other members execute moves around him. To his right is a man with a buzz cut, wearing a green tank top and black cargo shorts. To his left is a man with shoulder-length brown hair, a yellow sleeveless shirt, and gray joggers. In the midground, one man has a thick beard and wears a white, long-sleeved hoodie with red shorts and ankle socks, while another has a ponytail, a black tank top, and blue jeans.",
