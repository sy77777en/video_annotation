    "pre_caption": "This is a park scenery shot capturing a tranquil autumn day, viewed through the dark, ornate silhouette of a structure like a bridge or gazebo. The framing creates a window onto a landscape filled with trees displaying vibrant orange and yellow foliage under a warm, soft light. The ground is carpeted with fallen leaves, and in the background, the faint outlines of city buildings peek through the treeline, while a few distant figures stroll leisurely through the park. There is no single main subject; the video's focus is on the overall picturesque atmosphere, the rich seasonal colors, and the layered composition of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This is a bustling city street scene featuring a group of cyclists wearing bright neon jackets and helmets, riding in a single file along a wide, paved road. On the left, a row of parked blue and white taxis lines the curb, while several pedestrians in business attire, including a man in a gray suit and a woman in a green dress, wait at a crosswalk. In the center, a large digital billboard displays an advertisement for a new smartphone, and overhead, traffic lights hang from metal poles. The focus is on the dynamic movement of the cyclists and the busy urban environment, with no single main subject dominating the scene.",
