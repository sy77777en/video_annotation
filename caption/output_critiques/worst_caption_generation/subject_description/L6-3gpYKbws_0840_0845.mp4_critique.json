    "pre_caption": "This is an underwater scenery shot that explores a shallow marine ecosystem. The scene is characterized by large, algae-covered rocks resting on a sandy seabed, surrounded by dense beds of green seagrass. Numerous small, silvery fish, including some striped sergeant major fish, swim in schools around the rocks and through the seagrass. The camera's movement, which pulls back from a close-up and eventually breaks the water's surface to show the rocky shoreline, emphasizes the environment as a whole. There is no main subject because the focus is on the atmosphere and the interconnectedness of the habitat, showcasing the relationship between the rocks, plants, and fish rather than highlighting a single object or creature.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This is a city park scene featuring a wide, paved walking path lined with tall, flowering cherry blossom trees. Several people are visible: a woman in a bright yellow sundress and sunhat is riding a red bicycle, while a man in a blue suit and glasses walks a small white dog on a leash nearby. Children in colorful jackets are playing with a large, rainbow-striped beach ball on the grass to the right of the path. The camera slowly pans upward to reveal a skyline of modern glass skyscrapers in the distance, emphasizing the contrast between the natural park setting and the urban environment. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the lively atmosphere and the interaction between people, pets, and the park landscape.",
