    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a static, low-angle perspective of a prominent modern skyscraper. The building features a distinctive curved, top-heavy design with a facade of reflective glass and a grid-like pattern, set against a bright, hazy sky. In the foreground, the tops of older, more traditional stone buildings with numerous windows and chimneys frame the base of the skyscraper. The composition lacks a singular main subject, instead focusing on the architectural contrast and the immense scale of the modern structure in relation to its historic urban surroundings, thereby creating a powerful sense of place and atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling outdoor market scene, focusing on a group of street vendors standing behind wooden stalls covered with colorful striped awnings. The vendors, including an older woman in a green apron with short gray hair and a young man in a blue shirt and baseball cap, are arranging baskets of fresh fruit and vegetables, such as oranges, bananas, and leafy greens. Several shoppers, including a woman in a yellow dress holding a canvas tote bag and a man in a brown jacket with glasses, are browsing the produce and engaging in conversation with the vendors. In the background, a red double-decker bus passes by, and a large clock tower rises above the market, adding to the lively urban atmosphere. The composition centers on the interaction between the vendors and shoppers, highlighting the vibrant colors and dynamic energy of the marketplace.",
