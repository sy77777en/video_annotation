    "pre_caption": "This video is an ascending aerial cityscape scenery shot that reveals a sprawling urban center against a mountainous backdrop. The view begins over a lush canopy of green treetops, gradually rising to show a mix of low-rise residential buildings and a prominent, grid-patterned high-rise. In the distance, a dense downtown core filled with skyscrapers and a visible construction crane stretches across the horizon, all framed by a majestic range of hazy blue mountains, some with snow-dusted peaks, under a partly cloudy blue sky. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the expansive environment and the grand scale of the city's integration with nature, rather than on any specific person or object. The shot is designed to convey a sense of place and atmosphere by capturing the relationship between the urban landscape and its natural surroundings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video is a sweeping aerial shot of a vast desert landscape dominated by rolling sand dunes and scattered cacti. The view starts above a dry, cracked earth surface, gradually rising to reveal a series of small, isolated tents and a single winding dirt road leading toward a distant oasis lined with palm trees. In the far background, a cluster of wind turbines stands atop low, rocky hills under a clear, cloudless sky. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the arid environment and the sense of isolation created by the sparse vegetation and minimal human presence, rather than on any specific person or object. The shot is designed to highlight the stark contrast between the barren desert and the small signs of life scattered throughout the scene.",
