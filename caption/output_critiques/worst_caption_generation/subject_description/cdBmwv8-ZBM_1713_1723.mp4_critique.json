    "pre_caption": "The main subject is a man with short, blond hair, seen from an over-the-shoulder perspective. He is wearing a brown leather jacket with a light-colored shearling collar over a dark shirt and dark pants. He is initially seen standing before raising a silver handgun to aim. As he moves forward, several other men appear. One man, wearing a cap, a light-colored long-sleeved shirt, and dark pants, runs past him. Another man with a beard, wearing a reddish vest over a shirt, stands near a large bonfire holding an axe. A third man with a dark beard and dark, simple clothing approaches the main character from near the fire. Other men in similar rustic clothing are visible in the scene, one of whom is lying on the ground, while another figure is being burned on the bonfire.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This is a 3D game video. The camera follows the character’s movements from behind. The character is shown in a medium shot initially, but the shot shifts between close-up, medium, and full shots as the camera zooms in and out. As the character moves, multiple NPCs appear, fully visible.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The main subject is a woman with long, dark hair, viewed mostly from a side profile. She is dressed in a bright blue raincoat over a white turtleneck sweater and light jeans. She is first seen sitting on a wooden bench, then stands up to release a small white dove from her hands. As she walks forward, several children appear. One child, wearing a yellow hat and red jacket, is playing with a toy airplane and runs past the main character. Another child with curly hair, dressed in a green sweater and blue shorts, is blowing bubbles near a large fountain. A third child with straight hair and a striped shirt is skipping rope close to the main character. Other children in colorful clothing are scattered throughout the scene, playing with various toys, while a large balloon floats upward in the background. The camera occasionally shifts to a close-up of the woman’s face as she smiles, but primarily remains at a medium distance, capturing her interactions with the children.",
