    "pre_caption": "This is a nature scenery shot depicting a dense, dark forest at night. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the eerie and claustrophobic atmosphere of the nocturnal woods rather than a specific object. The camera slowly pans across a multitude of pale, slender tree trunks that stand starkly against the pitch-black background, their light-colored bark faintly illuminated by an unseen source. In the shadowy gaps between the foreground trees, a tangled web of thinner, darker branches and trunks creates a sense of depth and impenetrable darkness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

There is no main subject, as the focus is on the movement and energy of the city rather than any particular person or object. The camera slowly pans across a wide street lined with tall glass buildings, with several yellow taxis and pedestrians in business attire crossing at the crosswalks. In the distance, digital billboards display colorful advertisements, adding vibrancy to the bustling scene.",
