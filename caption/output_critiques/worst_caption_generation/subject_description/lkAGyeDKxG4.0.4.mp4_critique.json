    "pre_caption": "This is an aerial scenery shot offering a top-down perspective of a dense, autumnal forest. The treetops, colored in shades of golden yellow and amber, are selectively illuminated by sunlight, creating a stark contrast with the deep, dark shadows of the forest floor below. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the abstract patterns and rich textures of the canopy. The expansive, bird's-eye view emphasizes the scale and atmosphere of the natural environment rather than any specific element within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video presents a wide aerial view of a sprawling cityscape, with clusters of tall glass skyscrapers reflecting the midday sun. Several busy roads filled with moving cars and buses crisscross the scene, while a large river winds through the center, spanned by multiple bridges. The focus is on the geometric arrangement of the buildings and the dynamic flow of urban traffic, with no single structure or vehicle standing out as the main subject. The shot emphasizes the scale and complexity of the metropolitan environment rather than highlighting any particular landmark or individual.",
