    "pre_caption": "This is a nature scenery shot captured from within a canyon, looking up towards the sky. The view is framed by the dark, craggy silhouettes of massive reddish-brown rock formations that rise up on both sides, with a sliver of pale blue sky visible between them. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to emphasize the natural environment and create a specific atmosphere. The focus is on the stark contrast between the enclosed, textured rock and the open, smooth sky, highlighting the scale of the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The scene is dominated by tall glass skyscrapers reflecting sunlight, with several billboards displaying colorful advertisements. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the bustling city environment and the movement of people and vehicles, emphasizing the energy and scale of the metropolitan setting.",
