    "pre_caption": "This video presents a panoramic cityscape scenery shot of London's South Bank. There is no main subject because the camera's slow, sweeping motion is intended to capture the expansive urban environment and its atmosphere, rather than isolating a single person or object. The shot pans from left to right across the brown, sun-dappled waters of the River Thames, starting with a partial view of the iconic Tower Bridge's stone tower and blue suspension cables. The camera then glides past a modern residential complex with stacked, glassy levels and an adjacent green park, before revealing the distinctive, rounded glass facade of City Hall and the towering, pointed silhouette of The Shard against the bright, hazy sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a sweeping view of a bustling harbor filled with large cargo ships and colorful shipping containers stacked along the docks. The camera pans slowly from right to left, beginning with a close-up of a red and white lighthouse standing at the water’s edge. As the shot continues, several cranes painted bright yellow are visible loading goods onto the ships, while a group of workers in orange safety vests and hard hats walk along the pier. In the distance, a tall, white suspension bridge with arched supports spans the harbor, and a cluster of low, brick warehouses lines the shoreline under a clear blue sky. The focus remains on the industrial activity and maritime infrastructure, with no single person or object isolated as the main subject.",
