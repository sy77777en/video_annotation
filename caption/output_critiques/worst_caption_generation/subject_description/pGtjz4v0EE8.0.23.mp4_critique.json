    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a magnificent, light-colored stone basilica, likely the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute in Venice, as indicated by a transit stop sign. The grand structure is defined by its massive central dome, intricate Baroque facade adorned with numerous statues in niches, and ornate carvings. The perspective shifts from a ground-level view under a bright, hazy sky, which includes a construction crane in the background, to a clearer shot against a deep blue sky that highlights the architectural splendor and scale of the building. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the impressive atmosphere and environmental grandeur of the historic location. The camera's attention is on the architectural beauty and its place within the city, rather than on a specific character or object. The shot serves to establish a sense of place and awe.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling outdoor market scene centered on a group of street performers. The main subject is a young man with dark skin, wearing a bright yellow jacket and a red beanie, who is juggling three green apples while standing on a wooden crate. To his left, a woman with long blonde hair, dressed in a blue floral dress and white sneakers, plays an acoustic guitar and sings. Several children, some holding colorful balloons, are gathered around, watching the performance. In the background, a row of food stalls with striped awnings displays baskets of fresh fruit and vegetables. The camera maintains a steady, eye-level perspective, focusing on the lively interaction between the performers and the crowd, with no single object or landmark dominating the scene. The shot captures the vibrant atmosphere and communal energy of the market setting.",
