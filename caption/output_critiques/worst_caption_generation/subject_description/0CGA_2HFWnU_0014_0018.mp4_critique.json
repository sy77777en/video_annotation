The foreground is filled with a mix of low-rise residential buildings and abundant green trees, leading into a dense midground cluster of downtown skyscrapers and high-rises. There is no single main subject, as the camera's distant perspective is intended to emphasize the grand scale and atmosphere of the location. The focus is on the expansive environment and the juxtaposition of urban development with the vast natural landscape, rather than on a specific object or building.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a close-up view of a single large bronze statue of a horse rearing on its hind legs, positioned on a stone pedestal in the center of a small, circular plaza. Surrounding the statue are several people, including a man in a dark suit and a woman in a yellow dress, both standing and facing the sculpture. The man has light skin, short gray hair, and is holding a black briefcase, while the woman has medium skin, long black hair, and is wearing sunglasses. A young boy in a red jacket and blue jeans is sitting on the edge of the pedestal, looking up at the horse. The scene is framed by a ring of neatly trimmed hedges and a few decorative lampposts, with no tall buildings or natural landscape visible. The focus is on the interaction between the people and the statue, highlighting their varied poses and attire.",
