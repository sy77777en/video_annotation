    "pre_caption": "This is a split-level marine scenery shot capturing a tranquil bay flanked by a steep, verdant mountain on one side and a lush, tree-covered shoreline on the other. Several sailboats are moored in the distance under a partly cloudy blue sky, and the perspective begins at the water's surface before submerging to reveal the clear, turquoise water and the rocky, algae-covered seabed below. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on the immersive experience of the environment. The shot's purpose is to showcase the serene atmosphere of the bay and the beautiful contrast between the sunlit world above and the quiet, submerged landscape beneath the surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling city street scene with a group of people waiting at a crosswalk beside a row of yellow taxis. On one side, a tall glass office building reflects the sunlight, while on the other, a café with red awnings has several patrons seated at outdoor tables. The camera angle remains at street level, focusing on the movement of pedestrians, including a man in a blue suit carrying a briefcase and a woman in a green dress holding a shopping bag. There is no single main subject, as the emphasis is on the lively urban environment and the interactions between the various city dwellers. The purpose of the shot is to capture the dynamic energy of the city and the contrast between the modern architecture and the street-level activity.",
