    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a massive dust storm, known as a haboob, as it advances across a desert. The focus is on the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the natural event rather than a specific object. A towering, opaque wall of tan-colored dust dominates the view, rolling over a flat expanse dotted with saguaro cacti and sparse green shrubs. Above this phenomenon, the sky is split between dark, turbulent storm clouds on one side and a patch of clear blue with white clouds on the other, highlighting the storm's leading edge.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling city street scene during a heavy rainstorm, with several people walking under colorful umbrellas along a wide sidewalk lined with tall glass buildings. The focus is on a group of three men in business suits, each carrying a briefcase and wearing dark overcoats, as they hurry past a row of parked yellow taxis. Reflections from neon signs and streetlights shimmer on the wet pavement, while a woman in a bright red dress stands near a bus stop, holding a newspaper above her head for cover. In the background, a large digital billboard displays advertisements, adding vibrant light to the otherwise gray and rainy atmosphere.",
