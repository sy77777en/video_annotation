    "pre_caption": "This video is an architectural scenery shot, featuring a low-angle perspective looking up at a massive, cylindrical stone tower. The structure is composed of multiple stacked tiers, each encircled by an open gallery of slender columns and rounded arches, creating a repeating, intricate pattern against a vibrant blue sky filled with drifting white clouds. The focus is not on a specific subject performing an action, but rather on the overall atmosphere, emphasizing the monumental scale and grandeur of the architecture in relation to the vast, dynamic sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling city street scene with several people walking along a wide sidewalk lined with tall glass storefronts. The main subject is a woman in a bright yellow dress and white sneakers, carrying a large red shopping bag in her right hand as she walks past a row of parked bicycles. To her left, a man in a dark suit and blue tie is talking on his phone while standing near a street vendor’s cart filled with colorful fruit. In the background, a group of children wearing matching green uniforms are gathered around a street artist who is sketching portraits on a folding chair. The focus is on the lively urban atmosphere and the interactions between the various pedestrians and vendors.",
