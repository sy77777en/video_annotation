    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot, capturing expansive views of a barren, sandy shoreline meeting a calm, blue body of water under a pale sky, and transitioning to a wide, arid plain dotted with sparse, weathered structures and distant mountains beneath a clear blue sky. There is no main subject because the focus is on the vastness and emptiness of the environment, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the natural and semi-abandoned landscape rather than any specific object or individual. The visual narrative centers on the mood and character of the setting itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "The video features a bustling city street scene with several people walking along a busy sidewalk lined with tall glass buildings. In the center, a man in a dark business suit and red tie, with light skin and short brown hair, is talking on a smartphone while carrying a black briefcase. To his left, a woman in a yellow dress and white sneakers, with medium skin tone and long curly hair, is holding a coffee cup and looking at a tablet. Several cars, including a bright blue taxi and a white delivery van, are parked along the curb. The scene transitions with a hard cut to a crowded outdoor café, where groups of people are seated at metal tables under large red umbrellas, some eating pastries and others engaged in conversation. The focus remains on the lively human activity and urban energy throughout the video.",
