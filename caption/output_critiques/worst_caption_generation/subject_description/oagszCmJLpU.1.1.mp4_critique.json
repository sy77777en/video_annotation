    "pre_caption": "This video presents a time-lapse landscape scenery shot of a vast, golden prairie under a deep blue sky. A massive, billowing white cumulonimbus cloud with a dark, flat base dominates the frame, indicating an approaching storm. There is no main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale of the natural environment and the dramatic atmospheric conditions over a specific focal point. The focus is on the powerful interplay between the expansive, flat earth and the dynamic, towering cloud formation above it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling city street scene with several people walking along a wide sidewalk lined with tall, leafy trees. The main subject is a woman in a bright yellow dress and a wide-brimmed hat, carrying a red handbag and looking at her phone as she walks. Nearby, a man in a dark suit and glasses stands next to a blue bicycle, appearing to wait for someone. In the background, a group of children in matching green uniforms play with a soccer ball near a parked white van. The focus is on the lively urban atmosphere and the interactions between the various pedestrians and vehicles.",
