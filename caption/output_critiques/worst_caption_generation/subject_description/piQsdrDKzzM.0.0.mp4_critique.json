    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, offering a high-angle, symmetrical view down a long urban canyon. The perspective is framed by towering modern residential buildings on either side, leading the eye down a straight street with distant traffic. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale and architectural density of the environment, creating an atmospheric and imposing mood. This is enhanced by the low sun, which casts one side of the street into deep shadow while illuminating the other with a warm, golden light, highlighting the textures of glass and concrete across the numerous skyscrapers.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a bustling outdoor market scene, centered on a group of street vendors standing behind colorful wooden stalls filled with fresh produce and handmade crafts. Several women in bright floral dresses and wide-brimmed hats are arranging fruit baskets, while a man in a blue apron and straw hat is slicing watermelon for a line of waiting customers. Children with balloons weave between the stalls, and a small brown dog sits near a crate of apples. The market is lively, with people chatting and exchanging goods, and the overall composition highlights the vibrant activity and diversity of the crowd.",
