    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a motocross rider and their bike are suspended mid-air in the center-left of the frame, occupying the middle ground. Directly below them, their shadow is visible in the bottom-center foreground on the dirt track. The track itself, lined with small flags and hay bales, stretches from the foreground up into the middle ground. The background is composed of rolling, arid hills that fill the upper portion of the frame beneath a clear sky at the very top. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the entire scene remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man is captured in mid-air while riding a dark-colored motocross bike with a white rear fender. He is wearing a white and blue helmet with goggles that have a white frame and black lenses, a long-sleeved blue and white jersey, and white boots. The man is seated on the bike, which is tilted with its rear wheel elevated. Below the airborne rider and bike, their shadow is visible on the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on an outdoor motocross track in a hilly, arid landscape during the daytime. Under a clear, blue sky, rolling, dry hills form the background. Multiple dirt paths wind through the terrain, each bordered on both sides by rows of blue-and-white triangular flags, enhancing the scene's dynamic and organized appearance. Several hay bales are strategically placed along the paths. The overall visual style is desaturated with a distinct blue tint. A motocross bike is suspended in mid-air over the track, casting a dark shadow on the ground below.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

To the left, a row of parked cars lines the street in the background, while a lamppost rises in the top-left corner. The sidewalk, visible in the foreground, runs horizontally across the bottom of the frame. The camera is angled slightly above the cyclist’s head, looking down, and remains fixed as the cyclist does not move throughout the scene.",
