    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, a large pile of wreckage is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The sandy seabed extends across the bottom of the frame, from the dark foreground to the illuminated middle ground. Beams of light descend from the top of the frame, highlighting the central wreckage. A few small, glowing orbs are visible in the upper background, while smaller pieces of debris are scattered in the middle ground to the left and right of the main structure. The camera is positioned at the level of the wreckage.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, skeletal structure of unidentifiable mechanical wreckage rests on a sandy, undulating seabed deep underwater. The dark, fossil-like remains are broken and lie in a large heap, with one elongated component protruding sharply upwards from the main mass. The scene is illuminated by concentrated beams of light shining down from the dark blue water above, highlighting the wreckage and the surrounding seabed while leaving the rest of the area in darkness. A few smaller, detached pieces of the wreckage are scattered on the sand nearby. In the water above the remains, a few small, bright, glowing orbs are visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a dark, sandy seabed deep underwater. Beams of white light, appearing blue-green due to the seawater, penetrate the dark water from above, illuminating the middle and upper-middle areas of the frame. In this illuminated space lies the wreckage of a large, angular object, broken into several pieces and scattered across the ocean floor. The surrounding water is dark, with a few small, glowing points of light visible in the distance. A white text overlay with a gray background is located in the bottom left corner, displaying \"[14]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a single large coral structure positioned on the right side of the frame in the foreground. A school of small fish swims across the center and left side of the frame in the background, moving from left to right. The sandy ocean floor is visible only in the top left corner, while a cluster of seaweed occupies the bottom right foreground. The camera is angled slightly downward from above the coral, maintaining a higher vantage point throughout the shot. As the scene progresses, the fish gradually move closer to the foreground, while the coral remains stationary. No significant changes in shot size or camera height occur during the video.",
