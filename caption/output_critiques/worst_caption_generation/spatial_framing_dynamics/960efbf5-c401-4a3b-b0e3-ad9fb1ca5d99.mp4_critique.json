    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a camera positioned above a person with a parachute, who is located in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. In the background, clouds are visible at the bottom of the frame. The person and parachute ascend rapidly, moving from the center towards the upper center and receding further into the background, causing the shot to transition into an extreme wide shot. Simultaneously, the camera's perspective shifts to a position below the subject, looking up as they ascend, and the clouds move down and out of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, whose gender is not discernible, is suspended in the air beneath an open parachute. The individual is wearing a dark, full-body jumpsuit and dark footwear. The parachute, a ram-air canopy, is yellow and black. It is connected to the person's harness by long, white suspension lines.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor daytime scene, a person ascends rapidly and unsteadily through a vast blue sky. Initially, white clouds are positioned in the upper part of the frame, but as the camera tilts upward, the clouds shift to the lower part and eventually disappear from view. The individual, clad in a dark full-body suit, is suspended by long white lines connected to a yellow and black parachute.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to below the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot showing a cyclist riding along a city street, positioned in the lower right of the frame and occupying the foreground. Tall buildings line the left side of the frame in the background, while parked cars are visible in the middle ground along the bottom edge. The cyclist moves steadily from the lower right toward the center, and the camera remains at street level, parallel to the cyclist’s height. As the cyclist approaches the center, the shot smoothly transitions to a close-up, focusing on the cyclist’s upper body and face, now centered in the frame and still in the foreground. The buildings and cars become blurred in the background, and the camera maintains its position at the cyclist’s height throughout the sequence.",
