    "pre_caption": "In a static, close-up shot filmed from directly above, three hands are arranged in a triangular formation on a wooden surface in the middle ground. One hand is positioned at the top left of the frame, a second is at the top right, and a third is at the bottom center. All three hands are oriented toward the center of the frame, with their fingers nearly touching. The entire composition is tightly framed by a dark vignette, which places the hands and the central part of the wooden table in a focused circle of light.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Three hands are arranged in a triangular formation on a dark, wood-grained surface, all pointing toward the center. The hand at the upper-center left, which appears to be a man's, has a medium skin tone, a black tattoo covering the forearm, and wears a ring with a digitally colored green hue and a white symbol. The hand at the upper-center right, likely a woman's, also has a medium skin tone, colorful bracelets on the wrist, and wears a ring with a digitally colored red hue and a white symbol. Positioned at the bottom center is a third, more slender hand with a light skin tone that appears somewhat grimy, wearing a ring with a digitally colored light hue and a dark symbol.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit setting, three hands are positioned on a dark, textured wooden surface. The scene is viewed from directly above, showing two hands at the upper portion and one at the lower portion, forming a triangular arrangement. The hand at the upper-center left, with tattoos visible on the forearm, wears a ring with a green, gem-shaped icon. The hand at the upper-center right, adorned with colorful bracelets, wears a red ring with three white arrows on it. The hand at the lower center wears a white ring with a dark icon resembling the letter 'N' in a cube. The lighting is focused on the hands, creating a strong contrast with the surrounding darkness and highlighting the grain of the wood.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

A large potted plant is placed in the center background, partially obscured by the subjects. The camera remains stationary as both individuals turn slightly toward each other, while the plant stays fixed in the background. The shot is evenly lit, with no visible vignetting or spotlight effect, and the bench extends horizontally across the lower portion of the frame.",
