    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is framed from a worm's-eye view, looking directly up the center of a square spiral stairwell, creating a composition of concentric squares that recede from the foreground toward the center of the frame. The video begins with a slight rotational blur that quickly resolves into a stable image. People are positioned on multiple levels, leaning over the railings on all four sides of the opening. In the foreground, a person occupies the bottom of the frame. On the next level up, which forms the first visible square, people are positioned at the top, bottom, left, and right. This pattern repeats on successively higher levels, with the figures and railings appearing smaller and positioned closer to the center of the frame as they recede into the middle ground and background. The camera is positioned below all the subjects and remains static after the initial stabilization.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A diverse group of young men and women with fair skin are positioned on the landings of a multi-level, square staircase. Their hairstyles vary, with some having very short crew cuts and others sporting long slicked-back hair. Each person is dressed in a gray coat of varying shades, cinched with a black waist belt. They all look directly at the camera, creating a striking visual pattern that draws the viewer's eye upward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a worm's eye view looking directly up from the bottom of a stairwell, the scene is set within a multi-story building. The architecture features a square spiral staircase, creating a visual effect of concentric, receding squares against the white walls and ceilings. Dark metal railings with a simple, repeating scrollwork pattern frame each level, enhancing the symmetrical composition. On various floors, people dressed in muted, neutral-colored attire are positioned leaning over the railings, looking down into the central open space. The scene, which begins with a slight motion blur, sharpens to reveal the stark, repeating geometry of the interior.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "This medium close-up shot is framed from a high angle, looking down at a circular fountain located in the center of a public plaza. The fountain occupies the center of the frame in the foreground, with water jets forming arcs that reach toward the top and sides of the image. Around the fountain, several pigeons are scattered, mostly positioned at the bottom left and bottom right of the frame in the middle ground. In the background, a group of children is visible near the top edge, running from left to right. The camera remains stationary above the scene, maintaining a consistent height well above all subjects. There are no significant changes in shot size or subject position throughout the video.",
