    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot from a low-angle perspective, capturing a person holding a large lobster in the center of the frame, submerged in the middle ground of the underwater scene. The camera then moves vertically upwards, breaking the surface of the water. The shot transitions to a medium shot at the subject's level, where the person is now in the center-middle ground, partially above the water. They hold the lobster up, positioning it in the foreground so its underside fills the bottom of the frame. The surrounding sea occupies the middle ground, and a distant coastline stretches across the horizon in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man in a blue and white patterned wetsuit is in the ocean, holding a very large spiny lobster. The man wears a black diving mask with a camera attached to it and a snorkel. He also has a black belt that holds several objects. The lobster is reddish-brown and orange with a segmented body, a wide fan-like tail, and long, thin antennae. The man is shown both underwater and at the surface, holding the lobster with both hands. When he surfaces, he holds the lobster up, displaying its lighter-colored underside and legs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene transitions from a sunlit, underwater perspective in clear blue water to the surface of a choppy, bluish-turquoise sea. A person wearing a blue and white patterned wetsuit and a black snorkel mask is partially submerged, holding a large, reddish-brown spiny lobster. As the person emerges from the water, a low-lying, arid coastline appears on the right side of the horizon under a bright, clear sky, but it goes out of view as the camera pans and moves.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The camera slowly pans to the left, revealing a small dog sitting at the person's feet in the bottom left foreground. As the camera continues to move, the person steps toward the right side of the frame, now occupying the center-right middle ground, while the dog remains stationary. In the background, a row of palm trees stretches across the top of the frame from left to right. The camera remains above the subjects’ eye level throughout, and no significant changes in shot size occur. The ocean is not visible, and the scene remains entirely on land with no water elements present.",
