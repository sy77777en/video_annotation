    "pre_caption": "A full shot frames a man standing in the center of the middle ground on a wooden stage. In the foreground, the silhouettes of an audience occupy the bottom of the frame. Behind the man, in the middle ground, a large \"TEDxRyersonU\" sign is positioned in the center-right of the frame. Further back, a city skyline silhouette forms the background. The camera is positioned at the man's level. The man initially stands in the center, gesturing with his hands, then walks towards the right side of the stage, moving across the middle ground, before turning and walking back toward the center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark-skinned man with a bald head and short, dark hair on the sides is the central focus, standing on a wooden stage and giving a presentation. He is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved button-down shirt and dark trousers. Throughout the video, he gestures with his hands and walks around the stage as he speaks. Behind him, large red and white letters spell out \"TEDxRyersonU.\" In the background, a dark silhouette of a city skyline is illuminated by blue lights. In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of an audience can be seen sitting and watching the speaker.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene unfolds on a wooden stage within a dark auditorium. In the background, a large sign with red and white letters spelling \"TEDxRyersonU\" stands prominently. Behind this sign, a stylized silhouette of a city skyline, featuring a tall, distinctive tower, is backlit with blue light against a black backdrop. The stage is dimly lit, with focused lighting on the central area. In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of an audience are seated, facing the stage.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

On the right side of the middle ground, a large potted plant is visible, with its leaves extending upward toward the top right corner. In the background, a bookshelf filled with books and small decorative objects spans the width of the frame. The camera is positioned slightly above the woman’s eye level, angled downward. Throughout the shot, the woman remains seated and occasionally writes in a notebook, while the plant and bookshelf remain stationary. There are no significant changes in shot size or subject position during the video.",
