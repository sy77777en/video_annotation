    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a shot framing a woman from her head to her shoulders, positioned in the bottom center of the frame against a vast blue sky that serves as the background. The camera then tilts downward, revealing her entire upper body and establishing her as a giant figure standing in the middle ground amidst rolling, dry hills that enter the frame from the bottom. In the final composition, the woman remains centrally located, while the foreground at the bottom of the frame is populated with miniature elements, including a swing set on the bottom left, a car with balloons on the bottom right, and tiny figures scattered across the landscape. The camera is positioned at the woman's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with short, dark hair styled in finger waves on the side and middle of her forehead stands looking down and to her left. She has a light complexion and wears a beige bra top, a single long white glove with a diamond pattern on her left arm, while the other arm is invisible due to the perspective, and a piece of patterned fabric wrapped around her waist. As the scene reveals more, it becomes clear she is a giant, towering over a miniature landscape of dry, rolling hills. On the ground below her, tiny figures of people are scattered about, along with miniature objects including a swing set and a car with a bunch of colorful balloons tied to its rear.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a surreal outdoor scene, a giant person with short, dark hair stands amidst a landscape of dry, golden-brown rolling hills under a vast, clear blue sky. As the perspective tilts down, miniature objects and figures become visible at the base of the hills, including a playground slide, a swing set, and a small car with colorful balloons tied to it, establishing the immense scale of the central figure against the arid terrain.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: Initially, the camera frames a woman from her head to her shoulders. Gradually tilting downward, the shot fully reveals her upper body, while at the bottom of the frame, mounds of earth and a panoramic view of the ground, where crowds of people, much smaller than the woman, are moving about, come into view.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a man shown from the waist up, positioned in the top right corner of the frame, with a dense forest filling the background. The camera slowly pans to the left, bringing a large wooden cabin into view in the middle ground, occupying the center of the frame. In the final composition, the man stands near the top right, while the foreground at the bottom of the frame features a small pond on the bottom left and a bicycle leaning against a tree on the bottom right. Several birds are visible in the background sky. The camera remains slightly above the man’s eye level throughout the shot.",
