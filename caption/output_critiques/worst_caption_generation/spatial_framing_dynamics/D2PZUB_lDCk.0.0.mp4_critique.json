    "pre_caption": "The scene is captured from a low-angle perspective, looking across a shimmering, undulating surface of golden particles that occupies the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. A bright, concentrated light source is positioned in the center of the frame, at the horizon line in the middle ground. From this central area and across the surface, numerous thin, vertical lines of light continuously rise from the middle ground toward the top of the frame, fading at various heights. The entire space, from the foreground to the dark background, is populated with smaller, drifting golden particles, which create a sense of depth as they float throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features an abstract, animated scene with a dark background. The lower portion is a wavy, undulating surface composed of countless tiny, glittering golden particles, resembling a shimmering sea or desert dunes. From this surface, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise upwards, each culminating in a small, bright point of light. The space above the wavy surface is filled with a multitude of smaller, floating golden particles that sparkle and drift. A bright, concentrated source of golden light emanates from the center of the horizon line, where the particle landscape meets the dark background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An abstract scene is set against a dark background, featuring a shimmering, golden surface at the bottom composed of countless tiny particles. This surface undulates gently, resembling calm waves on a sea of light. A bright, concentrated source of golden light glows at the center of the horizon. From this glowing surface, thin, vertical lines of golden light and smaller particles rise upwards, varying in length and brightness. Additional golden specks of light float and drift throughout the entire space, creating a sparkling atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "bad_caption": "A medium shot frames a single large blue sphere positioned in the top right of the frame, occupying the foreground. Several smaller red cubes are scattered along the bottom edge in the middle ground, with a few partially overlapping the sphere. In the background, a faint grid pattern stretches across the entire scene, visible mostly in the left and center portions of the frame. The camera is angled slightly above the main sphere, looking down at the arrangement. No significant movement or transitions occur during the shot.",
