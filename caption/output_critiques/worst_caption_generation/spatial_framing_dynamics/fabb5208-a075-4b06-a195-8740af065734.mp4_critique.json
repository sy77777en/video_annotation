    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot begins with the camera positioned at the level of the pool table's surface. A red 15-ball is located in the center of the frame in the middle ground, with a blurred pocket in the bottom-center foreground and other out-of-focus balls in the left background. A white cue ball travels from the background to strike the 15-ball, sending it moving from the middle ground directly into the foreground pocket at the bottom of the frame, where it exits the shot. Following the collision, the cue ball continues to roll forward through the center of the frame. The camera's perspective then changes to a slightly higher angle, looking down on the cue ball as it slows in the middle ground, with another blurred ball now visible in the bottom-right foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video centers on the middle of the pool table, highlighting the solid red billiard ball with the black number \"15\" on a white circular patch. A player strikes the off-white cue ball, which hits the 15 ball, sending it directly into the pocket nearest to the camera and out of view. After the impact, the cue ball continues to roll slowly forward across the green felt surface. In the background and foreground, other out-of-focus billiard balls are present, including a blue and white striped ball and a solid green ball.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting with warm lighting, a game unfolds on a green felt pool table. Initially, a maroon and white striped ball, marked with the number 15, is in the middle ground. The white cue ball strikes the 15-ball, sending it rolling into the foreground and eventually into the pocket closest to the camera. After the collision, the white cue ball continues to roll slowly forward without stopping, while other out-of-focus balls are scattered in the background, where a person's hand and a pool cue are faintly visible.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a billiard table where the white ball strikes the red ball, causing the red ball to fall into the pocket. Overall, it is a wide shot of the ball.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to above the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "This medium shot starts with the camera positioned slightly above a chessboard, capturing most of the board in the lower half of the frame. A black knight is placed near the top right foreground, while a white queen is in the center background. Several pawns are scattered along the left and right edges in the middle ground. The camera remains stationary as a hand enters from the left side, moving a white bishop diagonally from the bottom left foreground toward the top right background, passing in front of the black knight. The camera’s height stays above the chessboard throughout, providing a clear overhead perspective of the pieces and their arrangement. No significant changes in shot size or camera angle occur during the scene.",
