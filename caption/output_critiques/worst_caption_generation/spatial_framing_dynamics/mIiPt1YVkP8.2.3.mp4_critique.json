    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a white airplane in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground against a black background, with a dark, flat surface occupying the foreground at the bottom. The airplane flies directly toward the camera, steadily increasing in size. As it moves from the middle ground into the foreground, the shot transitions into a full shot, and the camera's perspective becomes a low angle, looking up from below at the approaching aircraft.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white, twin-engine passenger jet is shown against a solid black background. Initially, the camera is positioned at a level angle, looking straight ahead, but it transitions to a low angle, looking up from below, as the aircraft approaches. The plane has its landing gear extended and appears to be flying directly toward the viewer, gradually increasing in size. The dim lighting casts the plane in a cool, grayish-white tone.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a nighttime setting against a solid black background, a white passenger airplane is seen from a head-on perspective. The aircraft, with its landing gear deployed, flies directly toward the camera, gradually increasing in size. The plane is illuminated from the front, making it the sole focus in the dark, minimalist environment. A dark, flat surface is visible at the bottom of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",

The car is positioned at a slight angle, with its front facing toward the left edge of the frame. A person stands next to the car on the left, in the middle ground, partially visible from the waist up. The camera is at eye level with the person, and both the car and the person remain stationary throughout the shot. No significant movement or change in shot size occurs during the video.",
