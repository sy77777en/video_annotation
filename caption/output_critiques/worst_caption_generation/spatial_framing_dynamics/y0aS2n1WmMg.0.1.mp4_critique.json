    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium-full shot of a person in the center foreground, with their back to the camera. A two-story house occupies the middle ground and background, filling the frame from top to bottom. A low stone wall and garden elements are situated in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the top left, a white cat-shaped craft is visible on a windowsill in the background. The person walks from the foreground toward the center of the frame, becoming smaller as they approach the front door in the middle ground. As they move, the shot effectively becomes a wide shot of the house, with the person occupying a small central portion. A satellite dish is positioned in the middle ground to the left of the front door. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, seen from behind, walks toward the front door of a two-story house. He has dark brown hair tied up in a bun and is dressed in a tan bomber jacket, a black shirt, and dark pants. In the upper left window, a white cat-shaped craft is visible, placed on the windowsill and looking out.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors during the day, in front of a two-story terraced house under an overcast sky. The building's facade consists of a brick ground floor and an upper level clad in scalloped, brownish-grey tiles. The windows and front door are white, with some windows partially obscured by blinds. Initially, the small, unkempt front garden with a low stone wall appears in the midground, but as a person wearing a brown jacket moves away from the camera towards the house, the garden transitions into the foreground. A satellite dish is mounted on the brick wall beside the entrance. A craft shaped like a white cat is positioned on the windowsill of an upstairs window.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person walking toward a building. It begins with a medium-full shot of the person. As the person approaches the building, their full body becomes visible but occupies only a small portion of the frame, with more space given to a wide shot of the building.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot of a large orange tabby cat sitting at the center of the foreground, facing the camera. Behind the cat, a single-story brick garage stretches across the background, occupying most of the frame horizontally. To the right side of the frame in the middle ground, a blue bicycle leans against a wooden fence, while a small potted plant is visible at the bottom left in the foreground. The camera is positioned at the cat’s eye level. As the scene progresses, the cat stands up and walks toward the left edge of the frame, moving from the center foreground to the left middle ground, while the camera slowly pans right to follow the movement of a red ball rolling from the bottom right toward the center. No other subjects enter or exit the frame during the shot.",
