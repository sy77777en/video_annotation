    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a low angle, showing a man in the top center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground beneath a rocky overhang that occupies the top foreground. As the man falls downward, the scene cuts to a high-angle, top-down wide shot, placing the camera above him. In this new perspective, the man is in the bottom center of the frame, descending toward the water that fills the middle ground and background. A small section of the cliff is visible in the bottom right foreground. The man continues to fall toward the bottom center of the frame, splashing into the water and disappearing from view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a light complexion and short, dark hair is shown falling through the air. He is shirtless and wears dark-colored shorts that reach his knees. His arms are extended out to his sides as he descends toward the dark water below. He enters the water, creating a large white splash, and then disappears from view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds during the day at a rugged, beige-colored cliff overlooking a deep, dark blue body of water. A person wearing dark shorts jumps from beneath a rocky overhang. The video effectively utilizes dynamic camera angles, starting with a low-angle shot that looks up from below, and then transitioning to a high-angle, top-down perspective. This shift in camera motion enhances the viewer's experience by providing a comprehensive view of the jump and the surrounding scenery. The person falls towards the water and disappears beneath the surface in a large white splash.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a wide shot of a person diving into the water. As he enters the water, he disappears beneath the surface.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject and then changes to above the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot at eye level, showing a woman standing in the bottom left of the frame, holding a large umbrella. She is positioned in the foreground, while a row of bicycles lines the middle ground across the center and right side of the frame. The background features a brick wall stretching horizontally. As the scene progresses, the camera slowly pans upward and to the right, shifting to a high-angle view that places the woman in the top right corner, now partially obscured by the umbrella. The bicycles remain visible in the middle ground, but the brick wall is replaced by a row of trees in the background. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a height slightly above the woman's head, emphasizing her position relative to the other elements.",
