    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a top-down perspective, the scene is framed statically. A large wooden platform holding various items occupies the middle ground on the left side of the frame. To its right, a cavern environment fills the center and right portions of the frame. A small character is positioned in the center of the frame on a patch of land between the platform and the cavern wall. Throughout the video, the character moves slightly up and down within this central area, sequentially placing wooden fence pieces to construct a small enclosure. Other elements include glowing plants in the lower-center middle ground and a user interface overlaid in the foreground, with components in the top-left, top-right, bottom-center, and bottom-right corners. The camera's position and the overall framing remain fixed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a top-down, pixel-art scene, a character with black hair, a red shirt, and blue pants stands on brown land above a patch of green land in a dimly lit cavern. To the left is a large wooden platform holding numerous items, including rows of green chests, several wooden chests, a blue bed, a furnace, an anvil, and other crafting stations, all lit by torches. The green land below features pink, orange, and blue glowing plants. The character constructs a wooden fence piece by piece near the bridge leading to the platform. The user interface displays a health bar in the top left, a minimap in the top right, an inventory hotbar at the bottom of the screen, and an action controller in the bottom right corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows a pixel-art scene set in a dark, torch-lit cavern, where the camera is placed above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides. On the left, a large, square wooden platform built over dark water is furnished with green storage chests, workbenches, a furnace, and a blue bed. To the right of the platform is the natural cave environment, featuring brown earth, patches of green moss, rock formations, and mushrooms, with a small garden of glowing pink, blue, and orange plants in the lower area. A small character with black hair starts and remains on the brown earth while constructing a wooden fence on the land. Overlaying the scene is a heads-up display (HUD) with health and status bars in the top-left, a mini-map in the top-right, an inventory hotbar at the bottom-center, and controller button prompts in the bottom-right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",

On the left side of the frame, a small fountain is visible in the foreground, while a row of tall sunflowers lines the background along the top edge. A person wearing a red jacket stands at the bottom right, partially obscured by the statue, and remains stationary throughout the video. The camera remains fixed at a position below the statue’s base, looking upward. No significant movement or transitions occur during the scene. A digital clock is overlaid in the top-center, and a weather icon appears in the bottom-left corner.",
