    "pre_caption": "A full shot frames a vintage poster positioned in the center-left of the frame, affixed to a grey brick wall in the middle ground. To the right, in the background, several dark barrels stand on a pallet next to a dark doorway. The camera remains static and at the subject's level throughout the shot. Sequentially, glowing white text appears in the middle ground to the right of the poster, partially overlaying the background doorway. The text, which reads \"Chemistry yields bread prosperity beauty,\" eventually transitions from a glowing to a non-glowing state while maintaining its position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A vintage blue poster is affixed to a grey brick wall. At the top of the poster, the word \"Chemie\" is written in large yellow, white, and red letters. Below this, three ovals contain German text: a yellow oval with \"gibt Brot,\" a light blue oval with \"Wohlstand,\" and a red oval with \"Schönheit.\" Underneath the ovals is a stylized white and light blue illustration of a chemical apparatus, featuring a flask and condenser. At the bottom of the poster, black text reads, \"1. Projektierungskonferenz der chemischen Industrie in Leuna am 3. November 1959.\" To the right of the poster, glowing white text appears, translating the German phrases into \"Chemistry yields bread, prosperity, beauty,\" and eventually becomes non-glowing. In the middle ground to the right, several dark, cylindrical barrels are positioned on a wooden pallet against the background wall and door.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting with grey cinder block walls, a vintage German poster is prominently displayed. The blue poster features the title \"Chemie\" in large white, yellow, and red letters above three ovals containing the German words \"gibt Brot,\" \"Wohlstand,\" and \"Schönheit.\" Positioned at the lower left of the three ovals is a stylized illustration of chemical apparatus. Text at the bottom references a 1959 conference in Leuna. To the right of the poster, the scene extends into a darker area with a doorway and several large barrels on a pallet. An overlay of glowing white text appears sequentially to the right of the poster, translating the German slogans into English as \"Chemistry yields bread prosperity beauty,\" and eventually loses its glow. In the lower left corner of the frame, there is an overlay of white text reading \"[14];@hdg_museen/X.com.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a large aquarium tank positioned at the right side of the frame in the foreground, filled with colorful fish swimming near the glass. To the left in the middle ground, a tall potted plant stands against a white tiled wall. The camera slowly pans upward and to the left, causing the aquarium to move toward the bottom right of the frame while the plant shifts closer to the center. In the background, a window with closed blinds is visible at the top left. Overlaid blue text appears above the aquarium, reading \"Physics powers the ocean world,\" and remains stationary as the camera moves, with no change in its appearance. The camera is positioned at eye level with the aquarium throughout the shot.",
