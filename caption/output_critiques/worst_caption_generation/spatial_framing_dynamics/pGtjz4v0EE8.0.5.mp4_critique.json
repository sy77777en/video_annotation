    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of a canal in Venice. Initially, the frame is centered on a prominent yellow hotel in the middle ground, with the canal's water and wooden mooring poles occupying the foreground at the bottom. Several gondolas are positioned in the middle ground on both the left and right sides of the frame. The camera then pans from right to left, causing the initial buildings to move out of the frame to the right. This movement reveals a new set of ornate yellow and orange buildings that enter from the left and fill the center of the frame. During the pan, a water bus enters from the right and moves left across the middle ground. The camera maintains a slightly elevated position, looking across the water toward the buildings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a bright and sunny cityscape scenery shot along a canal in Venice, Italy. The view pans across a row of historic, multi-story buildings painted in warm shades of yellow and orange, featuring terracotta tile roofs, numerous windows, and balconies. The greenish water of the canal is dotted with traditional black gondolas and a larger yellow and black water bus carrying passengers, all navigating between wooden mooring poles. Additionally, a yellow speedboat and a white speedboat appear in the frame. The shot does not have a single main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall environment and bustling atmosphere of the iconic city. The composition is designed to convey a sense of place and scale, highlighting the unique relationship between the architecture and the waterway.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A daytime view of the Grand Canal in Venice showcases the city's distinctive architecture under a clear blue sky. Multi-story buildings in shades of yellow, orange, and white, featuring terracotta tile roofs, balconies, and arched windows, line the waterway. One prominent yellow building is marked with the name \"REGINA.\" The greenish water of the canal is dotted with wooden mooring poles. Several black gondolas are docked along the banks, while others, along with a larger water bus and speedboats, navigate the canal with passengers. Ornate street lamps are positioned along the canal's edge.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "bad_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot focused on a bustling city street, where a large red double-decker bus occupies the center of the frame in the foreground. Pedestrians are visible on the left and right edges of the frame, walking along the sidewalks in the middle ground. Several street vendors with colorful umbrellas are positioned at the bottom right and bottom left corners in the foreground. The camera is positioned at street level, matching the height of the bus and pedestrians. As the scene progresses, the camera tilts upward, shifting the focus to a tall glass skyscraper that rises from the center to the top of the frame in the background, while the bus and pedestrians gradually move out of view at the bottom. No significant lateral movement occurs, but the vertical tilt changes the spatial emphasis from the street scene to the towering building above.",
