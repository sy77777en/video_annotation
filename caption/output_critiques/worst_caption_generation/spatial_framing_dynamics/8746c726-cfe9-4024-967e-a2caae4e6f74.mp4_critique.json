    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a group of men and gift boxes are clustered in the middle ground, initially filling the center of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, executes a rapid and continuous barrel roll, causing the entire scene to spin. This rotation makes the subjects and the gift boxes, some of which are tossed in the air, chaotically shift their positions across the frame, moving from top to bottom and side to side. Throughout the spin, the group remains the central focus, while the checkerboard floor and ceiling lights alternately occupy the top and bottom of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of young men are gathered in a chaotic room. They are dressed in bright red outfits, with some wearing jackets and others in full suits trimmed with white fur, resembling Santa Claus costumes. The men, who appear to be young adults with hairstyles ranging from blond to dark brown, are shown with open mouths, as if chatting or expressing surprise. Scattered among them and held in their hands are numerous gift-wrapped boxes of various sizes. The presents are wrapped in different papers, including green with white polka dots and a plain white box tied with a red ribbon.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a room with a black-and-white checkerboard floor, vibrant artificial light rapidly shifts between magenta, purple, yellow, and cyan hues. Thin light fixtures line the edges of the ceiling. Gift-wrapped boxes with varied patterns and ribbons are scattered around the room. Some of these boxes are held by men dressed in red outfits, while others are tossed through the air by some of the men. The camera moves erratically, smoothly rolling to capture the energetic scene from level-angle and rotating perspectives.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a single woman stands near a large window on the right side of the frame, occupying the foreground. Several potted plants are arranged along the bottom left and center, extending into the middle ground. The camera is positioned slightly above the woman's eye level, angling downward. As the scene progresses, the woman slowly walks from right to left, passing behind the plants, while sunlight streams in from the window, casting shadows across the floor. No significant changes in shot size occur, and the camera remains stationary throughout the video.",
