    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man running, positioned in the center of the frame and occupying the foreground. The camera, positioned above him, tracks his movement across a field of dry grass that extends into the background, creating a strong horizontal motion blur. As the shot progresses, the framing transitions to a full shot, showing more of the man's body while he remains in the center of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a light to medium skin tone, short dark hair, and a dark mustache is shown in the act of running. He wears a light-colored, long-sleeved jacket with a small logo on the chest, along with dark shorts. His body is angled forward, and he has an open-mouthed expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a vast, open landscape under daylight, a person runs across a field of dry, yellowish-brown grass. The camera moves alongside the runner, creating a pronounced horizontal motion blur in the background that streaks the terrain. The runner wears a light-colored, long-sleeved jacket and dark shorts.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot of a woman sitting at a desk, positioned in the center foreground of the frame. The camera is at eye level with her, capturing her from the shoulders up as she types on a laptop. To her right in the middle ground, a potted plant is partially visible along the edge of the frame, while a window occupies the background on the left side. As the scene progresses, the camera slowly zooms out to a medium shot, revealing more of the desk and a stack of books on the bottom right. The woman remains centrally framed throughout, with no significant movement from her or the other elements.",
