    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, with a grayish-green Nissan GT-R positioned in the center-right of the frame and a partially visible black sports car on the left, both in the middle ground. White parking lines and dark asphalt fill the foreground. The camera, positioned at a low angle level with the cars, slowly pushes in toward the GT-R. This movement causes the framing to tighten, transitioning into a full shot where the GT-R dominates the composition. As the camera advances, the black car on the left becomes more cropped by the frame's edge. Throughout the shot, the garage walls and ceiling remain in the background, with orange bollards visible in the middle ground to the right of the GT-R.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a heavily modified, metallic grayish-green Nissan GT-R parked neatly within the parking lines in an indoor garage. The car is extremely low to the ground and features a widebody kit with prominent, flared fenders. It has an aggressive front bumper with a large black splitter and canards, and a large wing is visible at the rear. The wheels are dark grey, multi-spoked, and have a deep-dish design. On the left side of the frame, the front half of a dark red sports car, likely a Mazda RX-7, is partially visible, also parked.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in an indoor parking garage under cool, green-tinted artificial lighting. A metallic grayish-green, heavily modified Nissan GTR with a widebody kit and a large rear wing is parked in a space, positioned very low to the ground. On the left side of the frame, the front part of a dark red sports car is visible. Both vehicles have Japanese license plates. The floor is dark gray asphalt, appearing somewhat dark green due to the lighting, with white painted parking lines and directional arrows. The background features white walls, exposed pipes and conduits on the ceiling, and several orange and white traffic bollards. The camera slowly pushes in toward the grayish-green GTR.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot showing a blue pickup truck parked diagonally across the right side of the frame in the foreground, with a white delivery van partially visible on the far left in the background. The camera is positioned slightly above the vehicles, angling downward. As the camera slowly pans to the left, the pickup truck moves out of the frame while the delivery van becomes more prominent, eventually occupying the center of the shot. In the middle ground, a row of yellow traffic cones lines the bottom edge of the frame. The background features a row of tall green hedges stretching across the top of the image. Throughout the shot, the camera maintains its elevated height relative to the vehicles.",
