    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, bird's-eye perspective, a full shot captures two men with their bicycles in the middle ground, positioned centrally on a paved surface. One man stands in the upper-center of the frame, over a light blue bicycle, extending his hand downward. Positioned directly below him in the lower-center, a second man sits on a red bicycle and reaches his hand upward, with their hands meeting near the frame's center. The paved ground, marked by two faint yellow lines running diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right, occupies the entire background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From an overhead perspective, a man with dark skin, wearing a light-colored baseball cap backward, a black jacket over a blue collared shirt, and dark pants, stands over a light blue and white BMX-style bicycle. He is smiling and extending his left hand toward a second man who is seated on a red and black BMX-style bicycle. The seated man, wearing a black hooded sweatshirt with the hood up, a black face covering, and grey pants, raises his right hand in a gesture resembling a fist bump.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The camera starts at a high angle and transitions to a bird’s-eye view before moving upward to an upside-down high angle. The scene unfolds on a wide expanse of worn, light-colored pavement marked with two parallel, faded yellow lines running diagonally. The diffuse daytime lighting casts soft shadows on the textured concrete surface. Centrally positioned are two individuals with their BMX-style bicycles, one blue and white and the other red and black, interacting in the middle of the paved area.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

To her left in the middle ground, a small brown dog sits near a blue park bench, positioned at the center of the frame. The camera slowly tilts upward, bringing the woman into the center background while the dog moves to the lower-left foreground. The woman raises her umbrella above her head, and the dog jumps onto the bench. The camera remains below the subjects’ eye level throughout. In the background, a row of tall sunflowers stretches horizontally across the top of the frame. No other notable movement or transition occurs.",
