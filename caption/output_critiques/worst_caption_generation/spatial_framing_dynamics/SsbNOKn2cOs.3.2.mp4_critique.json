    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot from a high-angle, bird's-eye perspective, a man is positioned in the top-center of the frame. He is suspended in the foreground, with a black rope extending from his position down through the center of the frame. The background is entirely occupied by a vast valley far below, with a winding path visible snaking from the top right towards the center of the scene. The camera and the subject remain relatively static, emphasizing the extreme depth between the man in the foreground and the valley floor in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a bird's-eye view, a young man with fair skin and short, light brown hair is seen suspended in the air. He wears a dark, short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants. His body is curled forward as he looks ahead, gripping a thick black rope with his right hand, while his other hand is not visible. Another person, bald and wearing a black top and a mask, is holding the man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye view, the scene looks directly down into a vast, green valley during the daytime. The landscape below is a mix of green and brown vegetation covering rolling hills, with some exposed rocky ground. A narrow, winding path or dry riverbed meanders across the valley floor. A thick black rope descends from the bottom left to the center-left of the view, with a person in dark clothing suspended from it, positioned high above the ground. Another individual, bald and wearing a black top and a mask, appears to be holding the person suspended from the rope. The overall color palette is muted under what appears to be an overcast sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

She is facing left, with a small dog sitting beside her in the bottom right foreground. A wooden bench stretches from the center to the left edge of the middle ground, partially obscured by tall grass. In the background, a row of colorful houses lines the top left to top center of the frame. The camera slowly tilts upward, shifting focus from the woman and dog to the rooftops, while the subjects remain stationary. The camera is positioned below the subjects’ eye level, emphasizing the height of the umbrella and the buildings behind.",
