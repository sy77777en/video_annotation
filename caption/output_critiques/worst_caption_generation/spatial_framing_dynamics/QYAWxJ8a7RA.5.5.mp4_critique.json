    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, static shot of a desolate town, captured from a low camera angle. The foreground is filled with dark, debris-strewn ground. In the middle ground, a single-story house occupies the center of the frame. To its right stands a utility pole. In the background, a larger building is visible on the left, and a clock tower rises behind the central house, all set against a backdrop of hazy hills that span the width of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a bleak landscape scenery shot of a desolate and abandoned town. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on creating a pervasive atmosphere of decay and emptiness, with the composition encouraging the viewer to take in the entire desolate environment. In the middle ground, a dark, single-story house with a broken window and a satellite dish sits on gravelly, debris-strewn ground. Behind it, a larger building and a prominent clock tower stand against a backdrop of hazy hills, while a lone utility pole punctuates the sky. Fine particles, resembling dust or ash, drift through the air, enhancing the scene's post-apocalyptic and somber tone under an overcast sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a desolate, abandoned town under a bright, overcast sky. In the middle ground, a single-story house with dark shingled siding and a broken window sits on ground covered with dark debris. A wooden utility pole stands behind the house on the right side, and a satellite dish is mounted on its roof. In the background, a larger, industrial-style building and a clock tower with a domed top are set against barren, rolling hills. Small particles, resembling ash or dust, drift through the air, and the scene is framed with a dark vignette.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

The foreground shows a paved walkway stretching across the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a group of people is seated on benches positioned along the right side, while a large fountain occupies the center. To the left in the background, several tall palm trees are visible, and a playground structure appears near the top left corner. The camera remains above the subjects’ eye level throughout, maintaining a consistent height as it pans.",
