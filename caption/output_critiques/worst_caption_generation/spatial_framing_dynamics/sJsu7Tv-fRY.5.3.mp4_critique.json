    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, two individuals are visible in the middle ground, framed within a central window of a building. They start on the right side of this window and walk horizontally to the left, remaining in the center of the overall frame. The building's facade occupies the entire scene, with a balcony situated at the top of the frame. In the foreground, foliage is visible in the bottom-right and bottom-left corners. The camera is positioned above the subjects and remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two individuals are visible walking indoors toward the left side of the frame, seen through a large window with dark vertical bars. One person is wearing a dark long-sleeved top and light brown pants, while the other is dressed in a white long-sleeved top.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A daytime, exterior shot focuses on the upper level of a light-colored building with a grainy, vintage film quality. The facade features a row of deeply recessed, dark windows separated by thick, dark vertical bars. Above the windows, a balcony is enclosed by a solid railing with narrow vertical slits. In the bottom-right corner of the frame, the leaves of a green bush are visible against the building's exterior, while additional leaves enter from the bottom-left corner and move towards the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

The subject is positioned at eye level with the camera, occupying most of the vertical space in the frame.

On the left side of the frame, a bicycle is partially visible in the middle ground, while a bench appears on the right in the background.
