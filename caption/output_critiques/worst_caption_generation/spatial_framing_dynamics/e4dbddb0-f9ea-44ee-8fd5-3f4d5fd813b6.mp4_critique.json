    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a blurry medium close-up of a man in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The shot then pulls into sharp focus while simultaneously tightening to a close-up, keeping the man centered. In the final framing, the man's head and shoulders occupy the center, with a black tablet he is holding visible in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. Out-of-focus lights are visible in the background. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, light-skinned man with short, dark brown hair and a trimmed beard and mustache is shown in a close-up. He wears a white lab coat over a blue shirt with a Henley-style collar. A black earpiece is visible in his right ear. He holds a black tablet in his hands and looks down at it with a concentrated expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space, characterized by strong blue and teal lighting that casts a cool tone over the environment. The dark, out-of-focus background features circular bokeh lights in white and green. A man in a white lab coat over a blue shirt stands in the space, holding and looking at a black rectangular tablet. The shot begins with a soft, blurry view before pulling into a sharp focus on the man.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot showing two women seated side by side on a bench, positioned in the lower right of the frame and occupying the foreground. A large window fills the background, stretching across the top and left side of the frame, with trees visible outside in the middle ground. As the shot progresses, the camera slowly pans left, bringing the women toward the center while maintaining their position in the foreground. The camera is angled slightly above the subjects, looking down at them throughout the scene. No significant changes in shot size occur, and the spatial arrangement of the window and trees remains consistent as the camera moves.",
