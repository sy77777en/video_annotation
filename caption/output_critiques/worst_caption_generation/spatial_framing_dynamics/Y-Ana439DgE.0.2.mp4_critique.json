    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is captured from a high-angle perspective, looking down on the subjects. In the foreground, a large, dark gray, wing-like structure initially occupies the bottom left of the frame. A cylindrical spacecraft with an astronaut on its surface is positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, with the Earth's surface serving as the background. Throughout the shot, the foreground wing moves across the frame from the bottom left towards the bottom right. As this occurs, the midground spacecraft appears to move rightward, eventually becoming completely obscured behind the foreground structure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A cylindrical, multi-segmented spacecraft with a metallic exterior of silver and dark gray sections is visible in space. An astronaut in a white, bulky spacesuit is positioned on the top surface of the spacecraft, carrying a large white rectangular package on their back. In the foreground, a large, dark gray, wing-like structure with a tiled texture partially frames the scene. The spacecraft appears to move behind this structure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high orbital perspective, a planet's surface with green landmasses and scattered white clouds is visible below. In the foreground, a large, black, tiled fin, likely part of a spacecraft, occupies the lower portion of the view and gradually shifts from the lower-left to the lower-right. A separate, cylindrical space module with a metallic silver and dark grey finish is seen in the midground. This module is composed of several segments, and an astronaut in a white spacesuit is positioned on its exterior. The cylindrical module appears to drift rightward behind the foreground fin.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

A group of three people wearing business suits stands in the center of the frame in the middle ground, with a tall glass office building occupying the background. During the shot, the flag remains stationary, while the group of people gradually moves from the center toward the left side of the frame, eventually exiting out of view. The camera remains at waist height relative to the subjects throughout the video, with no significant changes in shot size or camera position.",
