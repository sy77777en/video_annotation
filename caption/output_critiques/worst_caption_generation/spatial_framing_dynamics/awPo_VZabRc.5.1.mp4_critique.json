    "pre_caption": "This 2D animation is presented as a static wide shot of a dark urban alley. A large building occupies the middle ground and background, extending from the center to the right side of the frame. In the middle ground, slightly to the right of center, a person lies on the ground at the base of this building, illuminated by a streetlamp positioned above them. At the beginning, an indistinct figure in the middle ground on the far right walks out of the frame. Subsequently, a wide beam of light enters from the bottom left foreground, travels horizontally across the scene, momentarily highlighting the person on the ground, and exits at the bottom right. The shot ends as it began, with the person remaining motionless in the middle ground under the streetlamp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In this 2D animation, a person wearing a dark coat, a white top, and dark pants lies motionless on their side on a sidewalk, facing the camera. At the beginning of the sequence, a dark, indistinct figure walks away and exits on the right. Subsequently, a dark-colored sedan with its bright headlights on drives into view from the left. The car's beam of light illuminates the person on the ground as it travels across the scene before disappearing to the right, leaving the first person still lying on the sidewalk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a hand-drawn, animated scene set at night, a dark urban alley is illuminated by a single, cool-toned streetlamp. The light shines on the facade of a multi-story, staggered gray building with a rough texture, which has several rectangular windows, two barred windows, and two doors. A person is lying on the ground at the base of the building. A wide beam of light, as if from a headlight, sweeps across the foreground from the left.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is a 2D animation. It starts with a wide shot of a city street: one person lies on the ground in front of a house, another walks out of the frame to the right, then a car enters from the left and drives to the right, and disappears from the frame. Finally, only that person remains lying motionless on the ground.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects:  It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",

A row of empty seats stretches across the middle ground from the left to the center of the frame, while a small dog sits upright on the far left seat, occupying the left-center foreground. In the upper right corner, a digital display panel is visible in the background, showing a sequence of changing numbers. At the start, a person standing in the center foreground briefly waves at the camera before stepping aside to the right. Shortly after, a paper airplane enters from the top left, glides diagonally downward across the scene, and lands on the empty seat beside the dog. The shot concludes with a slow pan upward, shifting the focus to the digital display panel as it fills more of the frame, with the camera positioned slightly below the subjects throughout.",
