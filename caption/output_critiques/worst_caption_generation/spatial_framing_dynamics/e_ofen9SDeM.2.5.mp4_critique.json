    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a person's arm extends from the top right of the frame into the center foreground. A large pile of small, brown rocks occupies the bottom right foreground, with a second, smaller pile situated in the center-left middle ground. The person's hand moves from the larger pile on the right, picks up a single rock, and then moves it toward the smaller pile on the left. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A detailed close-up shows a person's light-skinned, aged hand with visible veins, carefully picking up small, brown, round rocks and moving them from one pile to another on the muddy ground. The person's arm is covered by the sleeve of a light gray, knitted sweater, and the rocks are gathered in small mounds on the wet, uneven earth.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting on an overcast day, a person's hand, extending from the sleeve of a gray textured sweater, transfers small rocks from a larger pile to a smaller one on the damp, muddy ground. The scene features two distinct piles of stones, surrounded by small puddles and sparse patches of green vegetation.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

A bright red ball is placed in the top right background, partially obscured by a low wooden fence that runs horizontally across the upper third of the image. The dog remains stationary while a blue frisbee rolls from the center middle ground toward the bottom right foreground. The camera is positioned slightly above the dog's eye level, looking down at the scene.",
