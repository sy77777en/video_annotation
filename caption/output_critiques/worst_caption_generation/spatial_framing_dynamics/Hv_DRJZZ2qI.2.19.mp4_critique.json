    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a mountain biker is captured mid-air in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground as they jump across a large canyon gap. To the right of the biker's flight path, a blue flag and several spectators are visible on a ridge, also in the middle ground. As the biker travels from the center-right towards the left, the camera pans to follow their movement. This pan reveals another spectator in an orange shirt on a ledge in the left middle ground, watching as the biker lands on a dirt path in the center-left of the frame. The vast, rocky canyon fills the foreground and background throughout the shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a person on a mountain bike, captured mid-air while performing a jump across a wide gap in a rocky, canyon landscape. The biker is wearing a full-face helmet, a long-sleeved jersey that is dark blue with a red decoration on the right arm, a white decoration on the left arm, and a long light blue stripe running down the sides of both the jersey and the pants. The bicycle is dark in color. Several other people are visible in the scene, watching the event. As the camera pans, a man in a bright orange t-shirt and light-colored shorts appears on a ledge to the left, observing. Other spectators are scattered on different ledges in the background and below the biker. To the right of the biker's path, a large blue flag with a Red Bull logo is planted on a pole.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Set during the day, the scene unfolds in a vast, arid canyon with steep, reddish-brown rock formations and dusty terrain. Narrow dirt paths wind along the ledges and slopes, which are dotted with sparse, dry brush. A blue flag is planted on a ridge, and several people are positioned on various ledges throughout the canyon. The sequence captures a mountain biker launching off a ledge, soaring through the air across a wide gap, and landing smoothly on the other side, showcasing the entire thrilling jump.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot showing a group of hikers standing on a wooden bridge that spans a narrow river. The hikers are clustered toward the left side of the frame in the foreground, with one person leaning on the railing at the bottom left. In the middle ground, a red kayak is visible drifting from the right edge toward the center of the frame. The background features dense forest filling the upper half of the shot. As the camera tilts upward, the hikers remain stationary while the kayak moves closer to the center, and the treetops become more prominent in the upper right. The camera is positioned slightly above the subjects, looking down at the bridge and river throughout the scene.",
