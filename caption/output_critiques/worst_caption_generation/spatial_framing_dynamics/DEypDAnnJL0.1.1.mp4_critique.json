    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up, overhead shot where a person's arms and hands occupy the foreground, positioned in the right and center of the frame. The right hand, holding scissors, moves from the top center of the frame downwards, cutting the tape on a brown cardboard box located in the middle ground at the center of the scene. The person's left hand is stationary in the center, holding the box steady. In the middle ground at the top left, another open cardboard box is visible. The wooden floor serves as the background for the entire scene. The camera remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An overhead view shows a person with light skin, wearing a fluffy white sweater with puffy sleeves, opening a brown cardboard box on a wood-grain floor. The person's hands, which have yellow nail polish, are using a pair of black-handled scissors to cut through the white tape sealing the box. The top of the box has red text that reads, \"DO NOT OPEN WITH SHARP INSTRUMENT.\" To the left is another, partially open cardboard box with a shipping label and something black visible inside.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot captures a scene indoors on a light brown wooden floor, where a person is opening packages. The person, wearing a fluffy white sweater, sits on the ground with their knees bent and uses a black cutting tool to slice the white tape on a brown cardboard box. This box has red text printed on it reading, \"DO NOT OPEN WITH SHARP INSTRUMENT.\" The person's left hand, with yellow nail polish, holds the box steady. Another open cardboard box with shipping labels is visible nearby.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

To the left in the middle ground, a tall bookshelf filled with books extends vertically, while a small potted plant sits on the right in the background. The person raises their right arm from their side to above their head, waving, while their left arm remains at their hip. The camera remains at floor level, looking up at the subject, and there is no movement or transition in the shot.",
