    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a sprawling, futuristic cityscape, with the environment itself serving as the main focus. The scene is framed from a high angle, looking down and across the multi-layered metropolis that fills the entire frame and extends deep into the background, creating a strong sense of scale and depth. In the foreground, blurred structural elements on the left and the lower levels of the city establish the viewer's perspective. The middle ground is densely populated with dark architecture, platforms, and a central pathway leading into the distance, all adorned with numerous glowing neon signs across the left, right, and center. A large holographic screen displaying shifting faces is positioned in the right middle ground, while a prominent cascading blue light feature is also located on the right. The city's structures recede into the dark cavernous background. Throughout the shot, the camera performs a very slow and subtle push-in, moving forward into the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a sprawling, futuristic cityscape scenery shot, steeped in a dark, cyberpunk aesthetic. The environment itself is the central focus, with the shot emphasizing the immense scale and dense, technologically saturated atmosphere of the location rather than highlighting a specific subject. The vast, multi-layered metropolis appears to be built within a massive, dark cavern, illuminated by a dizzying array of glowing neon and holographic signs in vibrant yellows, greens, and blues that stand out against the dark, industrial architecture. These holographic displays project various images, including alien-like script and shifting faces, such as a large, green-skinned, red-eyed alien head and a more serene human-like face that alternates on a large screen to the right. Glowing blue energy curtains cascade down the sides of some structures, adding to the high-tech, moody ambiance of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A vast, multi-leveled futuristic city is situated within a massive, dark cavernous space at night. The dense, industrial architecture consists of dark, metallic structures, platforms, and walkways, all illuminated by a profusion of glowing neon signs in cyan, yellow, green, and red, which display non-English characters. Large, transparent holographic screens are integrated into the buildings, displaying flickering faces that shift between a green-skinned, bald alien-like creature with red eyes and a human face. A hazy atmosphere permeates the scene, diffusing the artificial light, while a prominent cyan glow emanates from various sources, including a cascading light feature on the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

The subject faces the camera directly, with their upper body and head clearly visible, while their hands rest on the desk near the bottom edge of the frame. To the left in the middle ground, a small potted plant sits on a shelf, and to the right, a stack of books is partially visible. The background consists of a plain white wall with a framed landscape painting positioned in the top right corner. The camera is set at eye level with the subject, and there is no noticeable movement or change in shot size throughout the video.",
