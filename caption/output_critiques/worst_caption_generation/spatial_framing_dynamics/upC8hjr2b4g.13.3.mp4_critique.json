    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot captured from a level angle. In the foreground on the left, the lower legs and feet of a standing figure occupy the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground to the right, the dangling lower legs and feet of a second figure are positioned slightly higher and behind the first figure. The scene remains static throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This level-angle shot captures the lower bodies of two figures. On the left, a person stands on the floor, wearing blue trousers and grey, round-toed shoes with thick white soles. A long, white garment hangs down, obscuring the person's torso. To the right and slightly behind, another person's legs dangle in the air, as if they are sitting on a high surface. This second figure is rendered in a distinct low-poly, geometric style, wearing white trousers and matching white, angular shoes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting with a greenish tint, the scene is captured from a level angle, focusing on a smooth, light-colored floor. On the left, a person wearing blue trousers and grey shoes with white soles stands on the floor, partially obscured by a long white robe that sways slightly. To the right, another person's legs, clad in white trousers and stylized, geometric white shoes, dangle in the air next to the wooden leg of a stool. An overlay of white text \"[2]\" is visible in the lower left corner of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
