    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot presents a pixel-art farm scene from a static, high-angle, top-down perspective. Initially, a character is positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, just below a wooden farmhouse. The character moves slightly down and left, briefly standing directly on top of a small tree sapling in the center of the frame. They then walk to the right, stopping beside a tilled plot of land located in the middle ground, to the right of the farmhouse. The character proceeds to use a hoe on the ground to the right of this plot, extending the tilled area. The scene is populated with trees, rocks, and grass in the foreground, middle ground, and background, with another building visible in the top-left background. A user interface with a clock and currency is fixed in the top-right corner, and a toolbar is at the bottom of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel-art scene of a farm, a character with light skin, gray hair, wearing a red shirt and blue pants, stands near a small, green-leafed tree sapling. The character then moves to an untilled area and uses a hoe, causing small brown pixelated clods of earth to appear as he turns the soil. The scene also features a wooden farmhouse with a red roof and a small plot of land with green sprouts.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view presents a pixel-art farm scene, showing mostly the tops of objects with limited sides. The outdoor setting is a mix of green grass and sandy soil, scattered with pine trees, deciduous trees, rocks, and logs. A small wooden farmhouse with a red roof and a smoking chimney initially appears in the upper-center-right of the frame and later shifts to the top. Another wooden building, initially visible in the upper left, eventually moves out of view as the camera moves. Wooden fences are situated in the top left around the property and along some areas in the right side of the frame. Near the house is a rectangular plot of tilled soil with small green sprouts arranged in a grid. A character in a red shirt with gray hair is present on the farm. Overlays are visible on the screen: a heads-up display in the top right corner shows the date, time in the morning, a sun icon for weather, and currency, with an exclamation mark below the currency. A toolbar at the bottom-center displays various tool icons. In the bottom left, temporary small boxes show collected items such as \"Fiber.\" In the bottom right, there is a narrow bar with an \"E\" on top.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "This medium shot displays a pixel-art city street from a side-scrolling perspective. At the start, two characters stand together near the bottom right of the frame, in front of a large brick building with a blue awning. One character moves left across the sidewalk, passing a parked bicycle in the middle ground, while the other remains stationary. The moving character stops at a streetlamp positioned at the center of the frame, then turns to face the camera. Several cars are visible in the background, driving from left to right. A digital map interface is fixed in the bottom left corner, and a health bar appears at the top center. The camera remains at the same height as the characters throughout, with no significant changes in shot size or framing.",
