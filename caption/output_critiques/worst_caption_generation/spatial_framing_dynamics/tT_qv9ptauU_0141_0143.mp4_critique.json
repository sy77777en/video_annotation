    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot where two men are positioned in the background on the left side of the frame. In the foreground, the back of a woman holding a guitar occupies the right side of the frame, but she is out of focus. The focus then shifts from the background to the foreground, transitioning the shot into a medium close-up of the woman. She is now in focus, occupying the center-right of the frame in the foreground, while the two men in the background-left become blurred. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout this transition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a focus on two men in the middle ground of a dimly lit, wood-paneled room. The man on the left, with short dark hair and a beard, wears a light-colored jacket over dark pants and holds a cup. He stands facing an older man with long, unkempt grayish-white hair, a full beard, and a heavy, dark coat with a thick fur collar, who is pouring tea from a blue teapot into the cup. The focus then shifts to the foreground, bringing into view a light-skinned woman with long, wavy blonde hair. She is wearing a dark coat with a thick collar and holds a light-brown acoustic guitar, looking slightly upwards and to her left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at night inside a dimly lit, rustic wooden cabin with dark log walls and plank floors. Through a window in the background, a dark blue, snowy exterior is visible. The interior is furnished with shelves holding numerous bottles and jars, and snowshoes hang on the wall. A small amount of snow is along the edge of the wall in the background. In the foreground, a person with long blonde hair, wearing a dark coat, holds a guitar. A white, circular icon containing an abstract shape resembling a bird is present as an overlay in the upper right corner of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",

To his left, a large potted plant is visible in the foreground, occupying the bottom left corner. In the background, a window spans the entire right side of the frame, letting in daylight. The camera is slightly above the man’s eye level, looking down at him. As the scene progresses, the camera slowly pans right, bringing the window into the center of the frame and shifting the man and plant toward the left edge. The shot size remains consistent throughout, and no other subjects enter or exit the frame.",
