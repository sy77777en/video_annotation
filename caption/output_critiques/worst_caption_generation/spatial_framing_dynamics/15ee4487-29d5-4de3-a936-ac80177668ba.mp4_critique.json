    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot from a low-angle, surface-level perspective, showing a person in a wetsuit suspended in the top center of the frame and positioned in the middle ground. The water occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground, while a shoreline is visible in the background on the right. The person then descends vertically toward the center of the frame, and as they enter the water, the camera's viewpoint submerges. The shot transitions to an underwater view where the person, now in the foreground, continues to move downward through the center of the frame, with the water's turbulent surface now positioned at the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In this black-and-white video, a person in a dark, form-fitting, half-body wetsuit is shown jumping barefoot. The person is captured in mid-air, arched forward with their hands near their hips, as they descend feet-first. The perspective then shifts to an underwater view, where the person's entire body, including the arms, is seen entering the water, surrounded by a splash and bubbles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a black-and-white outdoor scene with a grainy texture, a person in a wetsuit is captured mid-air over a body of water. The setting is under a bright, clear sky with a distant, sloping shoreline visible in the background. The perspective, initially at the water's surface, highlights the dynamic ripples before shifting to a partially submerged view that captures the turbulence and bubbles created as the person enters the water from below.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person jumping into the sea. At first, only his lower body is visible at the top of the frame, then his full body comes into view, becoming a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up from a slightly high angle, showing a cyclist wearing a bright jacket positioned in the bottom left of the frame and occupying the foreground. A paved road stretches diagonally from the bottom right to the top left, passing through the middle ground, while a row of parked cars lines the background along the top edge of the frame. The cyclist moves steadily from the bottom left toward the center, and as they approach the middle of the frame, the camera tilts downward to follow their movement. The shot then transitions with a soft dissolve to a wide shot, where the cyclist is now in the background near the top right, and a group of pedestrians appears in the foreground along the bottom edge, walking from left to right. Throughout both segments, the camera remains above the subjects’ height, maintaining a slightly elevated perspective.",
