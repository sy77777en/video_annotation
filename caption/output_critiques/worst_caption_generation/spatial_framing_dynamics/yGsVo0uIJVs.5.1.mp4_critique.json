    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot at the level of the ship's deck, focusing on the port side. Two covered lifeboats are suspended in the middle ground, positioned from the center to the left of the frame, above a weathered deck. The camera then simultaneously pulls back and ascends, transitioning to a high-angle full shot that reveals the entire length of the large, weathered ship. In the final composition, the vessel is oriented diagonally from the bottom left to the top right of the frame, surrounded by dark, foggy water in the background. A tall derrick rises from the ship's center in the middle ground, while a yellow container is visible on an upper deck slightly to the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with an overhead view and transitions to an aerial perspective, showcasing a large, weathered ship in a dark, foggy setting. The vessel features a long, black hull with a white gunwale, both heavily stained with rust, grime, and what appear to be red splatters. A tall, lattice-like derrick rises from the midsection of the ship. On a lower deck, two lifeboats covered with dark tarps are suspended from davits. On an upper deck, a single, bright yellow, open-topped lifeboat or container is visible. The ship is detailed with circular portholes, railings, vents, and external ladders, all contributing to its aged and industrial appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone pulls back and ascends, revealing a large, weathered ship enveloped in thick, gray fog. The vessel is primarily black with a white gunwale, marked with rust, grime, and red stains on its multi-level superstructure. Covered lifeboats are suspended along the side decks, and a tall derrick rises in the midground. The decks are a brownish-gray, and a yellow, capsule-shaped object is visible on an upper level.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot at ground level, centering on a large train engine positioned in the middle of the frame. Three workers in orange uniforms stand in the bottom right of the foreground, while a stack of wooden crates occupies the left side of the middle ground. The camera slowly pans to the left, shifting the train engine toward the right edge of the frame and bringing a tall signal post into view at the top left in the background. As the camera continues to move, the workers walk toward the center, and the crates are gradually obscured by a passing forklift that enters from the bottom left and exits at the bottom right. Throughout the sequence, the camera remains at the same height as the workers, maintaining a consistent eye-level perspective.",
