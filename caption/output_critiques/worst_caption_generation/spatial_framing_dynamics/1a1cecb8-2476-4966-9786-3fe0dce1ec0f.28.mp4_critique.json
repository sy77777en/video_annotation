    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of a street intersection. Initially, a white-painted crosswalk is in the foreground, spanning the bottom of the frame, with the asphalt road extending into the middle ground. A large, motion-blurred tree is in the center middle ground, with another tree and a streetlight positioned in the upper left. In the background on the right, a building and a distant car are visible. The camera then executes a quick pan to the left, causing the elements on the right to exit the frame. This motion shifts the central tree to the right side of the frame and reveals more of the intersection on the left, including parked cars in the middle ground. The camera maintains a low, level-angle perspective throughout the movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video reveals a dynamic cityscape scenery from a street-level perspective, focusing on an urban intersection. The scene is characterized by the bold white stripes of a crosswalk on the dark asphalt, with blurred forms of trees and buildings silhouetted against a bright, overcast sky. A person with pink hair enters from the left, adding a human element to the scene. Towards the end, their upper body is visible from the shoulder up in the bottom foreground. The sweeping camera movement and resulting motion blur emphasize the overall atmosphere and environment of the city street, capturing the experience of being in the space itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene captures a street intersection at dusk or on a heavily overcast day. The camera performs a brief and somewhat unsteady pan to the left, revealing a paved asphalt road marked with white crosswalks. The sky is bright and uniformly white with a gradient of light blue, and streetlights are on, casting a glow. On the periphery, large trees show significant motion blur, and buildings in the background are visible. A single car can be seen in the distance on the right side of the road, and additional cars become visible on the left side after the camera pans.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a medium shot of a small outdoor café patio. At the start, two round tables with red umbrellas are positioned in the center and right middle ground, with three empty chairs arranged around each table. A bicycle is parked upright at the bottom left foreground, partially cropped by the frame. In the background, a low brick wall runs horizontally across the top of the frame, with potted plants placed evenly along its length. The camera is angled slightly downward from above the tables, providing a clear view of the tabletops and chairs. As the camera slowly tilts upward, the tops of the umbrellas move out of the frame, revealing a row of hanging string lights stretching across the upper background. No people are present until the final moments, when a waiter’s hand briefly enters from the right edge, placing a menu on the nearest table. The camera maintains a slightly elevated height relative to the tables throughout the video.",
