    "pre_caption": "In this third-person perspective video, the camera maintains a medium shot on a man, positioning him in the lower-left of the frame as he moves forward. The scene begins with the man in the foreground, standing before a set of train tracks that recede from the bottom of the frame into the center background, creating a sense of depth. A graffiti-covered structure and a wooden barricade occupy the center-right middle ground, with red lights positioned on the left. As the character walks forward along the tracks, the camera, positioned at his level, follows smoothly. This movement causes the middle-ground structures to shift toward the edges of the frame and eventually off-screen as he passes them. The character's flashlight beam moves dynamically, illuminating different sections of the rocky tunnel walls in the middle ground and background. Throughout the sequence, HUD elements are fixed in the bottom-right and bottom-left corners, while subtitles appear in the bottom center, all overlaid in the extreme foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video follows a man with dark, shoulder-length hair from a third-person perspective. He is wearing a dark coat and has a dark-colored satchel slung over his shoulder. As he walks along a set of train tracks in a dimly lit tunnel, he holds a flashlight that illuminates the path ahead. He also carries a black pistol in his right hand. The man is consistently viewed from behind, positioned slightly to the left of the center in the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot frames a character walking through a dark, underground subway tunnel. The environment is dimly lit by ambient red lights, a blue light emanating from the light source, and the character's moving flashlight, which illuminates the rough, rocky walls and a single set of train tracks. The tunnel is cluttered with debris, including large white bags of rubble, a blue barrel, and a wooden barricade covered in colorful graffiti. On a concrete structure, the word \"INITIATION\" is spray-painted in white. As the character proceeds along the tracks into a narrower section of the tunnel, several overlays appear. In the bottom right corner, a heads-up display shows a gun icon with an ammo count of \"6/25\" and another icon with the number \"2,\" which is visible from the beginning and briefly disappears midway through the video. White subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, reading, \"Another place to use in the story,\" and \"I needed to search the tunnels for further visions.\" In the bottom left, the text \"COLLAPSED TUNNEL\" and white text reading \"PLOT BOARD\" with a small square icon are visible.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a third-person perspective game video. The camera follows the character from behind, showing him in a medium shot while leaving more space for a wide shot of the scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

To her left in the foreground, a large potted plant occupies the bottom left corner, while a tall bookshelf filled with books and vases stands in the background along the right edge. The camera is set slightly above the woman’s eye level, looking down at her and the table. As the scene progresses, the woman stands and moves toward the right side of the frame, passing in front of the bookshelf, while the camera slowly pans right to follow her movement. The potted plant remains stationary in the foreground, and the table shifts out of view to the left. A window with closed curtains is visible in the upper center background throughout the shot. Overlaid on the screen, a digital clock appears in the top right corner, and a notepad icon is intermittently visible in the bottom left.",
