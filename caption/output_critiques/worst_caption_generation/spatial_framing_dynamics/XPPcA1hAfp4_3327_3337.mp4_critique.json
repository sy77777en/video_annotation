    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a top-down perspective, a pixelated character is positioned in the center-left of the frame, occupying the middle ground on a patch of land. To the right, a large wooden platform extends from the right edge towards the center, also in the middle ground, separated from the land by a body of water. The left side of the frame is composed of a dark cave. In the foreground, a user interface includes health bars in the top-left, a mini-map in the top-right, and an inventory hotbar across the bottom. The character initially stands near a small bridge, and a translucent blue square briefly appears on the ground in front of it. The character then moves slightly up and to the left before returning to its starting area, remaining in the center-left portion of the static frame throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pixelated character, viewed from a top-down perspective, has black hair and wears a brown hood, a red tunic, and blue pants. The character's appearance changes as it equips different tools. At various points, it is seen holding a brown and yellow pickaxe, a brown sword, a brown fishing rod, and some other small, hard-to-recognize items. At another moment, it is holding a piece of fence. A translucent blue square periodically appears on the ground near the character. A user interface hotbar at the bottom of the screen displays icons for these tools, with the currently selected item highlighted by a white border.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows a pixel-art scene in a dark, underground cavern. The area is split between a natural cave in the center and left, and a large, square wooden platform on the right, built over dark water and connected by a small wooden bridge. The cave floor consists of brown dirt with green patches, bordered by rough stone walls and a patch of red marking on the ground in the upper-left corner. The entire scene is illuminated by numerous flickering torches. The wooden platform, made of patterned tiles, is furnished with a row of green chests, grey crafting stations, one blue bed, wooden tables, and a single silver chest. A small character moves within the cave area near the bridge to the platform. Overlays are visible on the screen: health and status bars are in the top-left, a mini-map is in the top-right, an inventory hotbar is at the bottom, and controller button prompts are in the bottom-right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "In a medium close-up shot from a low angle, a group of three pixelated animals is arranged along the bottom right of the frame, standing on a sandy beach. A tall stone tower rises in the background, occupying the top left and extending into the middle ground. The shoreline curves from the bottom left to the center, with small boats floating in the foreground near the left edge. The camera is positioned below the animals’ eye level, looking slightly upward. Throughout the video, the animals remain stationary while a large red flag on the tower waves back and forth. The user interface displays a compass at the bottom center, a weather indicator in the top left, and a crafting menu along the right edge. No significant changes in shot size or subject position occur during the scene.",
