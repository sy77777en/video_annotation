    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man is positioned on the right side of the frame in the middle ground. In the foreground on the left, a tall, out-of-focus glass is held by blurred fingers visible at the bottom left. The scene is set against a solid black background, and the camera is positioned at the subject's level. The framing remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with reflective, silver-colored skin is depicted in a close-up view. He has a matching silver mustache and goatee, and his expression is stern as he looks slightly to his left. He is dressed in a dark, pinstriped suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a dark tie with red diagonal stripes. On his head, he wears a black fedora with a brown band. In the foreground, the man is holding a tall, transparent glass, and at the bottom left, the blurred tips of three silver fingers can be seen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a scene set against a solid black background, a figure with metallic, silver-toned skin is depicted. The figure is dressed in a dark pinstripe suit, a white collared shirt, a patterned tie, and a black fedora with a brown band. Positioned in the foreground and out of focus is a tall, transparent glass object. The lighting accentuates the reflective quality of the figure's skin and the glass. A small overlay of white text subtitles is present in the lower-left corner of the video displaying: \"[32]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

On the right side in the background, a small potted plant sits on a low table, partially obscured by her shoulder. The left side of the frame shows a window with daylight streaming in, occupying the middle ground. The camera is positioned slightly above the woman's eye level, looking down at her. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly pans from left to right, keeping the woman in the center while the background elements shift accordingly.",
