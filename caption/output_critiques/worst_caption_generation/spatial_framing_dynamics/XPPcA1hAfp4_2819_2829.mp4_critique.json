    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot is captured from a high-angle, top-down perspective. Initially, a pixelated character is positioned in the center-left of the frame, standing within a rectangular garden plot located in the middle ground at the screen's center. To the top-left, a wooden platform extends over a body of water, while another body of water is visible on the right. In the bottom-left foreground, several cross-shaped wooden structures are present. An orange, circular creature is situated to the right of the garden in the middle ground. The character moves around the garden plot before walking towards the bottom-left of the scene. As they move, the camera tracks them, causing the garden to shift to the top-right of the frame and the cross-shaped structures to move closer to the center. The character then walks back towards the garden, with the camera following to return the scene to its original framing. UI elements, including status bars, a mini-map, an inventory hotbar, and button prompts, remain fixed in the top-left, top-right, bottom-center, and bottom-right corners of the screen, respectively.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, pixelated character with black hair, fair skin, and a red shirt is positioned within a tilled garden plot. The garden contains three distinct types of plants arranged in columns: one variety has green leaves and small red flowers, another features large, glowing, multifaceted blue gems, and the third has green leaves with orange flowers, along with some sprouts. To the right of the garden, a large, orange, circular, bubble-like creature is visible. In the lower-left area, which occasionally shifts to the upper-left as the camera tracks the character, there are several wooden, cross-shaped structures with green vines growing on them, and several red-capped mushrooms sit on the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, showing mostly the tops of objects with limited sides, depicts a pixel-art scene set at night or underground. The area is illuminated by numerous torches placed on the brown, earthy ground. In the center, a character tends to a rectangular garden plot filled with red-flowered plants, orange-flowered plants, and others bearing glowing blue, gem-like fruits. Two unconnected dark bodies of water are distributed at the top and right of the scene. Mostly to the top-left, a wooden platform with a tiled floor extends over the water. Several gnarled, tree-like formations are in the lower-left corner and sometimes appear toward the upper left as the camera moves to track the character. Overlays are present on the screen: in the top-left corner are status bars and icons; a mini-map is in the top-right; in the bottom center is an inventory hotbar displaying tools like a pickaxe, shovel, and watering can; and in the bottom-right are controller button prompts.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "This medium shot is presented from a low-angle, slightly tilted perspective. A pixelated dog is initially visible in the bottom-right corner of the frame, sitting on a circular stone platform located in the foreground. To the top-center, a tall metal tower rises into the background, with a red flag waving at its peak. On the left side of the frame, a row of blue vending machines lines the middle ground, stretching from the bottom-left to the center-left. A green, rectangular robot is first seen near the vending machines but soon moves toward the stone platform. The dog remains mostly stationary while the robot circles around the platform in a clockwise direction. As the robot moves, the camera pans upward and slightly to the right, causing the stone platform to shift toward the center and the metal tower to move closer to the top-right of the frame. The vending machines become partially obscured as the camera continues to follow the robot’s movement. UI elements, such as a digital clock, a weather icon, a chat window, and a score counter, are fixed in the top-right, top-left, bottom-left, and bottom-center corners of the screen, respectively.",
