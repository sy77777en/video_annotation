    "pre_caption": "This is a point-of-view shot from inside a moving car, framed as a close-up on the interior and a wide shot of the scenery. In the foreground, the dark silhouette of the dashboard occupies the bottom of the frame, with a small illuminated screen at the bottom left and an out-of-focus rearview mirror at the top center. Through the windshield, a road extends from the bottom center into the background, flanked on the left and right by trees in the middle ground. In the background, a cloud of smoke is centered over the road, with small reflective signs positioned along the roadside in the middle ground. The camera is fixed at an eye-level height from a driver's perspective. As the car moves forward, the road and trees appear to flow from the background toward the foreground, and the smoke in the distance gradually becomes larger in the center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a fixed point-of-view shot from inside a car driving at night. The car's interior is seen as a dark, out-of-focus silhouette, showing the top of the dashboard, a rearview mirror reflecting a bright, circular light, and a small illuminated screen. Through the windshield, a dark, paved road is visible, flanked by trees and illuminated by the car's headlights. In the distance, a patch of blue-white smoke or fog hangs over the road, and small, reflective road signs are visible along the roadside.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A fixed point-of-view shot captures a scene at night on a two-lane asphalt road winding through a dark forest. The road, marked with a white center line, curves uphill into the distance where a thick cloud of blue-tinged smoke or fog is illuminated by the vehicle's headlights. On the left side of the road, a streetlamp casts a yellow glow on the trees, and white reflective posts are visible. The dark, out-of-focus silhouette of the car's dashboard, a rearview mirror, and a small illuminated screen on the left frame the view.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is positioned inside a car, capturing a close-up of the interior and a wide shot of the scenery outside.",

  "bad_caption": "This is a medium shot taken from the back seat of a stationary bus, focusing on two passengers seated in the middle ground at the center and right of the frame. The left side of the frame shows a large open window, revealing a city skyline in the background with several tall buildings and a bridge stretching across the top left. In the foreground, a backpack rests on the aisle floor at the bottom center. The camera is positioned slightly above the passengers’ heads, angled downward. Throughout the video, the passengers remain still while a cyclist passes by outside the window from left to right, briefly appearing in the middle ground before exiting the frame. No significant changes in shot size or camera position occur during the scene.",
