    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot, the wreckage of a submarine is positioned in the center of the frame and occupies the middle ground. It is suspended from a large gantry-like structure, with a horizontal walkway spanning the top of the frame and vertical supports in the foreground on the left and in the middle ground on the right. Beams of light descend from the top of the frame, cutting through the dark water and illuminating the central wreckage. In the background on the right, faint, out-of-focus lights are visible in the distance. The camera is positioned at the level of the submarine.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark, heavily damaged submarine is suspended in deep blue water, held in place by a stable underwater structure. Two vertical columnar metal structures on the left support a long, narrow metal frame above, from which the submarine wreckage hangs. The submarine is broken and mangled, with large sections of its metallic hull missing, exposing its inner framework. A tail fin is visible on its left side. Beams of light shine down from above, piercing the dark water and illuminating the wreckage.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, deep blue underwater environment, a large, metallic gantry-like structure with a walkway on top is suspended in the water. Hanging from this structure is the mangled wreckage of a dark, metallic submersible, its hull appearing torn and fragmented. Beams of light penetrate the water from above, illuminating the wreck and the surrounding structure, while faint, out-of-focus lights are visible in the distant, dark water. A small overlay in the lower left corner displays the white text \"[2]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

A school of brightly colored fish swims across the middle ground from right to left, partially obscuring the divers. In the background, a sunken treasure chest is visible near the top right, surrounded by scattered gold coins. The camera is positioned above the divers, looking down at an angle as they move slowly around the coral, with the fish creating shifting patterns of movement across the scene.",
