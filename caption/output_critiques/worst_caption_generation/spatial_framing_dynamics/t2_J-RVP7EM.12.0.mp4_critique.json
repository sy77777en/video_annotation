    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of two glowing, sketch-like figures in a dark, cavernous setting. The primary subject, a man submerged in water, is positioned in the center of the frame and occupies the middle ground. Behind him, also in the center and middle ground, a second figure on the shore embraces him. The dark liquid they are in fills the foreground and middle ground, while the shadowy background suggests the walls of a cave. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark, murky body of water, a muscular, bearded man is depicted in a sketchy, glowing white illustrative style. He is submerged up to his chest, with his left hand tightly covering his bowed head, while his right arm is extended and held above the water. On the shore behind him, another similarly rendered white figure wraps their right arm around the submerged person's arm, gently resting their head on top of his.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, cavernous setting, a pool of dark liquid fills the scene, with bright reflections visible on its surface. Partially submerged in the center is a glowing, white, sketch-like figure of a person cradling another. The background is obscured by deep shadows, hinting at the walls of a cave. The entire scene is monochromatic.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "bad_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a single glowing animal, resembling a fox, positioned slightly to the left of center in the foreground. To the right in the background, a large tree trunk extends vertically, partially out of frame. The ground beneath the animal is covered in bright grass, filling the lower portion of the frame, while the upper background shows a clear sky. The camera is angled slightly above the animal, looking down at it. No significant movement or changes in shot size occur throughout the scene.",
