    "pre_caption": "The video opens with the camera positioned at the water's surface, capturing the sun and a building in the top left background. The camera then moves downward, submerging to reveal a medium shot of a person's upper body swimming in the center foreground. From this underwater perspective, which is level with the swimmer, the person moves toward and past the camera. Subsequently, the camera rises back above the surface, returning to a position above the swimmer. In this final view, the back of the swimmer's head occupies the bottom center foreground, moving away into the middle ground. The background elements, including the building and a metal structure on the left and the ocean horizon on the right, remain consistently framed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with the camera at water level, quickly transitioning to an underwater perspective. It captures a person, who appears to be a woman, swimming in a white camisole. Initially seen as a dark silhouette against the blue water, her head with dark hair is visible along with her arms as she moves, surrounded by air bubbles. The viewpoint then rises above the surface, showing the back of her head and back as she swims away amidst splashing water. Due to the underwater distortion and brief surface view, further details of her appearance are not discernible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is captured from a perspective at the surface of a body of water, alternating between underwater and above-water views. During the submerged moments, the view is a murky blue filled with bubbles and the dark silhouette of a person swimming. When the camera breaks the surface, the bright sun is visible in a clear blue sky, creating a strong glare on the water. The water splashes and churns around the camera. In the background, the dark silhouette of a building and a metal framework stand on the edge of the pool, with the ocean visible on the horizon.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera first moves downward from the water’s surface into the underwater scene, capturing a person swimming below, with her upper body visible. It then moves upward again, causing the swimmer to disappear from the frame, and the video ends.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera starts above the person in the water, at the surface. It then moves downward until it is level with the swimmer, before rising again to return to a position above them.\n",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot showing a cyclist riding along a paved path, positioned in the lower center of the frame and occupying the foreground. The camera is set at the cyclist’s eye level, capturing the handlebars and front wheel as they move steadily forward. To the left in the middle ground, a row of tall trees lines the path, while a park bench is visible in the background on the right side. As the cyclist continues, the camera pans slightly to the right, keeping the cyclist centered while the trees and bench shift toward the left edge of the frame. The camera remains at a consistent height throughout, parallel to the cyclist’s position. No other people or vehicles enter the frame, and the spatial arrangement of the path, trees, and bench remains constant as the cyclist moves forward.",
