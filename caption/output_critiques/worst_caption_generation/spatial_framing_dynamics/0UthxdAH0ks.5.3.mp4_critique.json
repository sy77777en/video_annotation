    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a group of shirtless men is arranged in a tight circle in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The scene starts in near darkness, with a flickering red overhead light briefly illuminating the men before stabilizing to reveal the group more clearly. The men, who face inwards, occupy the central area of the frame against a completely dark background. The camera remains static at the subjects' level, positioned as if looking into the circle from just outside of it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of approximately ten young, shirtless Asian men with muscular builds are gathered in a tight circle, facing inwards. The room is mainly lit with a yellow light that accentuates the contours of their backs and shoulders, although a red light is also present. Most of the men have short, dark hair, but one man standing near the center of the circle has short, dyed red hair. Their faces are partially visible, showing serious or neutral expressions as they look towards the center of their huddle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, undefined indoor space, a group of shirtless men are gathered in a circle. The overhead lights flicker on and off slowly, causing the figures to intermittently appear and disappear. One individual in the circle has reddish-colored hair.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The room is brightly lit with natural daylight streaming in from the window, casting clear shadows on the floor. Several potted plants are arranged along the bottom left and center of the frame in the middle ground. The camera remains stationary at eye level with the woman throughout the scene, with no noticeable movement or change in shot size.",
