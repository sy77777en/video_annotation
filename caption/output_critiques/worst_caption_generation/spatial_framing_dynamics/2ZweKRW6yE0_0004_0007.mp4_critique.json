    "pre_caption": "This static, out-of-focus shot is framed as a close-up. A dark, vertical element occupies the left foreground of the frame. To its right, a light gray panel fills the center and right portions of the middle ground. This panel features multiple rows of blurry, circular white shapes. A small, green light is positioned in the upper left area of the panel, with a faint blue light visible directly above it at the top of the frame. The camera remains stationary at a height level with the subject throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a heavily out-of-focus, close-up shot of an electronic device, likely a piece of audio equipment. The device features a light gray or silver-colored front panel populated with multiple rows of indistinct, circular white or silver shapes, which appear to be knobs or dials. On the upper left side of the panel, a small, bright green indicator light is illuminated. Above this, a faint blue light is also visible. A dark, black vertical surface occupies the left portion of the view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An out-of-focus, close-up view captures a piece of electronic equipment in an indoor setting. The device features a light-colored faceplate with multiple rows of round, reflective knobs, which appear as soft, circular bokeh highlights. Near the top, a small, round, green indicator light remains steadily illuminated, and a blue light is also visible. The equipment is positioned against a blurred, yet not dark, background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
