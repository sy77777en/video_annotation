    "pre_caption": "This static wide shot of a forest is captured from a low-angle, worm's-eye perspective, looking directly up at the canopy. Tall, dark tree trunks are positioned in the foreground and middle ground, rising from the bottom, left, and right edges of the frame and extending inward toward the top center. Their silhouetted branches and leaves spread across the middle ground, creating a dense frame around a central opening. In the background, a bright area of sky is visible in the center of the composition, with beams of light radiating outward through the misty atmosphere in the middle ground. The framing and all elements within the scene remain completely stationary.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a worm's-eye view, monochrome shot of a forest canopy, with tall trees as the central subjects. These trees feature dark, elongated trunks that ascend from the outer edges and converge inward, emphasizing their height and verticality. The branches are covered in dark, silhouetted foliage that spreads across the frame, contrasting sharply with the bright, diffuse light of the sky above. The arrangement of the trees creates a tunnel-like effect, drawing the eye toward the central point of convergence amidst the dense natural growth. Later in the video, a silhouette of a person riding a bicycle enters the frame from the upper left corner, leaps through the air, and exits from the lower right corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A worm's-eye, black and white view from the forest floor looks straight up at the sky. Tall, dark tree trunks rise and converge, their silhouetted branches and leaves forming a dense canopy. A bright, white patch of sky is visible through a circular opening in the center. Beams of light pierce through the misty atmosphere between the trees, creating a high-contrast, radial pattern.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video initially shows a wide shot of the scenery. Then, a person riding a bicycle enters the frame, shown in a wide shot. As the person leaves, the shot returns to the wide shot of the scenery.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is below the subject, and the camera height remains unchanged.",

  "bad_caption": "This medium shot shows a group of people seated around a circular table in an open field, viewed from a slightly elevated camera angle. The table is positioned in the center of the frame and occupies the foreground, while the participants are evenly spaced around it, facing inward. In the middle ground, several large sunflowers are visible on the left and right sides of the frame, rising above the seated figures. The background features a distant mountain range stretching across the top of the frame. During the video, the camera slowly pans from left to right, causing the table and people to shift from the center toward the right side of the frame, while the sunflowers and mountains remain stationary in their respective positions. The camera maintains a height above the subjects’ heads throughout the movement.",
