    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot from a high-angle, top-down perspective, capturing a static scene. A large, cross-shaped wooden platform is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground over a body of dark water. On the left side of the platform's central area, a character stands still. Various objects are arranged on the platform in the middle ground: a row of green chests is at the top, a bed is in the center, crafting stations and tables are to the left and right of the center, and a single chest is on the bottom-left extension. The platform is surrounded by reddish-brown cavern terrain. In the foreground, user interface elements are overlaid on the scene, with a health bar in the top-left, a mini-map in the top-right, an item hotbar across the bottom, and controller prompts in the bottom-right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel-art scene, a character with short brown hair, a red shirt, and blue pants stands on a large wooden platform. The character is positioned on the left side of the platform's center, facing upward. The platform is organized as a storage area, featuring a row of eight identical green chests at the top. In the left-middle section of the platform, there is a silver-colored, machine-like object and several wooden tables. The blue bed is positioned in the exact center of the platform. To the right of these items are tables: three wooden tables, one brown table, and one patterned table, alongside a small, round, grey stone object. A single blue and silver chest is located in the lower left part of the platform, which is illuminated by numerous lit torches on posts.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view displays a pixel art scene within a dimly lit cavern. A large, cross-shaped wooden platform is constructed over a body of dark, still water, with the surrounding area consisting of reddish-brown earth and patches of green grass. The scene is illuminated by numerous torches placed on posts around the platform and on the adjacent land. On the platform, there is an organized collection of items, including a row of green chests along the top edge, several tables of various colors and designs, a bed, crafting stations, and a metallic machine. A single character with brown hair is present on the platform. The scene features several overlay elements: a health bar in the top-left corner, a mini-map in the top-right, a hotbar with tools and item counts at the bottom, and controller button prompts in the bottom-right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",

To the right of the car, a tall traffic light stands at the center, while a row of blue cones lines the top edge of the road in the background. A small dog sits on the hood of the car, facing right. The road is bordered by grassy terrain on both sides.
