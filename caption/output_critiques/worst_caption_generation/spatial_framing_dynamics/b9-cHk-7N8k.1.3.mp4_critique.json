In the middle ground, a woman stands to the right of center inside a boat, while another woman is seated further back in the top right under a canopy.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features five individuals on a speedboat, either standing or sitting. In the foreground, a tan, sun-kissed man with dark hair, a beard, and a mustache is smiling while holding a camera. He is wearing a black and blue life vest with the word \"HYPERLITE\" on it and a black baseball cap with an orange and white logo, dark text, and a yellow accent. In the mid-ground, a tan woman with long dark hair is standing inside the boat's cabin, initially facing the stern before turning to the right of the frame. She is wearing a light gray bikini top, white bikini bottoms, a dark baseball cap, and sunglasses. At the stern of the boat, outside the canopy, two women are seated. The woman on the left is in a black bikini, relaxed with one hand raised to her head. The woman on the right is also in a dark bikini and is wearing a black and blue life vest, seated at the stern and turning her head to face behind and to her left. Additionally, a shirtless man in blue-gray shorts is seated at the back right of the boat, positioned in the stern area with his head turned to his right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a selfie point of view, a man wearing a black and blue life vest and a black cap is seen on a speedboat. The boat is on a calm, dark blue body of water, surrounded by massive, layered orange and brown rock canyons under a clear, sunny sky. The still water reflects the surrounding landscape. In the middle ground, within the boat, a woman is standing in the middle of the cabin, while two women in swimsuits are seated outside the canopy at the stern, and another man is also seated nearby.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

A bicycle is parked at the bottom right in the middle ground, partially obscured by tall grass. In the background, a row of small houses lines the top of the frame, stretching from the center to the right. A narrow dirt path runs diagonally from the bottom left corner to the center, passing behind the tree and leading toward the houses. The camera is positioned slightly above the tree, looking down at an angle. No significant movement occurs within the scene.",
