    "pre_caption": "In this wide shot, a trolley occupies the left side of the frame in the middle ground, moving horizontally toward the right. A man, positioned in the center of the frame and also in the middle ground, runs alongside the trolley. As both subjects travel across the scene, the man leaps into a horizontal position, suspended in mid-air in the center of the frame while holding onto the trolley. Buildings are visible in the background, spanning the top and right portions of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level and pans to track their rightward movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black-and-white video, a man with dark hair, wearing a dark suit jacket and trousers, is seen running alongside an old-fashioned trolley. He grips the back of the trolley with his right hand while holding a bag in his left hand. As he runs, his body becomes suspended horizontally in mid-air, parallel to the ground, with his legs bent at the knees and kicked up behind him. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This black and white video is set outdoors on a paved street during the daytime. A dark-colored trolley with visible steps and windows moves along the street, creating motion blur in the background, which consists of simple, light-colored industrial or residential buildings. Initially, a man wearing a dark suit is seen running alongside the trolley, gripping it with one hand. He then becomes horizontally suspended in the air as he holds onto the side of the moving vehicle. The entire scene is framed by black bars on the left and right sides.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

She holds a large umbrella above her head, which extends into the top center of the frame. A small dog sits at her feet in the bottom right foreground, looking up at her. Behind them, a row of bicycles is lined up along the left edge of the frame in the background, stretching from the bottom left to the top left. The camera is positioned slightly above the woman’s eye level, angled downward. Throughout the shot, the woman remains stationary while the dog briefly shifts its position closer to the center. No significant changes in shot size or camera movement occur.",
