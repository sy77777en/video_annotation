    "pre_caption": "This scenery video starts as a medium-long shot, focusing on the upper portion of a two-story brick house, which is centered in the middle ground. In the foreground, a tall yucca tree stands in the center-right, with another plant in the bottom-left, both partially obscuring the building. The tops of palm trees are visible in the top-left background. The camera then zooms out to a wide shot, revealing the entire house, which remains centered in the middle ground. This movement also exposes more of the foreground, including additional greenery and a black railing that appears across the bottom of the frame. The camera maintains a low-angle perspective, looking up at the house throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot capturing the exterior of a two-story, red brick house under a flat, overcast sky. The building displays a dark gabled roof with white trim, and a prominent feature on the second story is a white stucco panel accented with dark timber framing. A tall, multi-trunked yucca tree with spiky green leaves is part of the scene, its branches partially obscuring the brick facade. As the camera zooms out, more of the garden greenery and a black railing at the base become visible. The shot lacks a main subject, as its purpose is to establish a sense of place and capture the specific architectural style and atmosphere of the location. The composition emphasizes the interplay between the man-made structure and the surrounding vegetation rather than singling out a particular person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor view on an overcast day initially focuses on the upper portion of a two-story house with a red brick facade and a dark, pitched roof. A prominent feature on the second story is a large, white stucco panel with dark blue timber framing arranged in an abstract pattern. As the camera zooms out, it reveals more of the courtyard's lush greenery and a black railing at the bottom, providing a full view of the two-story building. Consequently, the tall, spiky-leafed plants, including multi-trunked yucca or dragon trees, transition to the mid-ground, enhancing the overall composition. The tops of palm trees are visible in the background against the uniformly white sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

A large stone fountain occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground, while a small bicycle is visible in the bottom-right foreground. In the background, a row of tall pine trees lines the top edge of the frame, stretching from left to right. The camera slowly pans upward, shifting the focus to the treetops, which now dominate the upper half of the frame, while the cabin and fountain move toward the bottom edge and become partially obscured. Throughout the video, the camera remains at eye level with the fountain, maintaining a straight-on perspective relative to the main elements.",
