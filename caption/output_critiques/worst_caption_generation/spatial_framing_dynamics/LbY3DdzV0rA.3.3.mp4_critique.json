    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a desert landscape, focusing on the scenery rather than a specific subject. The sandy terrain, populated with low-lying shrubs and cacti, occupies the bottom third of the frame, extending from the immediate foreground into the middle ground. In the background, a dark, concentrated column of rain descends from the center of the sky toward the horizon line. The upper two-thirds of the frame are dominated by massive, dark storm clouds that swirl and converge toward the center in a time-lapse sequence. The camera maintains a static, low-angle position, emphasizing the vast scale of the sky and the storm system above the flat desert floor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dramatic desert landscape scenery shot, showcasing a powerful storm system in a time-lapse sequence. The sky is dominated by immense, turbulent clouds in shades of deep grey and purple, which swirl and evolve rapidly. A concentrated downpour, resembling a microburst, descends from the center of the cloud formation, creating a dark curtain of rain against the horizon. The sandy terrain extends from the foreground to the background, dotted with sparse, low-lying green and yellow vegetation, while the silhouettes of several tall saguaro cacti stand against the storm. There is no single main subject, as the focus is placed on the overwhelming scale and atmospheric power of the weather event in relation to the vast, open desert environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a desert landscape under a turbulent sky, massive, dark gray and purplish storm clouds swirl and converge, with a dense column of rain descending from their center in the background. The sandy, reddish-brown earth extends continuously from the foreground to the background, sparsely populated with low-lying green and yellow shrubs, prickly pear cacti, and the silhouettes of tall saguaro cacti.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

The tree’s branches extend upward and outward, reaching toward the top edge of the frame, while its trunk is positioned slightly to the right of center. In the middle ground, a small pond is visible on the left side, reflecting the tree’s lower branches. The background shows a row of distant mountains stretching across the top left and top center of the frame. The camera is positioned at eye level with the tree’s lower branches and remains static throughout the shot, with no visible movement or transitions.",
