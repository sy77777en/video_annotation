    "pre_caption": "A blue pencil sketch of an abstract figure is initially positioned in the center of the frame against a white background. The figure animates, transforming and rising into the form of a heavyset man who remains centered. In its final state, the man stands facing forward, holding a wok in his left hand at the bottom of the frame and a spatula in his right hand, which is positioned over the wok. The camera maintains an eye-level perspective on the character throughout the transformation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a blue pencil sketch animation that begins with a character appearing as a crab before transforming into a heavyset man with short dark hair, wearing a short-sleeved shirt. The animation captures him in a dynamic pose, initially raising his right arm and then lowering it, while his left hand consistently holds a wok. In the final pose, he faces forward with a neutral expression, holding the wok in his left hand and stirring its contents with a slotted spatula in his right hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a plain white background, a blue pencil sketch animation unfolds. The sequence begins with a character resembling a crab, which then transforms into a large man who is cooking. In the final pose, it is revealed that he is holding a wok and stirring its contents with a spatula.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "bad_caption": "A medium shot shows a red ink drawing of a geometric bird, initially placed in the upper right corner of the frame on a light gray background. The bird animates by gliding diagonally downward toward the lower left, gradually morphing into a slender tree that becomes positioned in the left middle ground. In the final frame, the tree stands upright with a single branch extending to the right edge of the frame, while a small apple appears at the tip of the branch. The camera remains at the same height as the tree throughout the sequence.",
