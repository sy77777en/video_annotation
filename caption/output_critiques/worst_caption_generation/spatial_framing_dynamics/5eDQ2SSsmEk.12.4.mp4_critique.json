    "pre_caption": "In an extreme close-up shot, the upper portion of a small bottle is positioned in the center-left foreground. In the background, out-of-focus reddish lights are visible, primarily on the right side of the frame. A person's fingers enter the shot from the top right and move toward the center to grip the bottle's stopper, which is also in the foreground. The fingers then twist the stopper while remaining in this central position. The camera is static and positioned at the subject's level throughout the entire sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit setting with dramatic red backlighting, a person's fingers grip and twist the clear, faceted glass stopper of a small, dark glass bottle. The video focuses on the interaction between the hand and the upper portion of the bottle, which is partially visible. Droplets of moisture on the bottle's exterior catch the light, while the background is blurred into soft, reddish bokeh lights.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit setting, a close-up highlights a small, dark bottle filled with a deep-colored liquid. The bottle is sealed with a clear, faceted glass stopper. Dramatic lighting enhances the scene, with a warm red light outlining the bottle and a cool blue light illuminating a hand reaching for the stopper. The background is blurred, featuring soft, reddish-orange bokeh lights. A single drop of the dark liquid is visible on the bottle's neck as the hand interacts with the stopper, emphasizing the presence of the dark liquid inside.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The camera remains slightly above the subjects, looking down at an angle, and there are no significant changes in shot size or camera position throughout the scene.",
