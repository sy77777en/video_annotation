    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured from directly above, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame, lying back on a large, circular gray rug that occupies the central middle ground. Her body is oriented diagonally across the frame, with her arms outstretched. The wooden floor surrounds the rug in the middle ground. A portion of a sofa is visible in the bottom-left of the frame, a dark rectangular shape is in the top-right, and a small, colorful object is located in the bottom-right, near the woman's hand.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a top-down perspective, a woman with dark, curly hair and a light-to-medium skin tone is standing and leaning backward in the center of a large, circular, gray textured rug. She is wearing a long-sleeved, off-white top, dark blue pants, and white socks. Her arms are outstretched to her sides, and her legs are extended, with one leg slightly raised. Her head is tilted back as she looks upward. A notebook with several pens of various colors is placed on a small round table near one of her hands.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye view, the scene is set indoors within a warmly lit room featuring light brown wooden floors. A large, circular, woven gray rug is positioned centrally on the floor. A woman in a white shirt, dark pants, and white socks is standing and leaning backward on the rug with her arms outstretched. Portions of surrounding furniture are visible, including the corner of a light-colored sofa and a dark rectangular shape on the floor. A notebook with several multicolored pens is placed on a small round table near one of her hands.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "In a medium close-up shot taken from a low angle, a man sits cross-legged in the center of a square, patterned blue carpet, facing directly toward the camera. His head and shoulders fill most of the frame, with his hands resting on his knees. The background consists of a white tiled floor and a small potted plant positioned in the top-left corner of the frame, occupying the background. To the right, a stack of books is visible in the middle ground, near the edge of the carpet. As the camera slowly tilts upward, the man’s head moves toward the bottom of the frame, and the potted plant and books shift out of view, leaving only the carpet and floor visible. The camera remains below the subject’s eye level throughout the shot.",
