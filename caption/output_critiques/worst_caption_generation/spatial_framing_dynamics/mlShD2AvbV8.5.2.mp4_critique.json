    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, a large blue mat occupies the bottom left foreground, with a vaulting horse positioned in the left middle ground. A woman in a turquoise top stands stationary in the right foreground, observing the scene. A gymnast in a black leotard begins in the background on the right side of a long runway. She runs forward, moving from the background into the middle ground along the center of the frame. She then vaults over the horse, moving through the air from the center to land on the blue mat in the bottom left foreground. Throughout the action, other gymnasts remain in the background on the right, and several national flags are visible on the left wall in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a young woman with light skin and blonde hair tied back, who is dressed in a black leotard. She is shown running down a long runway and performing a handspring vault over a red and blue vaulting horse, landing on a large blue mat. Standing to the side and observing her is another young woman with long, dark hair and medium-dark complexion, wearing a turquoise long-sleeved top and light gray sweatpants, with her arms crossed. In the far background, a few other young women in leotards are visible, standing in a line.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a long, narrow section of a gymnastics facility, characterized by a mix of white and gray cinder block walls and a green runway floor featuring a long, narrow, light blue mat. In the foreground, a red and blue vaulting horse is positioned next to a large blue landing mat. Along the left wall, several national flags, including those of Croatia, Israel, and Canada, are hung in a row. The ceiling features exposed pipes and fluorescent lighting. On the right, a single closed bay door is visible in the middle ground, while a person in a teal sweatshirt stands in the right foreground, observing the scene. Additional gymnastics equipment extends from the foreground to the background on the right side, where an American flag in the background is also visible. During the scene, a gymnast in a black leotard runs down the green track and performs a flip over the vaulting horse.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

Two men in white shirts are seated on opposite sides of the table, one on the left foreground and the other on the right foreground, both focused on the chess game. A third person in a red jacket stands in the middle ground at the center, watching the match.
