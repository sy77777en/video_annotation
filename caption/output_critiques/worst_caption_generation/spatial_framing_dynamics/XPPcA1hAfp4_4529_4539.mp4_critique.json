    "pre_caption": "In this extreme wide shot, viewed from a high-angle, top-down perspective, a human figure and a creature are positioned in the center of the frame on a railway bridge. This bridge spans horizontally across the middle ground, situated above a dark body of water. A landmass with a tree and containers occupies the top-left, while another landmass is on the top-right. The bottom of the frame is an undefined dark foreground. Throughout the video, the human figure moves from one side of the creature to the other, striking it and pushing it back and forth along the central bridge. The surrounding environment and the UI elements—a health bar in the top-left, a mini-map in the top-right, an item hotbar at the bottom, and action icons in the bottom-right—remain stationary.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pixelated human figure with dark hair, wearing a red shirt and blue shoes, interacts with an atypical four-legged creature on a set of railway tracks. The creature is primarily white with a large purple patch on its back, a purple tail, and a small horn on its head. The human figure is shown striking the creature, causing white numbers to appear above it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides. The scene is set in a dark, outdoor area illuminated by torches, resembling a canyon or gorge rather than a cave. A wooden railway track on a bridge crosses a dark body of water, connecting two sections of yellowish, sandy ground bordered by brown rock cliffs. On the left side, there is a tree with yellow-orange leaves, along with some wooden barrels and a green chest. A small character and a white and purple creature move back and forth across the railway bridge. The scene includes several overlay elements: a health bar in the top left, a mini-map in the top right, an item hotbar with inventory counts at the bottom, and action icons in the bottom right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",

A streetlamp is visible in the top-left, while a bus stop shelter appears in the top-right. The upper portion of the frame shows a clear sky. During the video, one vehicle slowly reverses toward the left edge of the frame, while the other remains stationary. The camera is positioned at street level, matching the height of the vehicles. UI elements include a speedometer in the bottom-left, a fuel gauge in the bottom-right, a GPS map at the top-center, and a clock in the top-left, all remaining fixed throughout the scene.",
