    "pre_caption": "This is a static, extreme wide shot of a city alley, captured from a high-angle, top-down perspective. The scene is a scenery shot with no main subject. In the foreground, the edge of a building's roof occupies the bottom of the frame. The alley floor below extends through the middle ground, where a red car is parked on the right side and scattered boxes are located in the center and toward the left. The scene is flanked by tall buildings on the left and right, with the building across the alley positioned at the top of the frame. The camera remains stationary high above the scene, looking directly down.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a dramatic, bird's-eye view, top-down perspective of a narrow city alleyway at night during a rainstorm. The wet tiled street below reflects the dim, atmospheric glow from streetlights and windows, with warm light illuminating the alleyway between two tall buildings and dark patches on the ground likely due to puddles. A red car is parked on the right side of the alley, while scattered boxes are visible on the ground. There is no main subject; the vertiginous perspective from the rooftop emphasizes the scale of the urban environment and establishes a gritty, noir-like atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a top-down view of a narrow, rain-slicked urban alley at night. The alley is flanked by tall buildings, and the wet tiled pavement below reflects the glow from a few scattered light sources, including a streetlight and illuminated windows. In the foreground, an iron railing extending from the building's window is visible, while across the alley, another building features several small vents or windows. A red car is parked on the right side of the alley, and various pieces of debris, including boxes and a tarp, are scattered on the ground. Rain falls through the air, and a few objects are positioned near the base of the left-hand building.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

The main subjects are positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground, with one person on the left and the other on the right. Behind them, a large window fills the background, showing a garden with several trees and a stone pathway extending from the bottom left to the top right. A potted plant is visible in the bottom right corner of the frame, placed in the middle ground. The camera remains at the same height as the subjects, capturing their upper bodies and the tabletop.
