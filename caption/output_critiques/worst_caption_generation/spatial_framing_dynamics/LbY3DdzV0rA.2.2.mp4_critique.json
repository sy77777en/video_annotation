    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide, static shot of a desert landscape, with the camera positioned at a low angle. The foreground, occupying the bottom of the frame, consists of dry earth, green desert shrubs, and a few saguaro cacti. In the middle ground, a range of rocky mountains extends across the scene. The background is initially divided, with a massive, brownish-orange dust storm on the left and a stormy blue sky with white clouds on the right. The primary dynamic is the dust storm, which advances from the left side of the frame to the right, progressively obscuring the mountains in the middle ground. The storm continues its movement until it completely fills the frame, covering the mountains and the sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot of a desert environment being overtaken by a powerful weather event. A massive, orange-brown wall of dust, characteristic of a haboob, rapidly advances from the left, creating a stark contrast with the vibrant, stormy blue sky visible on the right and the white, billowing clouds above. The arid landscape in the foreground is dotted with green desert shrubs and iconic saguaro cacti, which stand before a range of rugged, brown mountains that become progressively obscured by the advancing dust cloud. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the storm itself, emphasizing the environment over any specific object within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor desert landscape, a massive, brownish-orange dust storm advances across the scene, progressively engulfing a range of rocky, brown mountains in the background. The foreground features dry, brown earth with green desert shrubs and a few saguaro cacti. The sky is split, with the hazy, light-colored top of the dust cloud on the left and a stormy blue sky with white clouds on the right. The wall of dust moves steadily, eventually obscuring all of the mountains and sky as it progresses.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "bad_caption": "This video features a medium shot of a bustling city park, with the camera positioned at eye level. The foreground, occupying the lower center of the frame, shows a paved walkway lined with benches and street lamps. In the middle ground, several people are seated on the benches, while a group of children plays with a frisbee near the right edge of the frame. The background displays tall office buildings and leafy trees stretching across the top of the frame. At the start, a large white fountain is visible in the center, spraying water upward. As the video progresses, a group of cyclists enters from the left and moves diagonally toward the bottom right, briefly passing in front of the fountain and partially blocking the view of the benches. The camera remains stationary at the same height throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective on the park scene.",
