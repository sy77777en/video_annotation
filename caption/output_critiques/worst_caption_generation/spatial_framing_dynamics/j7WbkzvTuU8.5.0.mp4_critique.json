    "pre_caption": "The shot begins with the blurry, out-of-focus face of a man in the extreme foreground, filling the frame. In the middle ground, two kneeling men are visible and in focus; one is in the center-left, and the other is to his right. The foreground figure then moves out of the frame, transitioning the view to a medium shot of the two kneeling men, who remain in the middle ground. The camera, initially at the level of the foreground subject, is now positioned above the kneeling men, looking down at them on the dark, paneled floor that extends into the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The scene begins with the blurry, close-up face of an older man with gray hair and a dark mustache, who then moves out of view. This reveals two men kneeling on one knee. The man in the center-left is bald and light-skinned, wearing a black, high-collared tunic with a gold emblem on his chest; his head is bowed. To his left on the right side of the frame, another bald, light-skinned man kneels in a similar posture, wearing a white and gray high-collared tunic and a gray-black mask that covers the left side of his face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit, expansive indoor area, the scene unfolds on a dark gray floor composed of rectangular panels. Two bald men are kneeling in the mid-ground; one wears a black uniform with a gold chest emblem, and the other is in a white and gray outfit with a metallic mask covering the left side of his face. The shot begins with the blurry, out-of-focus face of a gray-haired man dominating the foreground, while the frame consistently remains focused on the two kneeling figures in the middle ground.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot features three people, with two in focus. It begins with a blurry close-up of a man in the foreground, while the head of another person is clearly visible behind him. As the man in the foreground moves out of the frame, a medium shot of the two people kneeling on one knee is revealed, occupying nearly 100% of the frame's height.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to above the subject.",

  "bad_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a single woman standing in the center of a brightly lit kitchen, occupying the middle ground and framed from head to toe. To her right in the background, a large window is visible, while a potted plant sits on the left edge of the frame in the foreground. The woman is positioned at the same height as the camera, which remains stationary at eye level throughout the scene. As the shot progresses, the woman walks toward the left side of the frame, passing behind the plant, and stops near the window, shifting her position from the center to the far left in the middle ground. No other subjects enter or exit the frame, and the spatial arrangement of the kitchen elements remains unchanged.",
