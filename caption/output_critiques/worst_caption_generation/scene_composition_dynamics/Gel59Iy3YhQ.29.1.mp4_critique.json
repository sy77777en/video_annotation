    "pre_caption": "A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, shows a descent into a dark, deep-sea cavern. The view is framed by the interior of a submersible, moving forward through murky green water filled with particulate matter. The cavern walls are dark and rocky, with a patch of yellow, brush-like flora visible on the left. In the distance, clusters of small, glowing blue orbs are scattered throughout the water. As the vehicle moves deeper, a long, skeletal creature swims past a large, dark, rectangular structure with glowing green lights on the right. Overlaying the scene is a heads-up display, with a compass and depth meter at the top center showing a depth increasing from 773m. On the left, an overlay indicates O2 levels, while on the right, another shows vehicle health, power, and the external temperature. Additional icons and an \"Exit\" prompt are visible at the bottom of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes.**\"",

  "bad_caption": "A third-person aerial view, captured by a drone, surveys a sprawling desert landscape at midday, with bright sunlight casting sharp shadows across the sand dunes. The terrain is dotted with clusters of tall, red sandstone pillars and occasional patches of dry, scrubby vegetation. In the center, a wide, shallow river with clear blue water winds through the scene, reflecting the sky. Several off-road vehicles, painted in bright orange and white, are parked near the riverbank, while a group of people in wide-brimmed hats and light clothing gather around a large, circular tent made of white canvas. Overlay elements include a map in the lower left corner showing the drone’s flight path, a battery indicator at the top right, and a timer counting up from zero at the bottom center. The camera slowly circles the area, revealing more of the desert expanse and the distant outline of a mountain range on the horizon.",
