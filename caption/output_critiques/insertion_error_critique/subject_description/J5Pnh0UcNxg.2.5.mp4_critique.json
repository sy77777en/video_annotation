    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot depicting a dark, narrow hallway at night, viewed from the deep shadows of an adjacent room. A faint, cool light from an unseen source dimly illuminates a white door at the end of the hall, while the foreground remains almost entirely obscured, revealing only the dark silhouette of a houseplant and the edge of a bed. The focus is on the unsettling atmosphere of the environment, using the low-key lighting and the partially obstructed viewpoint to create a sense of suspense rather than highlighting a specific subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
