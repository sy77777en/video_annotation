    "pre_caption": "This is a futuristic cityscape scenery shot, captured from an aerial perspective that pulls back to reveal the immense scale of the environment. The shot centers on a towering skyscraper with a unique, teardrop-shaped arch at its peak. Within this arch sits a luxurious rooftop terrace complete with a pool, lounge chairs, and palm trees. The building's facade is a sleek combination of glass and vertical fins, wrapping around tiered, curved floors. This architectural marvel is situated in a sprawling, modern city that extends into a vast desert landscape, interwoven with a complex network of highways and a winding waterway. The entire scene is bathed in the soft, warm glow of sunrise or sunset under a partly cloudy sky. The focus is on the grandeur of the architectural design and its integration into the vast, futuristic setting, making the overall atmosphere and scale the true subject rather than any single element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
