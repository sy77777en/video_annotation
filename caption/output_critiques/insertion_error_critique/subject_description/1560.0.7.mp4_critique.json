    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide waterscape scenery shot featuring the Statue of Liberty from a distance. The iconic, verdigris-green monument stands tall on its stone pedestal on Liberty Island, which is populated with bare winter trees and a few low-lying buildings. In the foreground, the dark, choppy water of the harbor ripples, while a hazy cityscape with various buildings is visible in the distant background under a pale blue sky with wispy clouds. The composition is framed to capture the entire environment, emphasizing the sense of place and scale rather than isolating a single main subject. The focus is on the overall atmosphere and the relationship between the landmark, the water, and the distant city.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
