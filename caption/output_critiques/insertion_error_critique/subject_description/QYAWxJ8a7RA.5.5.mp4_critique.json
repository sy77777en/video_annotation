    "pre_caption": "This video presents a bleak landscape scenery shot of a desolate and abandoned town. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on creating a pervasive atmosphere of decay and emptiness, with the composition encouraging the viewer to take in the entire desolate environment. In the foreground, a dark, single-story house with a broken window and a satellite dish sits on gravelly, debris-strewn ground. Behind it, a larger building and a prominent clock tower stand against a backdrop of hazy hills, while a lone utility pole punctuates the sky. Fine particles, resembling dust or ash, drift through the air, enhancing the scene's post-apocalyptic and somber tone under an overcast sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
