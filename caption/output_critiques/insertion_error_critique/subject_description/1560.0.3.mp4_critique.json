    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a large, illuminated Ferris wheel against the blackness of the night sky. The camera is positioned to capture the wheel head-on, emphasizing its perfect radial symmetry as its spokes, lit in warm yellow and orange hues, extend from a brilliantly glowing central hub. Along the outer circumference, each passenger cabin is marked by a triangular arrangement of bright red lights, creating a captivating, starburst-like pattern. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the mesmerizing visual pattern and vibrant atmosphere of the structure itself, rather than a specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
