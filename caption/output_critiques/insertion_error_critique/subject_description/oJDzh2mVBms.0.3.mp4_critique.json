    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static landscape scenery shot of a vast, snow-covered expanse under a clear twilight sky. In the middle ground, a white, multi-story building topped with a large, spherical radome stands alone, with a smaller dome visible nearby. A dark line of coniferous trees stretches across the horizon, separating the snowy field from the sky, which displays a striking gradient from deep blue at the top to a soft band of purple and pink just above the treeline. The composition emphasizes the immense scale and serene, cold atmosphere of the remote environment, making the overall landscape the focus rather than any single object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
