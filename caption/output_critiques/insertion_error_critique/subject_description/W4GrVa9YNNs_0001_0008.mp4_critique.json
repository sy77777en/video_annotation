    "pre_caption": "This video presents a tranquil rural scenery shot, characterized by a sunlit patch of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with dark centers in the foreground. Beyond the flowers, a white rail fence extends across a grassy field, with a large, brown wooden barn situated in the background. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the environment and the demonstration of a camera technique. The shot begins with the flowers in sharp detail and then shifts focus to the barn, intentionally guiding the viewer's attention through the depth of the scene rather than centering on one particular element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
