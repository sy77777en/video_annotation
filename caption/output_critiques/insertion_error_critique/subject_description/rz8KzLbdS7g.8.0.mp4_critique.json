    "pre_caption": "This is a streetscape scenery shot capturing a quiet residential lane in a Japanese town. The camera pans left along a narrow paved road, revealing traditional Japanese houses with dark tiled roofs and wooden facades. One prominent house features sliding glass doors and red curtains, fronted by a manicured pine tree and a small garden enclosed by a chain-link fence. The bright sunlight and clear blue sky with a few white clouds create a peaceful, sunny afternoon ambiance. The video lacks a central subject, as the camera's slow pan is designed to immerse the viewer in the tranquil atmosphere and architectural character of the neighborhood rather than focusing on a specific entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
