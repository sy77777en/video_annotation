    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a majestic rock spire against a backdrop of sprawling canyons and mountains under a clear, blue sky. The central spire is a weathered, layered rock formation, wider at the top, with sparse vegetation clinging to its sides. In the distance, layers of mountains and canyons fade into the horizon, while a dense, green forest covers the plateau to the right. The composition emphasizes the grand scale and serene atmosphere of the natural environment. The shot's primary purpose is to convey the vastness of the landscape rather than focusing on a single subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
