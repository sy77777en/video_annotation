    "pre_caption": "This video presents a seascape and underwater scenery shot, beginning at the surface of clear, turquoise water looking towards a lush, green tropical island with a mountainous backdrop under a blue sky dotted with white clouds. The perspective then dips below the surface, revealing a sunlit underwater environment with a sandy and rocky seabed scattered with coral. There is no main subject in this video because the focus is on capturing the expansive natural environment and immersing the viewer in the serene atmosphere of the location. The shot emphasizes the scale and beauty of the tropical setting, both above and below the water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
