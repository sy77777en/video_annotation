    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot that slowly zooms out to reveal a detailed cross-section of a vast, multi-level building. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and intricate, symmetrical design of the structure, creating a formal and imposing atmosphere. The dimly lit interior shows numerous rooms across several floors, including various auditoriums with white or blue tiered seating, and a central, wood-paneled chamber containing an altar-like table. At the bottom level, a large hall features a mural and two simple benches. As the camera pulls back, the building's stark, fortress-like exterior is revealed, reinforcing the sense of a grand and sterile institution.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
