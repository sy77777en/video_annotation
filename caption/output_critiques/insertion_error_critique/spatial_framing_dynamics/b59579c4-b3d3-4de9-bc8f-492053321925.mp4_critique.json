    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a man is positioned in the center-right of the frame, running away from the camera in the middle ground along an elevated roadway that recedes into the background. To his left, a row of yellow streetlights extends from the middle ground into the background. To his right, a yellow barrier with a blue railing runs from the middle ground into the background, with a single yellow light structure positioned above it. A cityscape is visible in the distant background across the frame. The camera is positioned at the man's level, maintaining a consistent distance as it follows him from behind.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short, dark hair and a beard is seen from the rear side as he runs. He is wearing athletic attire, which includes a dark blue, long-sleeved top with bright yellow sleeves and a small white package or equipment tied to his left upper arm, and dark, tight-fitting running pants.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor urban setting at dusk, a person runs along an elevated roadway. The scene is characterized by a striking contrast between the blue sky, the grey-blue tone of the paved road, and the bright yellow of the surrounding structures. On the left side of the asphalt path, a row of modern, yellow streetlights is visible. On the right, a single yellow structure with a light source stands out. Long, yellow concrete barriers line both sides of the road, adorned with graffiti and topped by a blue metal railing, enhancing the vivid contrast with the yellow structures. In the background, the faint lights of a city are visible beneath the blue sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
