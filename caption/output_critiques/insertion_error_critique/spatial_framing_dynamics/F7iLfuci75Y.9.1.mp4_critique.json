    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, showing the upper body of a humanoid figure from behind, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The back of an office chair occupies the foreground, partially obscuring the figure. A computer monitor is situated directly in front of the figure in the middle ground. In the top left of the frame, a clock hangs on a wall, also in the middle ground, with large window-like panels in the background. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, slowly moves to the right. This movement causes the figure and monitor to shift from the center towards the left side of the frame, while the clock moves to a more central position above the figure's head.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A humanoid robot with a shiny, metallic-looking head is shown from behind, sitting in a black office chair at a desk. The robot is wearing a form-fitting black top, and its hair is styled in a bun. It faces a computer monitor with a glowing light blue screen that briefly displays a windowed logo. To the left and above the robot, a black, circular, analog clock with a minimalist design hangs on the wall; it has no numbers, only thin white lines for markers and matching white hands.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a modern, minimalist office with a cool-toned color scheme. From a perspective behind a dark office chair, a figure is seated at a desk, facing a computer monitor that displays a blue screen. The background consists of large, dark-framed panels showing a cloudy, overcast sky above a distant, silhouetted cityscape. Mounted on a dark wall to the left of the monitor is a black, circular clock with white hands and markers, spinning rapidly, making it impossible to discern a fixed time. The environment is characterized by dark furniture and the ambient blue light from the monitor and the view outside.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a blurry humanoid figure sitting at a computer, with their upper body visible and a clear clock on the wall. As the camera moves from left to right, both the person and the clock remain in the frame. The clock ticks rapidly, suggesting the passage of time.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
