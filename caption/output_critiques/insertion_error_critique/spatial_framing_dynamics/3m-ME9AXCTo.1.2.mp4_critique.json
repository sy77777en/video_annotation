    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot begins framed from behind the woman's right shoulder, with her hair in the foreground. The camera then moves to capture the couple in the center of the frame as they slow dance. Their gentle, circular movement causes the perspective to continuously shift, alternating between views of their faces and the backs of their heads. The man is positioned primarily on the right and the woman on the left. In the background, star-shaped decorations and multicolored lights hang above them. The camera remains at the subjects' level, moving with them to maintain the central framing throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man and a woman are slow dancing closely together. The man has curly, shoulder-length blonde hair and is wearing a light gray suit paired with a matching bowtie and a white flower on his lapel. The woman has long, straight blonde hair and is wearing a light-colored, sleeveless dress or top. They are holding each other, looking into each other's eyes, and appear to be in conversation as they dance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors at a dimly lit dance. The background features dark stage curtains with folds that cover the entire wall. Hanging from the ceiling are festive decorations, including glittery, silver, star-shaped cutouts and tinsel, along with strings of small, multicolored lights. The space is bathed in a hazy glow from prominent purple, red, green, and yellow stage lights, which create soft focus and bright lens flares as a couple slow dances in the center of the room.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
