    "pre_caption": "A full shot displays a white airplane in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, flying toward the camera. In the top left background, the sun is visible, while a landscape is seen at the bottom of the frame, also in the background. A text overlay is positioned at the bottom of the frame in the foreground. As the clip progresses, the airplane begins a slow turn to its left. The camera, initially at the airplane's level, moves to a position slightly above the aircraft, providing a higher-angle view by the end of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white commercial jet airplane is shown from a front-three-quarters perspective, appearing to fly toward the viewer. The plane has two engines mounted under its wings and winglets that curve upward at the wingtips. In the upper left, a bright, circular, yellowish-white sun is visible. At the bottom of the scene, a black bar contains text. The text begins with \"AUS TWR:\" in a yellow serif font, followed by \"Southwest 708, you can turn left heading 170.\" in a white sans-serif font.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A white passenger airplane is shown flying through a hazy, reddish-orange sky during sunrise or sunset, with a bright sun visible in the upper left. Below the aircraft, a landscape with a grid of roads or runways is faintly visible. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays text. The text \"AUS TWR:\" appears in yellow, followed by the white text \"Southwest 708, you can turn left heading 170.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
