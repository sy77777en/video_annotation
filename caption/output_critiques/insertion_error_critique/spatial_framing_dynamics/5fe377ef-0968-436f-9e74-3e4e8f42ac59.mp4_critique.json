    "pre_caption": "The shot begins as a low-angle close-up of the foreground, showing the red running track moving rapidly toward the camera. The camera then tilts up and moves forward, revealing a woman in a crouched position over a starting block, positioned centrally in the middle ground, which transitions the framing to a wide shot. The woman then sprints forward, moving away from the camera and toward the right side of the frame. The camera, remaining at a low height, follows her from behind, and the framing tightens from a wide shot to a medium shot of the runner. Throughout the shot, a green field occupies the left side of the frame in the middle ground, while a building, a flag, and trees are situated in the background across the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a woman with a dark complexion and dark hair tied up in a bun. She is wearing athletic clothing, specifically a black sports bra and black leggings. When she first comes into view, she is in a sprinter's crouch over a gray starting block on a red running track, and then she begins to run forward toward the right side of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a clear day at an outdoor athletic facility, a person in dark athletic attire sprints down a red, all-weather running track marked with white lines. The track encircles a green grass field, where yellow lines are visible. A set of grey starting blocks sits on the track surface. In the background, a building with a circular logo, an American flag on a pole, and tall green trees are visible under a bright sky. The camera initially follows the runner from the rear side and transitions to a side view at the end, capturing the motion with a slight blur.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera starts shooting the ground running track, which is a close-up shot. Then the camera tilts up and moves forward to show a running woman as it moves forward. The wide shot gradually changes to a medium shot of her.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject.",
