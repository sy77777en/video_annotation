    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide, top-down shot, a section of an airport at night occupies the top right of the frame, while a dark body of water fills the remaining space on the left and bottom. In the middle ground, three stationary airplanes are positioned on the illuminated taxiways within the airport area. A fourth airplane is also in the middle ground, located on the left side of the frame, and is shown flying horizontally from left to right over the water, moving toward the airport. The camera remains static and positioned directly above the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a top-down animated view of an airport at night, three white commercial airplanes are positioned in a line on a helipad at the top right corner of the frame, all stationary along a taxiway marked by glowing green dots. On the left side of the frame, a fourth white commercial airplane is visible flying from left to right towards the three stationary airplanes, rather than heading towards the brightly lit runway.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A top-down view captures a section of an airport at night, situated next to a dark body of water. In the top right corner, the airport tarmac is illuminated, featuring a runway with bright white lights and taxiways outlined in green. Three white airplanes are positioned on the taxiways. A fourth white airplane is seen in flight over the dark water on the left. Green dashed lines and an arrow are overlaid on the ground, tracing a path along the taxiway.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
