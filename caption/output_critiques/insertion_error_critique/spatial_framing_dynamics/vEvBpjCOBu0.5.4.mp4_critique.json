    "pre_caption": "This static, low-angle shot captures an abstract, dark environment. A flat surface extends from the middle ground into the background, strewn with small, geometric shards that are scattered from the foreground to the middle ground. A large, out-of-focus angular piece is positioned in the middle ground, extending from the left side of the frame toward the center. In the background, the tip of a dark, pointed object is visible in the top right corner. The camera's low position, looking up and across the scene, combined with a shallow depth of field, blurs the elements in the immediate foreground and the distant background, creating a sense of depth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This abstract, computer-generated animation features a dark gray, flat surface covered with numerous small, sharp, angular fragments of the same gray material. These fragments have a polygonal, crystalline appearance and are scattered across the scene, some resting on the main surface. In the upper right corner, the tip of a larger, dark, pointed object with a smooth, somewhat reflective surface is visible. The scene is dimly lit, with a strong light source originating from the lower left, which creates bright highlights on the edges of the fragments.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an abstract, dark environment, a flat, dark surface is strewn with small, grey, geometric shards. A large, angular piece of the same material is positioned in the distance, near the upper middle of the frame. In the top right corner, the tip of a larger, dark, pointed object is visible, characterized by a smooth surface with a slight reflective texture. The scene is illuminated by a low-angle light source from the left, which creates bright highlights on the edges of the objects and casts deep shadows against the solid black background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
