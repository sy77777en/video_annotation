    "pre_caption": "A high-angle wide shot frames a cartoon character standing in the middle ground, centrally positioned on a grassy path. To the left, in the middle ground, a white picket fence encloses a tilled garden plot. On the right, another picket fence and a row of stylized trees occupy the middle ground, with a small wooden sign positioned in the foreground at the bottom right. The foreground is overlaid with UI elements, including a coin counter in the bottom-left corner, an inventory bar at the bottom center, and two meters in the bottom-right corner. The character then walks from the center of the frame toward the top left, moving along the path next to the garden fence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A cartoon-like character stands in a grassy area, distinguished by its atypical, hand-drawn appearance. The character has a perfectly round, orange head with two simple black dots for eyes and a thin, curved line for a smile. It wears a simple, purple hooded cloak that covers its entire torso, with only its thin, stick-like legs visible. The trees in the scene also have a stylized, non-realistic look, with thick black outlines and simplified, blocky green foliage. A small, hand-written wooden sign at the base of a tree reads \"DO NOT TOUCH DEERS\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, a small, cloaked character walks along a grassy path in a cartoonish outdoor setting during dawn or dusk, casting a long shadow. The path is bordered on the left by a pinkish picket fence enclosing a plot of tilled brown soil, and on the right by another picket fence and a line of dark green, stylized trees. The green lawn is dotted with small red, purple, and orange flowers, tree stumps, and a fallen log. A small wooden sign near the trees reads \"DO NOT TOUCH DEERS.\" The scene includes several overlay elements: in the bottom-left corner, a gold coin icon is displayed next to the number 22. At the bottom-center is a vintage wooden inventory bar divided into left and right sections. The left section contains five item slots, displaying two bags with different crop seeds: a beige bag for red flowers and a green bag for yellow flowers, both with a quantity of 0. The right section has three tool slots, holding branch-shaped items, vine-shaped items, and a pink orb. When the character interacts with a vine-shaped object on the ground, the quantity of the vine-shaped item in the inventory increases from 0 to 1. In the bottom-right corner, two vertical, cylindrical meters—one blue and one transparent and empty—are set in a gold-colored holder.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
