    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot from a high angle positioned above the subject, initially framing a pumpkin-headed character standing in the center middle ground on a wooden dock. To the left in the foreground, a fishing rod rests near the water, while a boat is moored in the middle right. In the top background, a stone well and a deer are situated on a grassy lawn. As the character walks upward and slightly left along the dock towards the shore, the camera pans upward to follow the movement. The character steps onto the grass and proceeds towards a garden plot, shifting the focus from the water to the land. By the end of the sequence, the character stands in the center of the frame near the garden plot in the middle left, with the well now located in the middle right and the dock moved out of the frame at the bottom.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A cartoon character with a round, orange, pumpkin-like head featuring simple, oval-shaped light brown eyes and a carved smile is depicted. The character's body is concealed by a purple hooded cloak, from which thin, brown, stick-like legs protrude, with no arms visible. In the same scene, a cartoon-style deer with a brown coat and antlers stands near a well. A fishing rod, also rendered in a cartoonish style with a large, dark-colored reel, is propped up on a wooden dock.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video with a cartoonish, cel-shaded art style, the scene is set in a tranquil, grassy area next to a body of turquoise water. A wooden dock, where a small boat is moored and a fishing rod is propped up, extends over the water. The grassy landscape features a stone well encircled by a brick path, a deer, trees, and light brown picket fences. A small, fenced-in garden plot contains rows of green plants. Overlay elements are visible on the screen: in the bottom left corner, a gold coin icon displays the number 315; a horizontal inventory bar is at the bottom center; and two vertical blue and yellow status bars are in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
