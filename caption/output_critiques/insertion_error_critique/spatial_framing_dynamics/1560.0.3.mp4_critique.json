    "pre_caption": "This scenery video presents a wide shot of a large, illuminated Ferris wheel centered in the frame against the dark night sky in the background. Initially, the camera is positioned at a high angle, capturing the wheel from a head-on perspective. As the Ferris wheel rotates clockwise in the middle ground, the camera simultaneously rotates counter-clockwise. This movement causes the perspective to shift from the initial high-angle view to a more sideways, level-angle view of the structure, which remains the central element throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a large, illuminated Ferris wheel against the blackness of the night sky. The camera is positioned to capture the wheel head-on, emphasizing its perfect radial symmetry as its spokes, lit in warm yellow and orange hues, extend from a brilliantly glowing central hub. Along the outer circumference, each passenger cabin is marked by a triangular arrangement of bright red lights, creating a captivating, starburst-like pattern. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the mesmerizing visual pattern and vibrant atmosphere of the structure itself, rather than a specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a perspective looking directly up from below, a large Ferris wheel rotates against a dark night sky. The structure is brightly illuminated, with yellow and gold lights lining the numerous spokes that radiate from a glowing central hub. The outer rim also features these golden lights, while the passenger cars are distinguished by glowing red, triangular-shaped lights. The center of the wheel shines with a bright, circular white and yellow light, creating a kaleidoscopic pattern as it turns.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
