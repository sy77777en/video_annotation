    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot, a person is positioned in the center of the frame, standing in the middle ground at the core of a large spiral pattern on the ground. As the camera slowly ascends directly upward, the shot transitions into an extreme wide shot. The person remains stationary in the center of the frame, becoming smaller as the camera pulls back to reveal the full scale of the spiral labyrinth and the surrounding grassy clearing, with trees entering the frame from the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high-angle, bird's-eye perspective, a person wearing a dark suit jacket and dark trousers stands in the center of a large spiral pattern in a grassy field. They are looking down at the ground. The spiral is composed of paths of brown earth or dead grass that wind through patches of green and brown grass. As the camera moves upward, more of the intricate, multi-layered spiral design is revealed, with the person remaining stationary at its very center.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a high-angle, top-down view of an outdoor clearing where a large spiral labyrinth is etched into the ground. The paths of the labyrinth are made of brown earth, contrasting with the surrounding patches of green and dry brown grass. At the center of the spiral, a person wearing a dark suit stands on a small mound of taller, yellowish, dry grass. A small, square block is visible on the ground near the center, and a few small, white, rounded objects are scattered in the outer areas of the pattern. The clearing is bordered by trees on one side, and the drone slowly ascends, gradually revealing the full scale of the labyrinth.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
