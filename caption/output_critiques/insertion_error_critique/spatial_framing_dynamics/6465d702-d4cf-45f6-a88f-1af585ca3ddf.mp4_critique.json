    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot is framed from the perspective of a backseat passenger, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. A driver is seen from behind, occupying the left and center foreground, with his eyes reflected in the rearview mirror at the top center of the frame. To his right, a passenger is positioned in the right foreground. The black headrests of the front seats are in the bottom foreground, framing the lower portion of the shot. Through the windshield in the middle ground, a city street with trees and buildings is visible in the background. As the car moves forward, the background scenery shifts, while the subjects inside the car maintain their fixed positions relative to the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a backseat perspective inside a car, a man with short, dark hair is seen from behind, driving. He is wearing a green short-sleeved shirt, and his eyes are visible in the rearview mirror. To his right, in the passenger seat, sits another person with dark hair, wearing a light-colored, plaid short-sleeved shirt. This passenger is also viewed from behind and from the side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing interior perspective from inside a car captures the road ahead during daylight. The dark interior frames the view, showing the driver and front passenger in the foreground, along with the black headrests of the two front seats and a dark gray dashboard. A central rearview mirror reflects the driver's eyes, and a small, round, gold-colored ornament hangs from it. Through the windshield, which has a blue-tinted sun strip across the top, a paved city street is visible, lined with green, leafy trees and buildings in the background as the car moves forward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
