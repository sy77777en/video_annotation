    "pre_caption": "This wide shot initially frames two tandem skydivers in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, with a dark landscape visible in the background far below. The camera, positioned above the subjects, transitions to a position below them. In the final framing, the skydivers remain in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, now positioned against the sky in the background. The subjects rotate slightly during the transition, moving from a downward-facing orientation to a more horizontal one relative to the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two men are shown skydiving in tandem. The man in the front is light-skinned and bald. He wears a green jumpsuit and has his arms spread wide with a smile on his face. Strapped to his back is another man, who wears a dark jumpsuit, a dark helmet, and sunglasses or goggles. The man in the back holds a small, dark camera in one hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors, high in the sky during either dawn or dusk. Two people in tandem are in freefall, positioned horizontally against a vast, dark landscape far below. A thin yellow strap extends upward from a package attached to the individual above. The sky above the horizon transitions from a deep blue to a warm orange and yellow gradient. The entire scene is presented within a dark, rounded-corner frame, giving it a vintage film aesthetic.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to below the subject.",
