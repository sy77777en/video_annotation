    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot from a high angle, initially out of focus, capturing the top of a person's head in the bottom foreground. As the camera lifts slightly, the scene sharpens, revealing a desk's surface. The final composition is a static high-angle shot. The person's silhouetted head occupies the bottom center foreground. In the middle ground, a map is centered in the frame, with the person's hands resting on its left and right sides. Additional documents are positioned in the left middle ground, while a stack of papers is in the right middle ground. At the top center of the frame, also in the middle ground, are two stacked books. A bright, direct light from above illuminates the central area of the desk, casting the person into shadow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An overhead shot shows a person with dark, short hair and pale skin, wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt. The person is seated at a wooden desk, looking down at a collection of documents. Their hands are placed on either side of a rectangular paper map that lies in the center of the desk. As the scene comes into focus, the map is revealed to have black lines depicting borders and topography, with the word \"MANCHURIA\" visible at the top. To the left of the map are several sheets of paper with printed text, while a stack of papers sits to the right. Near the top of the desk, two books are stacked, one with a tan cover on top of another with a reddish-brown cover. The desk is illuminated by a single, bright light source from above.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an overhead perspective, a person is seen from behind, sitting at a wooden desk in a dimly lit setting. A single, warm light source directly above casts a bright circle on the desk's surface, leaving the person as a dark silhouette. Centered in the light is a map of Manchuria, with the person's hands resting on either side of it. The map displays dark lines on light paper. To the left of the map are several documents with visible text, while a stack of papers and two stacked, hard-covered books sit to the right and top of the frame, respectively. In the lower left corner of the frame, overlay white text reads \"[10]\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot capturing the top half of a man's head and the papers on the desk in front of him. Initially, everything is out of focus. As the camera is lifted, the papers on the desk gradually come into focus.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
