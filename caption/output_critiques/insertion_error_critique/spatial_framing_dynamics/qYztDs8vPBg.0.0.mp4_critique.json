    "pre_caption": "A static, close-up, top-down shot captures a collection of items arranged on a white surface, viewed from directly overhead. In the center of the frame and the middle ground, a pair of hands holds a white smartphone box. A silver pry tool is positioned in the top-left middle ground, with five colorful plastic rods directly below it. An orange lighter sits in the bottom-left middle ground. In the top-right middle ground, a digital caliper is placed diagonally, while a blue utility knife occupies the bottom-right corner. To the immediate right of the central box, four pin vises are arranged in the middle ground. Several small, dark metal fragments are positioned in the middle ground, forming a loose rectangle that frames the central box.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pair of light-skinned male hands, one wearing a silver ring, holds a white rectangular box at the center of a white surface. The box has an image of a dark smartphone with a swirling orange and black wallpaper. A collection of tools and items is arranged around the box. In the top left corner is a silver rectangular pry tool with \"JerryRigEverything\" printed in black, and just below it are five thin plastic rods in red, orange, blue, green, and yellow. An orange Bic lighter sits in the bottom left. To the right of the box are four pin vises with interchangeable blades, featuring clear, faceted handles and colored rings. Above the pin vises, in the top right, is a silver and black digital caliper, and below them, in the bottom right, is a utility knife with a blue textured handle and a silver body. Several small, dark, and slightly burnt-looking metal fragments, some straight and others curved, are positioned in a loose rectangle directly around the central phone box.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot where the camera is positioned directly above the subject for a top-down perspective shows a collection of tools and a smartphone box arranged on a plain white surface. In the center, a pair of hands holds a white box printed with an image of a dark-colored smartphone featuring an orange and gold circular graphic on its screen. Scattered around the box are six small, dark, and seemingly burnt metal fragments, all roughly the same size. To the left of the box are a white rectangular tool with \"JerryRigEverything\" printed in black, a set of five colorful plastic rods in red, orange, blue, green, and yellow, and an orange BIC lighter. To the right are a silver digital caliper, a blue-handled utility knife, and a pin vise with interchangeable blades featuring clear handles and colored bands.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
