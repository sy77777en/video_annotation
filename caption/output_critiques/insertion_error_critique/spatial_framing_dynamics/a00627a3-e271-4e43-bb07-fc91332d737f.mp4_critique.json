    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a blurry, indeterminate shot featuring a dark silhouette in the center-left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. In the background, out-of-focus lights are visible, including a long horizontal white light in the upper-middle, a circular light to its right, and colored lights along the top edge. The silhouette then moves forward and toward the center of the frame, transitioning the shot into a close-up that places the person's head in the foreground, centered in the composition. As the subject moves closer, the camera is positioned at the person's height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a heavily blurred, dark silhouette of a person, which gradually comes into closer, though still indistinct, out-of-focus. The subject is revealed to be a man, initially more fully visible and later shown from the neck up as he gets closer to the camera while facing forward. Due to the extreme blur and dim, multicolored lighting, his facial features, skin tone, and clothing are completely obscured, though he appears to have short hair.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A heavily blurred and textured scene is depicted in a dimly lit environment, dominated by indoor light sources. The background features abstract, out-of-focus lights, including long white bars and circular glows, with hints of red, blue, and purple light along the top. The view is covered by a grainy filter. A dark, indistinct silhouette of a person moves into the center of the composition.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera begins with a blurring shot, making it difficult to determine the shot type and size. As the camera moves forward towards a man, it transitions to a close up shot focusing on the man in the foreground.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera begins with a blurring shot, making it difficult to determine the height relative to the subject. As the camera moves forward towards a man, the camera is at the man's height.",
