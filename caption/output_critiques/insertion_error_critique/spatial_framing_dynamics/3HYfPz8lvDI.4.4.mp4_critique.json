    "pre_caption": "This static extreme wide shot captures a cityscape from a low-angle perspective. A prominent modern skyscraper is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground and extending towards the top. In the foreground and middle ground, the tops of older, traditional buildings are visible across the bottom of the frame, framing the base of the skyscraper from the bottom left, bottom center, and bottom right. The bright, hazy sky serves as the background, filling the upper half of the composition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a low-angle perspective of a prominent modern skyscraper. The building features a distinctive curved, top-heavy design with a facade of reflective glass and a grid-like pattern, set against a bright, hazy sky. In the foreground and midground, the tops of older, more traditional stone buildings with numerous windows and chimneys frame the base of the skyscraper. The composition lacks a singular main subject, instead focusing on the architectural contrast and the immense scale of the modern structure in relation to its historic urban surroundings, thereby creating a powerful sense of place and atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective, a towering modern skyscraper known as the \"Walkie-Talkie\" dominates the view against a bright, hazy sky. The building features a distinctive curved facade of glass and steel that bulges outwards towards its flat top. In the foreground and midground, the darker, ornate rooftops of older stone buildings are visible, providing a sharp architectural contrast. Vignette effects are present in the corners of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
