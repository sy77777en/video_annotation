    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a woman is positioned on the left side of the frame and a man is in the center-right, both located in the middle ground. A red light source is visible in the left foreground, while a large lens flare occupies the right foreground. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, follows as the man and woman, holding hands, move forward and deeper into the background. This movement keeps the man relatively centered in the frame while the red light on the left moves out of view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit setting, a woman and a man are holding hands. The woman, facing partially forward, has long black hair with bangs and is smiling. She is wearing a dark, long-sleeved top and dark shorts. The man, with his back mostly to the viewer, is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved jacket over a white shirt and dark pants. They appear to be moving together.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a third-person over-the-hip POV shot framing a character from the hip up, the scene unfolds within a dark indoor space. A woman in dark clothing moves slightly ahead, holding the hand of a person in a light-colored jacket as they navigate through the dimly lit passage. The low-light environment is punctuated by a soft red glow from an object on the left, which moves out of view later due to camera movements, and a large, warm-toned, blurry light flare that streaks across the right side of the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
