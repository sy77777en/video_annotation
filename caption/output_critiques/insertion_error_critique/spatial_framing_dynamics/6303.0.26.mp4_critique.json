    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an inverted close-up shot, with a basketball featuring a face centered in the foreground. A hand holds the ball from the bottom right of the frame, while the top of the frame is occupied by the person's torso and hair. The camera then executes a simultaneous clockwise rotation and pullback. This movement corrects the inverted view to an upright perspective and transitions the framing to a low-angle medium full shot. In the final composition, the woman is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene. In the background, a basketball hoop is visible in the top right, a graffiti-covered wall is on the left, and residential buildings are in the far background. Other people are scattered in the middle ground and background on the court.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a unique basketball and a young Black woman. The basketball is standard orange with a pebbled texture and black lines, but it has been modified to include a sculpted, expressive human face. The face has indented oval eyes and, at first, a wide-open mouth showing white teeth and a tongue, which later changes to a closed-mouth smile. The person holding the ball is a young woman with a dark complexion and long, thin black braids. She wears a light gray sweatshirt, blue sweatpants, and a blue baseball cap backward. A blue wire from her earphones is visible around her neck. She holds the basketball under her right arm, and her visible hand has long nails with greenish-gold polish and a ring. She stands smiling broadly.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on an outdoor basketball court with a reddish-brown surface under a cloudy, daytime sky. The perspective begins at a level angle, rotates clockwise to an inverted view focused on an orange basketball with a sculpted, expressive human face, and then transitions back to an upright, low-angle view. In the background, a basketball hoop, trees with autumn leaves, and multi-story residential buildings are visible. A wall adjacent to the court is covered in colorful graffiti, and other people can be seen in the distance on the court.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of a basketball featuring a face, held by a Black person who only reveals one hand and part of their body. As the camera moves, it eventually presents a medium full shot of the person standing on a basketball court.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
