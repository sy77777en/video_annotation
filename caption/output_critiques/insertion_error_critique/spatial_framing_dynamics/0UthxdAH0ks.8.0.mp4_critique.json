    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground, shown in profile facing right. To his left and in the background, a boy is seated. A large red object occupies the right foreground, while a soft lamp is visible in the left background. The man then leans forward, stands, and moves toward the camera, his form briefly filling the frame before he exits to the left, leaving the shot mostly dark. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's level throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit setting, a middle-aged man of East Asian descent with short, dark hair is seen in profile, sitting and facing towards the right while smoking. He is wearing a black, short-sleeved shirt. To his left and in the background, a young boy, also appearing to be of East Asian descent, with short dark hair and wearing a light-colored shirt, sits with his head bowed, looking down. The man leans forward, stands up, and walks toward the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds in a dimly lit indoor space with a dark, warm ambiance. Prominently positioned in the foreground is red seating, possibly a booth, partially visible on the right and in the background. A man in a black shirt is seated in profile at a table, his presence dominating much of the shot. Another person is visible further back and to the left. A soft, out-of-focus circular lamp glows in the background. As the man leans forward and stands up towards the end, he remains within the frame. The overall lighting is low, with most of the scene cast in shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
