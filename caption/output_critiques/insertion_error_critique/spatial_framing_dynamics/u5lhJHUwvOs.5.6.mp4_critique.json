    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up of a man in profile, occupying the right foreground. The camera then performs a clockwise arc around him. As it moves, a second man enters the frame in the middle ground on the left. Concurrently, the main subject turns away from the camera, and the shot widens to a medium shot, placing him in the center foreground with his back to the viewer. The second man stays in the middle ground to the left, and the full back wall of a court is revealed in the background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man with short, platinum-blonde hair, wearing black-rimmed glasses and a black sleeveless tank top. He is initially seen with his head down and his profile visible, appearing to march in place. He then turns to his right as the camera moves in a clockwise arc around him, ultimately capturing a medium shot of his back. A second man with dark hair, wearing a dark t-shirt and light-colored pants, appears in the background, holding a racquet in his left hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a view of a squash court, where a thin red line is visible in the upper-left corner of the frame. As the camera moves in a clockwise arc, it reveals a distant white wall with a thin red line running horizontally across its center, and another red line at the bottom. Below both ends of this bottom red line, two identical yellow and black banners with circular logos are displayed. A young man with bleached blonde hair and glasses, wearing a black tank top, turns around and eventually faces the distant white wall. In the background, another individual holding a squash racket briefly appears before exiting to the left.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
