    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot with no main subject, focusing on the landscape. The video opens with the camera aimed at the sky, where a rainbow arcs across the top of the frame in the middle ground. The rest of the frame is filled with grey clouds in the middle ground and background. The camera then tilts downward, revealing a vast landscape that fills the bottom half of the frame. In the final composition, the sky and the rainbow remain in the top half, while rolling green hills covered in trees occupy the foreground and middle ground below. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking out over the expansive terrain.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a sweeping landscape scenery shot, beginning with a view of a vibrant rainbow arcing across a dramatic sky filled with a mix of dark, heavy clouds and patches of bright blue. The camera smoothly tilts downward and pans to the right, effectively revealing a sprawling, verdant landscape of rolling hills covered in lush green trees and foliage. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment. The focus is on the striking visual of the rainbow over the expansive terrain rather than any specific object within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video opens on a vibrant rainbow arcing across a cloudy, grey sky. The view then tilts downward and pans to the right to reveal an expansive landscape of lush, rolling green hills covered in trees. The sky above the hills is a mix of dark clouds and patches of blue. The full arc of the rainbow stretches across the vista, with one end appearing to descend among the forested hills.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
