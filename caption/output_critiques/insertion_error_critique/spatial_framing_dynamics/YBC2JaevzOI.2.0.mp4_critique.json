    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a dark, nighttime street scene. Initially, a dimly lit road is visible in the middle ground on the right, with a faint vehicle receding into the background. The camera then pans slowly to the left, bringing a different section of the road into view in the middle ground on the left side of the frame. A car with illuminated red taillights is positioned on this left-side road, moving away from the camera and receding into the background. The center of the frame remains predominantly dark, creating a visual separation between the two portions of the road. The camera is positioned at a standard height relative to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dark, nighttime streetscape scene. Initially, some vehicles are faintly discernible further down the road on the right side of the frame. As the camera pans to the left, a car with glowing red taillights becomes visible on the left side. These two portions of the dimly lit road are separated by an area of darkness, where only a tiny, faint red light glows in the latter part of the video. The focus is on the quiet, almost desolate atmosphere of the nocturnal environment, with the sparse points of light from the cars accentuating the pervasive darkness rather than drawing attention to the vehicles themselves.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark outdoor setting at night, a paved road is faintly visible. As the camera pans from right to left, two sections of the road become visible, separated by an area of darkness. In this dark area, a faint red light is visible in the latter part of the video. On the right side of the road, trees are dimly illuminated. A car with glowing red taillights is seen on the left, driving away from the camera and receding into the surrounding darkness. The scene is almost entirely black, with only minimal light defining the road and foliage.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
