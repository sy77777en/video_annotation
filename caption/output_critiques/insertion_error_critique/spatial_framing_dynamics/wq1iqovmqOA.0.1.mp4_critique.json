    "pre_caption": "The video opens on a blurry, out-of-focus close-up of a subject on the right side of the frame, with a blue light in the background on the left. The camera then executes a swift pan to the left, simultaneously pulling focus to a second subject, a bald man, who comes into a clear close-up in the left-center of the frame. As the focus shifts, the first subject becomes a blurry figure in the background on the far right. In the final framing, a series of out-of-focus circular blue lights occupy the background on the left, while a warm light source is visible in the background to the right of the second subject. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens with a shallow depth of field, highlighting a young, light-skinned man in a green and white striped collared shirt. The camera then swiftly pans to the left, bringing a middle-aged, light-skinned bald man into focus, who is wearing a dark collared shirt and looking forward with a neutral expression in a dimly lit setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a young man prominently featured in the foreground. Behind him, a blue glow is visible on the left side of the frame, while a warm yellow glow appears in the upper right corner. As the camera quickly pans to the left, the young man exits the frame from the right side. Simultaneously, a bald man enters from the left, and the focus transitions to him. The scene is set within a dark, indoor environment, with a dimly lit atmosphere. At the end, in the background, a series of out-of-focus circular bokeh lights create a cyan-blue halo effect, complemented by an additional warm yellow light source visible in the distance. The overall color palette is dark, dominated by blues, greens, and shadows.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
