    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a Pan Am Boeing 747 is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground on a runway that extends from the bottom of the frame into the background. The camera is positioned at the airplane's level, slightly to its right and front. As the video begins, the airplane moves forward along the runway, and the camera tracks alongside it, maintaining a consistent spatial relationship and framing throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white, blue, and gray Pan Am Boeing 747 airplane is positioned on a gray runway marked with white lines. The aircraft's fuselage is white on the top half and dark gray on the bottom, with a thin blue stripe separating the two sections. The name \"PAN AM\" is written in large, black, sans-serif capital letters on the side, above a row of small passenger windows. The tail is white and features a blue circular logo. The plane has multiple engines, with three fully visible from the camera's perspective, mounted under its long, swept-back wings. Its landing gear is down, with multiple wheels visible under the wings and fuselage.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stylized, monochromatic setting with a dark gray background, a Pan Am Boeing 747 moves along a gray asphalt runway marked with white lines. The aircraft's fuselage is white on the top half and dark gray on the bottom, with a thin blue stripe separating the two sections. The name \"PAN AM\" is written on the side, above a row of small passenger windows. The airline's blue circular logo is also visible on the plane's tail fin.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
