    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle, medium-long shot of a large, industrial-style structure occupying the upper-left and center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. The structure then begins to deconstruct, with its walls and roof breaking into numerous fragments that fly outwards, scattering across the foreground, middle ground, and background, primarily moving toward the bottom-right of the frame. As the building disintegrates, a vast grid of small, square objects is revealed on the floor, occupying the center and right of the frame and extending from the middle ground into the background. The camera appears to pull back slightly, transitioning to a wider long shot to accommodate the expanding debris field, ultimately showing the remaining building sections in the upper-left and the newly exposed grid of objects across the center and right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, dark, industrial-style structure, composed of gray and brown panels, is shown against a black background. The top of the rectangular building features details like circular vents and ductwork. The structure begins to deconstruct, with its walls and components breaking apart into numerous smaller, irregular fragments that fly outwards, predominantly moving toward the lower-right area of the frame. This process reveals the interior, which contains a vast, orderly grid of small, square, light-brown objects resembling wooden pallets, all arranged neatly on a dark floor marked with white grid lines. The building continues to disassemble until the grid of pallets, scattered debris, but portions of the building that remain intact are visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, undefined space, a large, rectangular, industrial-style structure with dark paneled walls and rooftop vents sits on a floor marked with a grid. The structure violently deconstructs, its walls and roof shattering into fragments that fly outwards, progressively revealing what was inside. This process uncovers a vast, orderly grid of smaller, light-colored square pallets laid out on the floor. An overlay of white text appears on a black background in the lower-left corner of the frame and reads \"[13.15]\". The scene is lit from above, casting a spotlight on the deconstructing building and the grid of pallets.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows the part of a structure resembling a factory building. Initially, it appears intact, but soon, it gradually breaks apart into fragments, revealing some block-like pieces inside.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
