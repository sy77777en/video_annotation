    "pre_caption": "The video starts as a full shot with a woman in a white robe positioned in the middle ground, slightly left of center. The out-of-focus hair of a second woman occupies the left foreground, while a television is visible in the background on the right. The camera then pulls back, and the focus simultaneously shifts from the first woman to the second. This transition reframes the scene into a medium shot, with the second woman, now applying lipstick, becoming the main subject in the center of the middle ground. The first woman is now in the out-of-focus background on the left, and the back of another person's head appears in the out-of-focus left foreground. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level throughout the entire sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with an eye-level camera angle, showing a blonde woman with voluminous, curly hair, wearing a white robe and smiling. In the foreground, the hair of another blonde woman is visible, but she is not looking at the first woman. The scene starts with deep focus, where both the midground and background are clear, while the foreground is out of focus. As the camera moves backward, the focus shifts to the woman in the foreground, blurring the background. As the camera continues to move, the woman in focus transitions to the midground, and another blurred woman appears in the foreground. On the television in the background, a man with reddish hair in a white shirt stands behind a counter with a neon sign that reads \"CRAZY\" on the first line and \"CHARL\" on the second.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit bedroom during the evening. A television on a TV cabinet is on, displaying a program featuring a man and a neon sign that reads \"CRAZY\" on the first line and \"CHARL\" on the second. To the right of the television, a floor lamp with a white, pleated shade is illuminated. In the background, an open closet reveals a collection of hanging clothes. In the middle ground, to the left of the center of the frame, a woman in white sleepwear is seated. Initially appearing in the left foreground, a woman in a white robe is applying lipstick at a table in the middle of the room. As the camera moves backward, she transitions to a middle ground position near the center of the image. The table holds various items, including glasses, a mug, and cosmetic products. Another woman is partially visible in the foreground, with her back to the viewer.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
