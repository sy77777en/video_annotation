    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot is framed from behind a person with curly hair, who occupies the center foreground. Directly across from them in the middle ground is a woman in a yellow top. To the right of the main subject, another person is partially visible in the right foreground. In the left background, other patrons are seated at different tables. The camera executes a slight clockwise rotation, which shifts the woman in the yellow top from the center to the left side of the frame and brings more of the background window into view. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video primarily shows the back of a person with voluminous, dark, curly hair, who is wearing a green and brown camouflage-patterned shirt. This individual is seated and gesturing with their hands while talking. Seated across from them is a woman with long, straight, light brown hair and bangs, who is wearing a yellow top. She is listening and at one point puts something in her mouth. To the right of the main subject, a woman with light skin and brown hair, dressed in a bright pink top, is holding a small piece of food in her right hand. In the background, an older man with graying hair in a light-colored collared shirt can be seen sitting at a different table, along with other figures present.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a brightly lit diner or casual restaurant during the daytime. The camera is positioned behind a person with dark, curly hair who is wearing a camouflage-patterned shirt. Seated at the table are two women: one directly across wearing a yellow top, with long, straight brown hair and bangs, and another to the right in a pink top. The interior walls are cluttered with various pictures and posters. Numerous other patrons are seated at different tables, contributing to the casual atmosphere of the eatery. At the beginning of the video, two men are visible on the left side, and later, a woman by the window and a man wearing a hat opposite her are seen as the camera rotates clockwise. The large window in the background offers a view of trees and vehicles on the street outside.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
