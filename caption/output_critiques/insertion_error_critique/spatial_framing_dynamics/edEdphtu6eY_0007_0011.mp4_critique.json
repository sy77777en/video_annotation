    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a marina from an elevated perspective. A large building on stilts is positioned in the right-center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. To its left, rows of covered boat slips extend from the middle ground towards the left edge of the frame. In the bottom-left foreground, docks and smaller boats are visible. The background is composed of a body of water, with a distant shoreline and city skyline on the right and a plume of smoke rising in the top-left. The camera slowly zooms out, causing the building to become a smaller element within the frame as the shot widens to reveal more of the marina in the foreground and the expansive harbor and distant landscape in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a waterfront scenery shot of a large marina on a cloudy, overcast day. A prominent two-story, gray-sided building with a white metal roof stands on pilings over the calm, reflective water, featuring a wraparound balcony and large windows. To its left and behind, long rows of covered boat slips with matching white roofs shelter numerous vessels. The marina is densely populated with sailboats, their tall masts creating a forest-like pattern against the water. In the background, on the right side of the frame along the tree-lined shore, a distant city skyline with several high-rise buildings is visible. Mountains are visible in the further distance across the frame. The camera's slow view captures the expansive scale and tranquil, muted atmosphere of the location, making the environment itself the subject rather than any specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an elevated, observational perspective, the scene captures a large marina under a grey, overcast sky. In the foreground, a two-story building with a gabled, grey metal roof and matching siding is constructed on stilts over the calm, reflective water. Adjacent and behind this building are long rows of white, covered boat slips housing numerous sailboats. To the right side of the frame, a distant shoreline is visible with trees and several tall residential towers. A plume of white smoke or a columnar cloud formation connecting to the ground rises in the far distance as the camera slowly zooms out to reveal a wider view of the harbor.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
