    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot focused on a woman in the background at the bottom right of the frame. An out-of-focus man occupies the foreground, positioned from the left to the center, while another woman appears in the midground on the left. The focus then racks from the background to the foreground, shifting the shot to a close-up of the man, who is now sharply defined in the center of the frame. As the focus shifts, both the woman in the background and the woman in the midground become blurred. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout this transition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with the focus transitioning from the middle ground to a dark silhouette of a woman at the distant staircase in the bottom right of the background. In the middle ground, another woman with long hair, dressed in black, is seen walking out of a door on the left side. As the focus shifts, both women become blurred. The focus then shifts to a young, light-skinned man in the foreground, who is initially blurry. He has short, dark hair and is seen in profile, wearing a dark jacket over a light blue collared shirt. As the focus racks, the man becomes sharp and clear. Midway through the video, an image of a man wearing sunglasses and a red leather jacket briefly appears and then disappears in the bottom right corner of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor night scene is set on a city street next to a stone building with foliage overhead. In the background, a dimly lit alley is visible, containing a distant figure and a sign that reads \"SLOW.\" In the midground, a woman with long hair, dressed in black, exits through a door on the left side of the scene. The focus of the shot shifts from the background figure to a man in the foreground, bringing his profile into sharp relief against the now-blurry alley. The scene is characterized by its dark, cool-toned lighting. Overlays are present at the bottom of the screen: in the lower-left corner, the white text \"RACK FOCUS\" appears next to a purple icon. Midway through the video, an overlay briefly appears in the bottom right corner, depicting a sticker of a man wearing sunglasses and a red leather jacket, before quickly disappearing. The text \"FIGHT CLUB (1999)\" is displayed in the lower-right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
