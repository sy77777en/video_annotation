    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of architectural scenery, captured from a high-angle, top-down perspective. The focus is on the ruined environment rather than a specific subject. In the foreground, a large grey beam extends horizontally across the upper portion of the frame. Below it, a framework of white metal trusses occupies the top left and left side of the view, acting as a middle-ground element. On the right side, a grid of light-colored beams is also positioned in the middle ground. The background is dominated by a shattered grey floor, with a concentration of dark rubble visible in the center-left area. The camera remains stationary high above the scene, looking straight down into the destroyed interior.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an architectural scenery shot depicting the aftermath of destruction within a large, modern structure. From a bird's eye view, the camera looks down past massive grey and beige structural beams onto a desolate expanse of shattered grey concrete below. Dark, scorched-looking rubble is concentrated in the left-center of the floor, while bright light streams in from a large window on the left, illuminating the ruined interior. There is no main subject, as the bird's eye view is designed to convey the immense scale and atmosphere of the devastation. The focus is on the ruined environment itself rather than any specific entity within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye angle, the interior of a large, modern structure is shown in a state of disrepair. A prominent gray metal beam crosses the upper portion of the view, with a complex framework of white metal trusses below it on the left. Through this framework, a gray floor is visible, marked by a large area of dark, shattered debris and extensive cracking. To the right, a different architectural element features a grid of light-colored vertical and horizontal beams.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
