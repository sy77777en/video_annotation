    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a group of men occupies the middle ground, spanning the center of the frame. On the right, a man in the middle ground sprays a bottle toward the center, with the liquid spray filling the space between the foreground and middle ground. A man, initially positioned center-left, moves toward the center of the frame, where he takes a bottle and lifts it to drink, occupying the central vertical space. Another man remains on the far left in the middle ground, while others are clustered centrally. Throughout the shot, the group remains in the middle ground as the spray continues to erupt from the right. Out-of-focus skyscrapers are visible in the background, filling the upper portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of men in business attire are celebrating outdoors. A man on the right, with dark hair and a light-colored, long-sleeved button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up past his elbows, is laughing as he shakes and sprays a bottle of what appears to be champagne over the group. In the center-left, a Black man wearing a white button-down shirt and dark pants takes a bottle and drinks from it. To the left, another Black man in a light-colored suit over a white shirt is laughing. Another man with glasses is visible in the center of the group, laughing as he gets sprayed. All the men and their clothing are wet from the celebration.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor urban setting with tall, out-of-focus skyscrapers in the background, a group of men in white shirts are being drenched by a spray of liquid from bottles. The air is filled with a shower of droplets, soaking their clothing as they celebrate amidst the city architecture. The scene is captured during the day under what appears to be an overcast sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
