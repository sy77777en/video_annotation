    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot with no main subject, focusing on the landscape and atmospheric conditions. The composition is horizontally divided, with a flat, golden prairie occupying the bottom third of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the middle ground horizon. The top two-thirds of the frame are filled by the sky in the background. A massive cumulonimbus cloud formation dominates the center and right of the frame, with its dark base positioned in the middle ground just above the horizon and its bright, billowing top extending high into the background. The camera remains static throughout the time-lapse, capturing the subtle expansion and shifting of the cloud's edges as it develops over the stationary landscape. The camera is positioned at a low height relative to the vast prairie.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a time-lapse landscape scenery shot of a vast, golden prairie under a deep blue sky. A massive, billowing white cumulonimbus cloud with a dark, flat base dominates the frame, indicating an approaching storm. There is no main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale of the natural environment and the dramatic atmospheric conditions over a specific focal point. The focus is on the powerful interplay between the expansive, flat earth and the dynamic, towering cloud formation above it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene captures a vast, golden-brown prairie stretching to a low horizon under a dramatic sky. The upper portion of the sky is a deep, clear blue, which contrasts with a massive, white cumulonimbus cloud formation that dominates the view. The top of the cloud is bright and billowy, while its base is a darker, shadowy gray, suggesting a distant storm. The flat, expansive landscape emphasizes the immense scale of the weather formation above.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
