    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, the rear passenger-side wheel of a gold vintage car is positioned in the center of the frame, with the car's body occupying the upper portion. The car is in the foreground, while a building is partially visible in the background on the left. The camera, positioned at the wheel's level, maintains a tilted angle as it rotates counter-clockwise around the wheel, which is the central point of the rotation. As the camera circles, the car simultaneously moves slowly backward, causing the background elements to shift their position within the frame from the bottom left towards the top left. The entire shot pivots around the car's hubcap, keeping it as the consistent focal point throughout the circular camera movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up view highlights the front passenger side of a vintage car. The vehicle's body is a metallic gold color, featuring a thin chrome trim line running horizontally along its side. The tire is distinguished by a thick whitewall stripe and is adorned with a silver-colored hubcap. This hubcap has a prominent design with three fin-like spokes radiating from a central emblem, all enclosed within a vented outer ring. Part of the front bumper is visible, showing a two-tone design with a silver upper portion and a dark blue lower section.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The camera circles the rear wheel of a vintage, gold-colored car moving forward on a dark, paved surface in what appears to be a residential driveway. The car features a chrome trim line along its side and a muted blue-gray front bumper. Its rear wheel is fitted with a whitewall tire and a silver-colored, three-spoke hubcap with a central emblem. In the background, a portion of a building with light-colored siding and blue-trimmed windows is visible, along with a small plant. The entire scene is captured with a tilted, rotating perspective in cool, dim lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
