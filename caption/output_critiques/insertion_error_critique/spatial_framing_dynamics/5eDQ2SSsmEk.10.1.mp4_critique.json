    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a futuristic cityscape, framed from a low angle looking up at a large, dark building that occupies the center and left of the middle ground. On the left side of this building, a large billboard and a smaller \"SUSHI\" sign below it are visible. A tall, vertical yellow neon light is positioned high up on the building, slightly right of center, while a cluster of smaller lights juts out to its left. Powerful beams of light cut through the atmosphere from the top left and from behind the structure. In the bottom-right foreground, the top of a vehicle is partially visible, while faint lights from distant buildings occupy the background, creating depth in the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This moody cityscape captures a dark, futuristic urban environment drenched by heavy rain at night. A large building prominently features a cylindrical structure on the right and a geometric solid on the left, adding architectural complexity to the scene. Intense light emanates from behind the building, significantly enhancing the dramatic atmosphere. Powerful spotlights illuminate the structure, their beams cutting through the thick, foggy air. Attached to the building is a large billboard with Asian characters advertising beer, and a smaller glowing \"SUSHI\" sign underneath. The scene is bathed in a cool, blue-teal light, creating a dystopian and atmospheric mood, punctuated by a single vertical yellow neon light high up on the structure. The focus is on the immersive, cyberpunk setting rather than a specific character or object, with a partially visible vehicle in the foreground adding to the sense of place.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, futuristic city at night, heavy rain falls through the hazy atmosphere. The scene is dominated by a large, dark, multi-sided building illuminated by powerful, blue-tinged spotlights that cast visible beams through the downpour. The building features a cylindrical structure on the right and a geometric solid on the left. On the left, a large billboard displays an advertisement for beer with Asian characters, situated above a smaller sign for \"SUSHI.\" A tall, thin, glowing yellow neon light is positioned on the right side of the building and extends vertically from the building's center. Below the neon light, a cluster of smaller lights is located on the right side of the building. In the bottom-right corner of the foreground, the wet, dark top of a vehicle with red lights is visible; initially, the side and rear parts of the car are visible, but as the shot progresses, only the roof remains visible. The small, bright particles are actually the lights from the tall buildings in the background, shining through the steady rain.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
