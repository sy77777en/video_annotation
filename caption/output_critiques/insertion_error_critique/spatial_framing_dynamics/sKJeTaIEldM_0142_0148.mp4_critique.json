    "pre_caption": "In an initial medium close-up, a person is positioned in the bottom-left foreground, viewed from behind. In the background, a white door is centered at the far end of a long hallway. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, slowly pulls backward. As the camera moves, the shot transitions into a medium shot, causing the person to appear smaller within the frame. This backward dolly movement makes the hallway seem to lengthen, with the door in the background receding further into the center of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with dark, shoulder-length hair is seen from behind, standing still. They are wearing an orange and white jersey-style top with the number \"65\" visible in white on the back. The person is positioned in the foreground, facing a white, paneled door at the end of a long, dark hallway, which is illuminated by a bright orange glow around its frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the setting is a long, dark, and narrow indoor hallway. A character wearing an orange and white jersey stands still on the carpeted floor. The walls are lined with dark, vertical panels or curtains, creating a sense of receding depth. At the far end of the corridor, a single white, paneled door is prominently outlined by a bright, warm orange glow that emanates from its frame. This light is the primary source of illumination, casting a glow on the floor directly in front of the door while the rest of the hallway remains in deep shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
