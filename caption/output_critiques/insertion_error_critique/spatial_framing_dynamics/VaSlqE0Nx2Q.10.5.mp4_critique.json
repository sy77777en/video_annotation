    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle close-up shot, a small hand emerges from the foreground darkness at the bottom center of the frame. It moves upward toward a lit, textured surface that occupies the top half of the frame in the middle ground. As the small hand ascends, a larger hand enters the frame from the top left, coming to rest in the center of the lit area. Simultaneously, the curved edge of a plate enters from the top right. The small hand continues its movement, gently placing itself on top of the larger hand in the center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a high-contrast, black-and-white scene, a small hand, likely a child's, wearing a dark, ribbed sweater cuff, reaches up from the bottom of the frame. A larger, more weathered adult hand, emerging from a dark, thick-textured sleeve on the left, appears from the top of the frame due to camera movement. The adult's hand remains still throughout the video, while the child's hand gradually reaches up to gently rest on the adult's hand before moving away.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stark, black and white indoor scene, viewed from a bird's-eye view, a textured fabric surface is illuminated by a single light source, creating deep shadows. From the darkness at the bottom of the frame, a small hand with a ribbed cuff on its sleeve slowly rises. The larger hand remains still on the lit surface, entering the frame from the top center due to camera movement. The small hand gradually reaches up to the surface, rests slightly on the larger hand for a moment, and then withdraws. Initially invisible, a partially visible plate or bowl with a curved edge and indistinct texture or color also appears from the top due to camera movement, eventually positioned to the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
