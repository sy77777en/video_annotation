    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is framed from the water's surface, creating a split view with the rocky seabed in the foreground at the bottom and the sky in the background at the top. Initially, a woman is positioned in the middle ground to the left of center, and a man is slightly further back in the middle ground to the right of center, with a beach and huts visible in the background on the right. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, bobs as a wave moves from the middle ground toward the foreground, briefly submerging the lens and obscuring the subjects and the background. As the wave passes, the man is revealed more centrally in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two people are in clear, turquoise water, visible from the shoulders up. The individual on the left has dark hair and a darker complexion, while the individual on the right also has dark hair, a darker complexion, and is wearing yellow swimming goggles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a perspective at the water's surface, the scene captures a tropical beach on a bright, sunny day. The camera provides a split view, showing the clear, turquoise ocean and the deep blue sky dotted with a few white clouds. Below the gently rippling surface, the rocky seabed is visible through the transparent water. In the background, a white sand beach is lined with conical, thatched-roof huts, and behind them is a lush green forest. Two people are visible in the water, positioned between the camera and the distant shoreline.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
