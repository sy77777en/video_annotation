    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot, presented from a top-down perspective, initially frames a pixelated character in the middle ground on the left side of a grassy landscape. A large body of water occupies the center and right of the frame, with a broken wooden bridge visible on the far right. As the character walks downwards, the camera pans down and slightly to the right. This movement reveals a dilapidated wooden house in the middle ground, which comes to rest in the bottom-center of the frame, situated between the character and a cliff edge at the bottom. A waterfall also becomes visible in the bottom right. Throughout the video, user interface elements remain fixed in the foreground, with a clock in the top right corner and a toolbar at the bottom center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel-art scene, a character with light skin and short, spiky gray hair stands on a grassy area. The character wears a red short-sleeved shirt, blue pants, and brown shoes. To the right of the character is a dilapidated wooden house with a red roof and a door boarded up with planks. To the right of the land where the character is standing, there is another piece of land separated by a blue body of water, with a small grassy island in the middle. Wooden planks form bridges connecting the two sides. A user interface is visible, with a clock in the top-right corner indicating the time is 4:10 PM on Monday the 1st, and a toolbar at the bottom displays icons for a scythe, pickaxe, and axe.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows a pixel-art landscape during the late afternoon. The scene, rendered in a vibrant, blocky style, features a lush green grassy area bordered by brown cliffs on one side and a wide blue body of water on the other, with a sandy beach in between. Pine trees and green bushes are scattered across the land. As the camera pans downward, it reveals a small, weathered wooden house with a red roof near the cliff's edge and a wooden bridge extending over the water. A character with red clothing walks southward through the grassy area toward the house. Overlays are visible on the screen: in the top right corner, a display shows the date, with the time progressing from 4:10 PM to 4:20 PM and then to 4:30 PM, along with in-game currency. A toolbar with tool icons is centered at the bottom, with an inventory item initially displaying \"fiber\" on the left, which subsequently disappears, and an energy bar on the right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
