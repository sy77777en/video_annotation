    "pre_caption": "The video opens with the camera panning right from behind a horse in the foreground to reveal a woman in the middle ground, positioned in the center of the frame. As she walks forward and toward the left, the camera tracks her movement. A group of men carrying a stretcher enters from the right background and moves across the middle ground to the left, passing in front of the woman and briefly obscuring her. She reappears, now positioned in the center-left of the frame, as a second group of men with another stretcher follows the same path from right to left, again crossing in front of her. Throughout the shot, dark horses and harnesses remain in the foreground, while a large, covered wagon is visible in the right background, creating a layered and deep composition. The camera maintains a medium full shot at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a fair-skinned woman with reddish-brown hair, who is seen walking forward throughout the scene. She wears a long-sleeved, pink patterned dress with a corset-style top that matches the color of her dress, transitioning to brown at the hem. Her large, wide-brimmed, light-colored hat features a green strap tied under her chin. She maintains a consistently worried expression as she encounters a group of men in grey and tan military-style uniforms. These men walk past her, carrying two wooden stretchers with wounded men lying on them, one after the other. The scene is crowded with other men in similar attire, as well as dark-colored horses or mules harnessed to wagons, including a large covered wagon in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds on a bustling, unpaved street in a historical town during the daytime. In the background, a brick building is partially visible. The dusty street is crowded with people, including soldiers in a combination of gray and tan military-style uniforms, and dark horses pulling various wagons. A large, canvas-covered wagon is prominent in the scene as soldiers carry two wooden stretchers with wounded men lying on them, proceeding one after the other through the throng. A woman, wearing a pink dress and a wide-brimmed, light-colored hat, is seen walking on the active thoroughfare.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
