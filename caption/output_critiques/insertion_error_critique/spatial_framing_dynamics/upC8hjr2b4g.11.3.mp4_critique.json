    "pre_caption": "This is a static, low-angle full shot where the camera is positioned on the floor in the foreground, looking up at three white, low-polygon figures standing in the center background at the end of a long hallway. A male figure is on the left, a female figure is on the right, and a smaller figure is positioned between them. The dark walls of the hallway occupy the left and right sides of the frame, creating a symmetrical composition that recedes from the foreground to the background, drawing the viewer's eye toward the centrally placed subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, a woman, and another adult male, all rendered in a white, low-polygon, faceted style, stand with their backs to the viewer. The man on the left wears a long-sleeved shirt and trousers. The woman on the right has her hair in a bun and is dressed in a peplum top, a skirt, and high heels, holding a bag in front of her with her hands obscured. Positioned slightly further into the scene between them, the adult male has a bag slung over his right shoulder. The three figures, resembling paper sculptures, are all facing away from the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective, the scene looks down a long, dimly lit indoor hallway bathed in a blue-green light. The walls have dark paneling at the bottom, with tall, mullioned windows set on the upper half on both sides. The smooth, light-colored floor has a slight sheen, reflecting the cool light. In the middle of the corridor, standing in front of a dimly lit section, are three white, low-poly, sculptural figures seen from behind: a man on the left, another male figure slightly further into the scene, and a woman holding a bag on the right. An overlay of white text appears at the bottom left of the screen, reading \"[24]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
