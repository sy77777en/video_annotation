    "pre_caption": "The video depicts a woman making a phone call inside a car in a setting with abundant greenery. Approximately half of the car's body is visible, along with the woman's head and hand through the window. The scene is framed by dense green hedges in the foreground, positioned on the left and right sides of the frame. The silver car occupies the middle ground, centered horizontally. The woman is seen in the driver's seat, also in the center of the frame. Through the car's windows, a background of more foliage is visible. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the shot is static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with fair skin and reddish-brown hair pulled back is seen sitting in the driver's seat of a silver station wagon. She wears a dark, high-collared shirt and holds a black cell phone to her right ear with her right hand. Her facial expression is distressed as she speaks on the phone. The car, viewed from the side with the driver's window open, is partially visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a daytime outdoor setting, the scene is framed by the dark green, dense foliage of tall hedges on either side. A silver station wagon is parked between the hedges, with its driver's side window open. The car's light-colored paint contrasts with the surrounding greenery. Through the car's windows, a background of more trees and lush vegetation is visible under a bright sky. A woman is seated in the driver's seat, holding a phone to her ear.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video depicts a woman making a phone call inside a car in a setting with abundant greenery. Approximately half of the car's body is visible, along with the woman's head and hand through the window.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
