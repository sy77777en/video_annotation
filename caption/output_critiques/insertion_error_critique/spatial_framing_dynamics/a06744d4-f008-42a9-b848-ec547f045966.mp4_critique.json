    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures a man from an extreme low-angle, worm's-eye view using a fisheye lens. Initially, the man is positioned upside down in the center of the frame, with the sole of his left shoe occupying the top left foreground. His body is in the middle ground, with his head at the bottom center, and a tree is visible in the top left background against the sky. The entire frame then rotates roughly 180 degrees, reorienting the man to an upright position in the center. In the final framing, his head is in the top center, and the sole of his right shoe is now prominent in the bottom right foreground, while the tree has moved to the bottom left background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with a light skin tone is shown from a worm's-eye view, fisheye perspective. He wears a dark-colored t-shirt with white lettering, loose-fitting green pants, and a light-colored bucket hat. On his feet are white sneakers with dark, patterned soles. He is in a crouching position, looking down toward the camera while wearing sunglasses and holding his hands out with his fingers slightly curled.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a worm's-eye view with fisheye distortion, an outdoor scene unfolds during the daytime under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The distorted, circular view captures a person wearing green pants, a dark t-shirt, and a light-colored bucket hat, who is positioned directly over the camera and looking down. Their white sneakers with dark, circular-patterned soles are exaggerated in the foreground. The green foliage of a tree is visible at the edge of the frame. The entire scene is enclosed by a black border created by the lens, and faint white lines resembling scratches on transparent glass overlay the frame, while lens flare with chromatic aberration creates a subtle rainbow-like distortion.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
