    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing a group of people walking along a stone-paved sidewalk that runs parallel to a street. The main group of pedestrians is positioned in the center and slightly right of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground as they move away from the camera, which is at approximately their eye level. Additional people are visible further along the sidewalk in the middle ground and background, distributed from the center to the far right of the frame. On the left side of the frame, across the street in the middle ground and background, more pedestrians are seen near the entrance of a building with a red awning. A black car moves from left to right in the middle ground, partially overlapping with the crosswalk at the bottom left. The sidewalk, street, and buildings with red awnings extend from the foreground into the background, creating depth. Trees and utility poles line the right side of the frame, with their trunks and branches occupying the right foreground and middle ground. The camera maintains a consistent height and angle, moving forward in a steady first-person perspective, causing the spatial positions of the people and elements to gradually shift backward in the frame as the camera advances.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a group of people walking along a stone-paved sidewalk beside a street. The group includes men and women of varying ages, most dressed in casual clothing such as jackets, sweaters, and long pants, with some carrying backpacks or shoulder bags. One man wears a brown jacket and beige pants, while a woman nearby wears a red jacket and black pants. Other individuals are visible further along the sidewalk and across the street, some walking in pairs or small groups. A black car is continuously moving on the street, and several people are passing by near the entrance of a building with a red awning. The overall scene features a mix of pedestrians, with no single subject emphasized.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, moves along a stone-paved sidewalk beside a street lined with traditional-style buildings featuring wooden facades and red awnings. The setting is outdoors in a lively urban area, with groups of people walking on the sidewalk and others gathered near storefronts. The time of day is late afternoon, indicated by the long shadows and warm sunlight. Trees with sparse leaves line the walkway, and a crosswalk with white painted stripes is visible. A black vehicle is moving along the road, and street signs and utility poles are present along the road. The sky is mostly clear with a few scattered clouds, and the overall atmosphere is calm and orderly. No overlays such as text or icons are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
