    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot where a multi-lane city street occupies the left side of the frame, extending from the bottom foreground into the distant background. A large building is positioned in the right middle ground. A bright light then emerges in the background on the left, creating a blue haze. The shot abruptly transitions via a rack focus to a close-up, bringing two thick metal cables into sharp focus in the immediate foreground, where they run diagonally across the frame. The city scene, previously the main subject, is now relegated to the background, appearing as a soft, out-of-focus bokeh pattern. The camera is positioned at a level angle relative to the subject in focus in both the initial and final compositions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A level, nighttime view of a multi-lane city street is flanked by tall, dark buildings with illuminated windows. The street is lined with rows of glowing streetlights, and cars with red taillights and white headlights are visible on the road. A bright, white light then flares up in the distance, creating a blueish haze. The focus abruptly shifts to the immediate foreground, revealing two thick, dark, twisted metal cables running diagonally. The city street and its lights become completely out of focus, appearing as a soft, blue-tinted bokeh background behind the sharply detailed cables.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a level-angle perspective at night, a wide, multi-lane city street is flanked by tall, dark buildings with some illuminated windows. Rows of streetlights cast a yellow glow on the pavement, where cars with red taillights and white headlights are moving. In the distance, a helicopter approaches, casting a blue-tinged light over the area. As the light is directed straight at the camera, it creates a harsh white glare accompanied by a circular blue halo. The light then shifts to illuminate the right side of the frame, forming a blue-hued beam that extends across the entire view. The focus then shifts to a close-up of the cable closest to the camera, with the distant city lights appearing as blurred, out-of-focus circles in the blue-hued background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
