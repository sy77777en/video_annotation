    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme close-up of a large, out-of-focus tennis ball that dominates the foreground from the left to the center of the frame. In the background on the right, a blurred figure of a woman is visible on the tennis court. The ball then moves rapidly away from the camera toward the background, briefly coming into sharp focus as it travels. Simultaneously, the woman moves from the background toward the middle ground on the right side of the frame, swinging a racket. The shot effectively widens to encompass both the ball and the player before the ball is struck and exits the frame, leaving the blurred figure of the woman in the middle ground. The camera remains positioned at the subject's level throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The primary subject is a large yellow tennis ball, initially out of focus with its white seam faintly visible. In the midground, a heavily blurred figure of a woman stands in a tennis-playing stance, wearing a blue tank top and light-colored shorts while holding a tennis racket. The woman briefly moves into the foreground before exiting the frame as the camera shifts. During the video, the tennis ball briefly comes into sharp focus for a short period.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a dimly lit indoor tennis court. A large, yellow-green tennis ball, initially rendered in soft focus, briefly comes into sharp focus, its white seam partially visible. Beyond the ball, the teal ground stretches into a shadowy background where the dark teal wall of the court, with a brown upper part and a briefly visible window, fills most of the frame. The blurred figure of a person stands in a ready stance in the midground. The overall lighting is low, creating a dark and moody atmosphere.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a medium shot of the tennis ball, then turns into a wide shot as the ball flies away, and finally the ball is hit out of the frame, making the entire video out of focus.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
