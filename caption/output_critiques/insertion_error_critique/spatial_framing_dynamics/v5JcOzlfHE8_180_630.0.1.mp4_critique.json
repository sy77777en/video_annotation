    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up of a woman from behind, positioned centrally in the blurred foreground, against a wide shot of the room. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. Initially, a staircase occupies the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, while a kitchen is visible in the background through a central pass-through. As the woman turns her body to the right, the camera pans slightly in the same direction. This movement shifts the composition, bringing a round dining table and chairs in the right middle ground more into view, along with a window seat on the far right. A candelabra light fixture hangs in the top center-right of the middle ground, while the staircase remains on the left and the kitchen pass-through shifts to the center-left of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a woman from the back, positioned in the foreground and slightly out of focus. She has shoulder-length, wavy, gray hair. She is wearing a dark, long-sleeved top. The woman is standing and facing away from the camera, looking into the room in front of her.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, follows a person with gray, shoulder-length hair who turns to her right while remaining in place. The setting appears to be a living and dining area, with a staircase on the left and a round wooden dining table with chairs on the right side of the room. A pass-through opening reveals a kitchen in the background where red heart-shaped decorations are hanging. To the right, a carved pumpkin sits on a window seat. The scene is characterized by a desaturated color palette and a distinct visual distortion effect, combining color and black-and-white chromatic aberration, giving the footage a glitchy, vintage look, particularly around the window and a black candelabra light fixture.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a clear background scene with a blurred woman in the foreground. The camera is positioned behind the woman, presenting a medium close-up shot of her, with a wide shot of the scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
