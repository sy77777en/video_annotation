    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot from a worm's-eye view, positioned at the bottom of a multi-story, rectangular stairwell looking directly up. There are no main subjects, as the focus is on the architectural space. The central opening of the stairwell recedes into the background at the top center of the frame, creating a sense of depth. The railings and landings of the lowest floor are in the foreground, framing the bottom and sides of the shot, while the structures of the floors above form layered, progressively smaller rectangles in the middle ground. The camera slowly rotates counter-clockwise, causing the entire geometric structure to tilt and appear to spiral within the frame, dynamically shifting the composition's diagonal lines.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot looking up from the bottom of a multi-story, rectangular stairwell, creating a dizzying, vertiginous perspective. The view spirals upwards, framed by the repeating geometry of dark, ornate wrought-iron railings and dark brown support columns set against warm, orange-toned walls. White elements of the building add contrast to the scene. There is no main subject because the focus is on conveying the scale and atmosphere of the interior space. The shot's purpose is to highlight the architectural design and create a sense of immense height, rather than to center on a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video employs a worm's-eye view to capture the interior of a multi-story, square stairwell, enhancing the sense of depth and highlighting the architectural details. The walls are painted a warm orange, contrasting with the off-white trim on each ascending floor. Dark, ornate wrought-iron railings with a circular motif and dark wooden handrails enclose the central opening on every level. The scene slowly rotates, creating a spiraling effect that draws the eye upward through the repeating geometric patterns under warm, ambient lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
