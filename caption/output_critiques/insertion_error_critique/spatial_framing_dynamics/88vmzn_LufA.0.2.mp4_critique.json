    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle wide shot, a city street stretches from the top to the bottom of the frame, flanked by tall buildings on the left and right. A white police car is positioned in the foreground at the bottom center, while a presidential motorcade of black vehicles occupies the middle ground, arranged in a line extending from the center towards the top of the frame. The entire convoy moves from the top of the frame toward the bottom. As the vehicles advance, the camera tilts down and zooms in, transitioning to a full shot that centers on the lead black limousines as they move from the middle ground into the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From an aerial perspective, a presidential motorcade travels down a city street in a single-file line. The motorcade features two long, black, armored Cadillac limousines, known as presidential state cars, surrounded by a convoy of several identical black SUVs. One of the black SUVs, positioned near the front of the main group, has a small, flashing blue light on its roof. Further down the road, ahead of the main convoy, is a white police sedan with \"POLICE\" written in blue letters on its side and a light bar on its roof. The vehicles are driving through an intersection marked with white crosswalks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, a sunlit city street is flanked by tall, modern buildings with glass and concrete exteriors. The bright daylight casts long, distinct shadows across the multi-lane asphalt road, which is marked with white dashed lines and a pedestrian crosswalk at an intersection. A motorcade, consisting of several black SUVs and sedans, travels down the street, preceded by a white police car. The convoy moves steadily through the intersection, continuing along the urban corridor. Sidewalks, streetlights, and traffic signals are visible along the route.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
