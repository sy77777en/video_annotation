    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme close-up of a black horse's legs in motion, positioned in the top center of the frame in the foreground against a blurred paved surface. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning the view into a medium shot. This movement reveals a rider, with the horse and rider now occupying the center of the frame in the middle ground. The paved road stretches from the foreground to the middle ground. In the background, a street sign and a building are visible on the left, while green bushes and trees are on the right. The camera is positioned at the level of the horse and rider.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person rides a black horse on a paved surface. The horse is equipped with a black bridle and a brown leather saddle. The rider is dressed in a yellow hat, yellow clothing, yellow pants, and yellow boots, with their boots positioned in the stirrups.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place outdoors on a light-colored paved road during the day. A black horse, outfitted with a brown leather saddle and a black harness, trots along the road, its legs showing motion blur. Initially, the rider is out of view, but as the camera tilts upward, the rider gradually becomes visible, culminating in a medium shot of the person sitting on the horse, wearing bright yellow pants and matching yellow boots. In the background, there are green bushes, trees, multiple white buildings, and a streetlight on a pole.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
