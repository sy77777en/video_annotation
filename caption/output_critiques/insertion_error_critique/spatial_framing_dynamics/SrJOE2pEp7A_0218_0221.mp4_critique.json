    "pre_caption": "A collection of cameras is arranged in a horizontal row in the middle ground, positioned at eye level with the camera against a blurred background. The shot begins framed on the left side of the collection, with a tall black camera in the center of the view. The frame then pans horizontally to the right, revealing the full extent of the camera lineup, including a central camera with a large lens and several others to its right. After reaching the rightmost end of the collection, the pan reverses its direction, moving from right to left and returning to a view of the cameras on the left side of the arrangement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A collection of various 360-degree and panoramic cameras is displayed standing upright within the preview window of an editing software interface. The cameras are predominantly black and dark gray, with different shapes and sizes. One prominent black camera features a large, single lens with \"Leica\" branding on the silver ring around it. Another tall, rectangular black camera has \"KANDAO\" printed on its side, while a smaller, compact black camera is labeled \"ONE X2\" below its screen. A silver, rectangular camera is marked with the brand \"trisio\" in white letters. Also visible is a black camera with a textured grip and \"RICOH\" branding. Most of the cameras feature dual, opposing fisheye lenses, characteristic of 360-degree models. Surrounding the preview window are various editing panels in a gray and white design, indicating the use of editing software.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a video editing software interface with a dark theme displays a project titled \"My Vlog.\" The layout includes a media panel on the left, a timeline at the bottom, an inspector panel on the right, and a central preview window. Within the preview window, a video moves back and forth between the left and right across a collection of black and dark gray cameras arranged in a row indoors. The cameras, varying in size and shape, feature prominent circular lenses, and some have visible brand markings such as \"Leica\" and \"KANDAO.\" They are positioned on a surface against a neutral, out-of-focus background under even lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
