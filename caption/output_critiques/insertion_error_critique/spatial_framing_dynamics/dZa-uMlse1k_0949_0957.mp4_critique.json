    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the video starts underwater with a speargun held in the foreground, pointing down towards a seaweed-covered seabed that extends from the middle ground to the background. A gloved hand is visible at the bottom of the frame, and then both gloved hands are raised into the center foreground. The camera moves directly upward, breaking the water's surface. The scene transitions to an above-water view where a rocky, sandy shoreline occupies the background across the top of the frame, with the shallow sea in the middle ground. In the foreground, the tip of the speargun is positioned in the lower left, and a black fin is held in the right foreground, angled upwards. The camera remains at the subject's eye level throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a person is shown spearfishing, with their hands covered in blue and black patterned gloves that have a blue, textured honeycomb design on the palms. They are holding a black speargun, which has a black rubber band with a yellow tip and a thin metal spear with a barbed point. Both of the person's fins are visible and held together; they are black with the partially visible word \"YOUNGBL\" written in white vertical lettering. The scene transitions from an underwater view of a seabed covered in green seaweed to an above-water perspective of the clear, shallow sea and a rocky, sandy shoreline.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, captures a scene transitioning from underwater to the surface of the ocean. Initially, the view is submerged in clear, turquoise water, looking down at a seabed covered in green and brown seaweed, with a black spearfishing gun and blue patterned gloves visible. The perspective then breaks the surface on a sunny day, revealing a view of the shallow, sparkling water and a nearby shoreline. The coast consists of a sandy beach and a low, rocky hill with sparse vegetation under a clear blue sky. A black fin with white lettering is visible above the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
