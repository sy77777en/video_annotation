    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, framed entirely from a first-person perspective through the black, figure-eight outline of binoculars in the foreground. The scenery itself is composed of barren, rolling hills in the middle ground, which occupy the bottom two-thirds of the circular view, and a pale sky in the background, filling the top third. The camera, positioned at a high angle relative to the terrain, is initially unsteady and then begins a slow, continuous pan from left to right, scanning across the expansive landscape and causing different sections of the hills to move through the center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a landscape scenery shot, framed as a view through a pair of binoculars. The scene captures a vast expanse of barren, rolling hills or mountains under a pale, hazy sky. The terrain is a uniform light brown, suggesting a desert or arid environment with a rough, sandy texture. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is instead on the immense scale and desolate atmosphere of the environment. The binocular perspective implies an act of searching or observation, further highlighting the emptiness of the wide, open landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character’s eyes, scans a vast, arid landscape. The view is framed by the black, figure-eight outline of binoculars, an overlay complete with faint scratches on the lenses. Through the optics, rolling, barren hills of a light brown and tan color stretch across the horizon under a pale, hazy sky. The perspective is unsteady, panning slowly across the desolate, rocky terrain.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
