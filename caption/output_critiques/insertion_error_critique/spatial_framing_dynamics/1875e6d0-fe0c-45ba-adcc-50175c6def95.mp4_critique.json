    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of purple lavender flowers in the foreground, which occupy the bottom and central portions of the frame. A blurry woman stands in the center of the middle ground, with a hedge of red and green foliage in the background. The focus then racks from the foreground flowers to the woman, transitioning the shot into a medium shot. In the final composition, the woman is in focus in the center of the frame, with the now-blurry lavender remaining in the foreground at the bottom and the hedge in the background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up, out-of-focus view of tall purple lavender flowers on green stems. The focus then shifts to reveal a young woman standing behind the flowers. She has a light skin tone, long dark brown hair, and is wearing red lipstick. She is dressed in a dark green hooded sweatshirt that features a photographic graphic on the front. Her head is tilted back with her eyes closed.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor garden scene is viewed through stalks of purple lavender in the foreground. In the background, a dense hedge of green leaves is interspersed with bright red flowers. Positioned between the foreground flowers and the background hedge, a woman wearing a dark green hoodie stands with her head tilted back. The focus of the shot shifts from the lavender to the woman.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
