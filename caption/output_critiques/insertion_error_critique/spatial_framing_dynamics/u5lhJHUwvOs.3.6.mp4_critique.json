    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a person's lower legs and feet, which are positioned in the center-right foreground. A red line on the wooden floor extends from the bottom-left toward the center, and a textured wall occupies the background. The camera then tilts upward, reframing the scene into a medium close-up shot that shows the person from the waist up. In this final composition, the person is located in the center-right of the frame in the middle ground, with the camera positioned at their level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man of East Asian descent with short, bleached blonde hair stands on a court. He is wearing a dark navy blue long-sleeved shirt, black shorts, black socks, and black, white, and orange athletic shoes. A red abrasion is visible on the outer side of his lower right leg, just above the sock. He wears black-framed protective glasses and holds a blue and white patterned squash racket with a black handle in his right hand. His expression is neutral and focused.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on an indoor court featuring light-colored, textured walls and a light wood floor marked with a red line. A person wearing a dark long-sleeved shirt, black shorts, and black, white, and orange athletic shoes stands on the court, holding a squash racket with a blue and white patterned frame and a black handle. The camera begins with a high view of the person's legs and feet before tilting upward to reveal their torso and face.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
