    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic orbital scenery shot depicting a large-scale bombardment of Earth from space. The planet's curved horizon is visible against the blackness of space, with its surface covered in a dynamic layer of white clouds. Multiple bright, fiery explosions detonate across the globe, sending out massive, expanding shockwaves that push the clouds away in concentric circles. Thin, white trails, resembling missiles, streak through the upper atmosphere, converging on the planet's surface. The absence of a main subject serves to emphasize the overwhelming scale and catastrophic nature of the event, focusing the viewer's attention on the widespread environmental destruction rather than a specific object or character.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains subjective adjectives, which the instructions explicitly forbid. Specifically, the words \"dramatic,\" \"massive,\" \"overwhelming,\" and \"catastrophic\" convey emotion or interpretation rather than objective visual description. The final sentence, while correctly explaining the absence of a main subject as per the scenery shot rule, uses this subjective language. To improve the caption, remove \"dramatic\" from the first sentence and \"massive\" from the third sentence. Revise the final sentence to be more neutral, for example: \"The absence of a main subject emphasizes the large scale of the event, focusing attention on the environmental impact across the planet's surface rather than on a specific object or character.\"",
