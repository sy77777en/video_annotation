    "pre_caption": "In a stark white room, a man wearing a red top hat and a white jumpsuit with a red stripe stands on a small white platform with his hands on his hips. He is surrounded by several other people dressed in identical white jumpsuits with red stripes. One of these people, wearing a white helmet, stands in the center of the room, pointing a finger upwards. Another person stands nearby with arms slightly outstretched. To the left, another figure in a white helmet stands beside the platform, and a fourth person is partially visible behind a white structure. In the background, more figures in white are gathered around a white table. Floating above them all is a large, dense cloud of tiny, dark, and reddish-colored particles suspended against the white ceiling.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several inaccuracies regarding the number, location, and orientation of the people on the left side of the scene. It incorrectly states that \"several people\" are on the left side at a table, when only one person is visible at a console on the far left. It also inaccurately describes the figures next to the man in the hat, claiming \"two figures... stand on the platform... facing away from the camera.\" In the video, only one figure stands on the stairs next to him, holding a helmet and facing toward the center of the room. The description of the main subject's stance is overly wordy and can be simplified from \"stands with one foot on a small white platform and the other on the step of a small staircase\" to \"stands on a small white staircase.\" Finally, the particles are described as being \"suspended against the white wall,\" when they are clearly floating in the air above the subjects. The descriptions of the figures on the left should be corrected and combined for accuracy and clarity.",
