    "pre_caption": "This video captures an expansive aerial landscape scenery shot, revealing a breathtaking panorama of a tropical coastline. The view sweeps over the vibrant green canopy of a dense, rolling jungle that stretches down to meet the deep blue ocean. In the distance, the shoreline curves into a wide bay under a bright blue sky lightly scattered with fluffy white clouds. There is no single main subject in this shot. The focus is intentionally broad, capturing the immense scale and natural beauty of the entire environment. The composition emphasizes the relationship between the forest, the land, and the sea, creating an atmospheric and immersive experience rather than directing attention to a specific object or entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the video as a scenery shot and correctly describes the landscape elements. However, it violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" by using words like \"breathtaking,\" \"natural beauty,\" \"atmospheric,\" and \"immersive.\" Additionally, the final three sentences explaining the lack of a main subject are overly long and descriptive. This section should be condensed into one or two more objective sentences, simply stating that the focus is on the scale of the environment and the relationship between the forest and the sea, rather than a specific subject.",
