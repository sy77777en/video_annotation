    "pre_caption": "This nature scenery shot presents a high-angle, close-up view of a body of water. The surface is a deep, rich purple, textured with a dense pattern of small, diagonal ripples that catch a soft, warm light on their crests. There is no main subject in the video. The focus is entirely on the mesmerizing, almost abstract pattern and gentle movement of the water's surface, creating a tranquil and atmospheric scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" by using the words \"rich,\" \"mesmerizing,\" and \"tranquil.\" The final sentence is also slightly redundant. To correct this, remove the subjective adjectives and condense the last two sentences. The phrase \"creating a tranquil and atmospheric scene\" should be deleted.",
