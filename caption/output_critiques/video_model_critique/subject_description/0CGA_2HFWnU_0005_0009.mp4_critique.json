    "pre_caption": "This video presents an ascending cityscape scenery shot, revealing an urban landscape nestled within a natural environment. The camera begins at a lower elevation, focused on lush, green deciduous trees and a brick apartment building on a quiet street. As it rises, a dense city skyline of high-rise buildings and a construction crane comes into view, set against a dramatic backdrop of distant, rugged mountains under a partly cloudy blue sky. There is no main subject, as the camera's movement is designed to capture the expansive scale and atmosphere of the entire scene. The focus is on the relationship between the verdant residential foreground and the sprawling urban and natural landscape, creating a sense of place rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is overly long and contains information that could be more concise. The introductory phrase \"This video presents\" is unnecessary and should be removed. The description of the street as \"quiet\" is an inference rather than a visual observation and should be omitted. The adjective \"dramatic\" used to describe the mountain backdrop is subjective and should be removed to maintain objectivity. The final two sentences explaining the lack of a main subject are slightly redundant and can be combined into a single, more concise sentence. For example, the caption could be improved to: \"An ascending cityscape scenery shot reveals an urban landscape nestled within a natural environment. The view begins at a lower elevation, focused on lush, green deciduous trees and a brick apartment building. As it rises, a dense city skyline of high-rise buildings and a construction crane comes into view, set against a backdrop of distant, rugged mountains under a partly cloudy blue sky.
