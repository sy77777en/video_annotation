    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a massive, turbulent storm system moving over a flat, rural plain. The video's focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific object. The sky is almost entirely consumed by a colossal supercell cloud, which is dark grey and nearly black at its base, with lighter grey and white layers swirling above. Below this ominous formation, a vast expanse of green and brown farmland with visible crop rows stretches toward a line of low, distant hills silhouetted against a sliver of bright, warm light on the horizon, from which a curtain of rain appears to be falling.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions by using the words \"dramatic\" and \"ominous.\" These should be removed. The description of the scenery is otherwise accurate, correctly identifying the massive supercell cloud, its dark grey and black base with lighter layers, and the flat, rural plain with green and brown farmland. The detail about the distant hills silhouetted against a sliver of bright light and the curtain of falling rain is also correct. To improve conciseness and better adhere to the guidelines for scenery shots, the first two sentences should be combined into a single, more direct statement.",
