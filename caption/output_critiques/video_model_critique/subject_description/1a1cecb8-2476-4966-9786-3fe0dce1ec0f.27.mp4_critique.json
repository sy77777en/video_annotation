    "pre_caption": "This video presents an urban scenery shot from a street-level perspective, capturing a wide-angle view of a city intersection. There is no main subject because the camera pans across the environment, emphasizing the overall atmosphere of the location rather than a specific object or person. The focus is on the setting itself, which includes tree-lined streets, crosswalks, distant brick buildings, and traffic lights, creating a sense of place and movement through the urban landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a significant factual error by describing two individuals in detail—one with pink hair and a mask, and another with a light-colored shirt and jacket. These individuals are not visible in the video; the only people present are small, indistinct figures in the distant midground whose specific features cannot be discerned. This description violates the instruction to avoid describing what is not visible or uncertain. The caption should be corrected by removing the entire inaccurate description of the people. Instead, it should accurately describe the scene as a fast-panning, wide-angle scenery shot of a city intersection, mentioning the visible elements like tree-lined streets, crosswalks, traffic lights, distant buildings, and the cars that appear briefly on the left and right sides of the view.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video is a fast-panning, wide-angle shot of a city intersection, filmed from a street-level perspective. As the camera sweeps from left to right, it captures tree-lined streets, white-striped crosswalks, and traffic lights. A red car is briefly visible on the far left, and a silver car enters the frame from the right. In the background, large brick buildings and a few indistinct pedestrians on a distant sidewalk can be seen.",
