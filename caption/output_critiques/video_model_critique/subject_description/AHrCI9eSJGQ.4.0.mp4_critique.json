    "pre_caption": "This is a seascape scenery shot filmed from the bow of a massive container ship. The focus is not on a single object but on the expansive environment and the atmosphere of a sea voyage. The composition emphasizes the scale of the ship against the vastness of the ocean and sky. Stacks of red, blue, and orange shipping containers fill the foreground, leading the eye towards the open, calm, greenish-blue sea under a vast, pale blue sky with wispy, streaked clouds, while a few other ships are visible as small silhouettes on the hazy horizon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but can be improved for conciseness and detail. The sentences \"The focus is not on a single object but on the expansive environment and the atmosphere of a sea voyage\" and \"The composition emphasizes the scale of the ship against the vastness of the ocean and sky\" are redundant and should be combined to improve conciseness. Additionally, the description of other vessels is incomplete; while it mentions \"ships... on the hazy horizon,\" it omits a smaller boat creating a wake in the midground to the right. The description should be updated to include this boat and distinguish it from the distant ship on the horizon.",
