    "pre_caption": "This is a moody cityscape scenery shot viewed from the interior of a car on a rainy night. The scene is bathed in a deep, cinematic blue light, with streaks of red reflecting off wet surfaces outside. Through the rain-streaked windshield, the outside world is blurred and obscured, revealing only the faint outline of a structure containing what appears to be an illuminated payphone or ATM on the left. There is no main subject, as the focus is on establishing a somber and mysterious atmosphere. The obscured view, the dark, color-saturated lighting, and the rain work together to create a sense of isolation and suspense within the urban environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains subjective and interpretive language, which the instructions explicitly forbid. Words like \"moody,\" \"cinematic,\" \"somber,\" \"mysterious,\" and phrases like \"create a sense of isolation and suspense\" describe emotions and atmosphere rather than objective visual facts. The caption also speculates that the red light comes from a \"doorway,\" which is not certain. The final two sentences are redundant and overly interpretive, explaining the atmospheric effect instead of just describing the scene. To fix this, remove all subjective adjectives and interpretive phrases. Rephrase the description of the red light to be more factual. Delete the last two sentences entirely to make the description concise and focused on observable details.",
