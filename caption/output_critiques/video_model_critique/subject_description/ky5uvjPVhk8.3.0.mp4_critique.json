    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot featuring a tranquil garden path bordered by lush greenery and vibrant autumn foliage, with a traditional wooden building displaying clean architectural lines and natural materials. The focus is on the harmonious blend of nature and architecture, highlighting the serene atmosphere and the scale of the environment rather than any individual subject. There is no main subject because the intent is to immerse the viewer in the peaceful ambiance and visual balance of the garden and its surroundings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits a key element visible in the video: there are people present, specifically a woman in a black and white kimono walking with a stroller and a child, as well as another person further down the path. The caption should mention these human subjects, describing their appearance and actions briefly, as they are salient and identifiable. The rest of the caption accurately describes the garden, foliage, and traditional wooden building, but it should be revised to include the people and their visual attributes to fully meet the instruction requirements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a tranquil garden path bordered by lush greenery and vibrant autumn foliage, with a traditional wooden building displaying clean architectural lines and natural materials. Along the path, a woman in a black and white kimono is seen walking with a stroller and a child, adding a human element to the serene scene. Another person is visible further down the path, contributing to the sense of scale and life within the environment. The focus remains on the harmonious blend of nature and architecture, highlighting the peaceful ambiance and visual balance of the garden and its surroundings, while also acknowledging the presence of people enjoying the space.",
