    "pre_caption": "The video features two stylized, human-like figures rendered in a gray, low-polygon style, giving them a faceted, geometric appearance. Initially, the focus is on the back of one figure seated in a chair in the foreground. As the video progresses, the focus shifts to the other figure, who is seated opposite, facing forward with their hands in their lap. This second figure comes into clear view while the foreground figure blurs and moves out of the frame. Both figures are depicted in a similar static, seated pose.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video opens with a medium shot of a figure in what appears to be a quiz show. As the camera lifts upward and moves forward, the foreground figure gradually falls out of focus and exits the frame, while the person opposite comes into focus in a full shot.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits a key visual element: the prominent graphical overlay at the bottom of the screen. This overlay, which features a question and four blank, lettered answer boxes (A, B, C, D) in a style characteristic of a quiz show, is a salient subject that provides crucial context to the scene. Additionally, the statement that the foreground figure \"moves out of the frame\" is slightly inaccurate. A more precise description would be that the figure becomes blurry and is partially cropped by the bottom of the frame as the focus shifts. The caption should be revised to include a description of the text overlay and to more accurately describe the movement of the foreground figure.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a stylized, dimly lit setting, the video shows two human-like figures rendered in a gray, low-polygon style. A prominent graphical overlay at the bottom of the screen, resembling a quiz show interface, presents a question: \"Which American platform was founded in 2012 and is known for its creative and interactive online lessons?\". Beneath the question are four blank, lettered answer boxes (A, B, C, D). The initial focus is on the back of a seated figure in the foreground. The focus then shifts to a second figure seated opposite, who comes into clear view facing forward with hands in their lap. As the focus changes, the foreground figure becomes blurry and is partially cropped by the bottom of the frame.",
