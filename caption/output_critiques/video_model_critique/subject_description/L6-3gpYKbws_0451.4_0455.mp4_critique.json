    "pre_caption": "This video captures a coastal and underwater scenery shot, showcasing a tropical paradise. The sequence begins at the water's surface, looking towards a sandy beach lined with palm trees and colorful buildings with red roofs, all nestled at the foot of a lush, green hill under a vibrant blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The perspective then dips below the gentle ripples, transitioning into a serene underwater view where the water is a clear turquoise, illuminating a sandy seabed and a large school of small, silvery fish swimming together. The video lacks a main subject, as its purpose is to immerse the viewer in the environment and convey the peaceful, scenic atmosphere of the location, both above and below the water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains subjective and emotional adjectives such as \"tropical paradise,\" \"serene,\" \"peaceful,\" and \"scenic,\" which should be removed to maintain objectivity. It also omits a visible subject: the top of a snorkeler's head is present in the foreground on the left at the beginning of the video and should be mentioned. Finally, the last sentence, which explains why the video is a scenery shot, is overly interpretive and verbose. It should be condensed to a more direct statement, such as \"The video is a scenery shot, as the focus is on the environment both above and below the water rather than on a specific subject.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a coastal and underwater scenery shot. The sequence begins from a water-level perspective, with the top of a snorkeler's head visible in the foreground on the left. The view looks towards a sandy beach lined with palm trees and buildings with red roofs, situated at the base of a green hill under a blue sky with white clouds. The camera then dips below the water's surface, transitioning to an underwater view. The water is clear and turquoise, revealing a sandy seabed where a large school of small, silvery fish swims together. The video is a scenery shot, as the focus is on the environment both above and below the water rather than on a specific subject.",
