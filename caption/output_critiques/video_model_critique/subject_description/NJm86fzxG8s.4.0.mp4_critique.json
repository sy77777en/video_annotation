    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a vast, desolate, and snow-covered mountain range under a gray, overcast sky. A heavy fog or mist blankets the scene, obscuring the distance, while soft snowflakes drift down through the air. The focus of the shot is on the immense scale and cold, solitary atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific subject. This is emphasized by a single, small, stylized figure sitting atop a snowy peak, emitting a warm, golden glow that contrasts with the cold, muted tones of the surrounding landscape and illuminates a faint path leading up the slope.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a significant factual error by misidentifying the central subject. The object on the snowy summit is not a \"small house with a gabled roof,\" \"brick-red walls,\" and a \"chimney.\" It is a small, stylized figure wearing a red, triangular cloak, which is the source of a bright, golden light. The description should be corrected to accurately portray this figure. Additionally, the caption uses subjective adjectives like \"desolate,\" \"cold,\" and \"solitary,\" which should be removed as per the instructions. The sentence \"The focus of the shot is on the immense scale and cold, solitary atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific subject\" is both subjective and inaccurate, as the glowing figure is the clear focal point of the scene; this sentence should be deleted. The revised caption should focus on an objective description of the snowy, foggy mountain landscape with the small, red-cloaked, glowing figure at its peak.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a landscape view of a snow-covered mountain range under a gray, overcast sky. A thick fog obscures much of the environment, and snow is falling. The central focus is a small, stylized figure wearing a red, triangular cloak, seated on a snowy summit. A bright, golden light emanates from the figure, illuminating the peak and a faint path on the mountainside below.",
