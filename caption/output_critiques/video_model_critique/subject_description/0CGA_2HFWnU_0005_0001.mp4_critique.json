    "pre_caption": "This video presents an urban park scenery shot, descending to reveal a wide view of an empty gravel soccer field. The field, featuring a single white goal, is set against a backdrop of a three-story, brown-brick apartment building and a street with parked cars, all seen through a chain-link fence. Large, leafy green trees frame the scene on both sides, with distant mountains visible under a partly cloudy blue sky. There is no main subject, as the camera's movement serves to establish the quiet, sunlit environment and capture the overall atmosphere of the location rather than focusing on a specific person or object. The composition emphasizes the sense of place, blending natural and urban elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a factual error and includes overly interpretive and subjective language that should be removed. The statement \"Several people can be seen moving along the street\" is inaccurate, as there are no people visible on the street in the video. Additionally, the final sentence, \"The camera's movement serves to establish the quiet, sunlit environment and capture the overall atmosphere of the location, emphasizing the sense of place by blending natural and urban elements,\" is too long and interpretive. It violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives like \"quiet\" and to focus on describing visual facts rather than the director's intent or the scene's atmosphere. This sentence should be deleted entirely.",
