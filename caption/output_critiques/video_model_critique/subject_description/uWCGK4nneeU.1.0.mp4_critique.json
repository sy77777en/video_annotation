    "pre_caption": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot, framed as a view through a pair of binoculars. The scene captures a vast expanse of barren, rolling hills or mountains under a pale, hazy sky. The terrain is a uniform light brown, suggesting a desert or arid environment with a rough, sandy texture. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is instead on the immense scale and desolate atmosphere of the environment. The binocular perspective implies an act of searching or observation, further highlighting the emptiness of the wide, open landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

Additionally, the description includes subjective and interpretive language that violates the guidelines. The phrases \"desolate atmosphere,\" \"implies an act of searching or observation,\" and \"highlighting the emptiness\" should be removed, as the instructions explicitly state to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" and to \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The description should focus only on the objective visual information.",
