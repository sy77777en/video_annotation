The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of scale and mystery in the vast, quiet deep. Dim light filters down from above, illuminating the conning tower with its various periscopes and masts, while small, bright particles drift slowly through the hazy water, enhancing the deep-sea ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly classifies the video as a scenery shot without a salient subject, when the submarine is clearly the main subject. The description should be rewritten to focus on the submarine as the primary subject, as per the instructions. The sentence \"The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of scale and mystery in the vast, quiet deep\" is inaccurate and should be removed. Additionally, the phrase \"enhancing the deep-sea ambiance\" is subjective and should be omitted. The description should begin directly with the subject and provide more detail about its visible features.\n\nHere is a revised version:\n\nA large, gray submarine is submerged in murky, turquoise-blue water. The view is from above and to the side, showing the flat top of the vessel's conning tower, which features a cluster of vertical, cylindrical structures of varying heights, such as periscopes and masts. Light filters down from the surface, and small, bright particles drift through the water around the submarine.",
