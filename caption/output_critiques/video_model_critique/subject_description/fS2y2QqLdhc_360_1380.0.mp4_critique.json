    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot at night, capturing a spectacular electrical display from a massive, tower-like structure. The dark, cylindrical tower is topped with a large, flat ring from which vibrant, purple arcs of electricity, resembling bolts of lightning, erupt and dance against the dark sky. In the background, the warm glow of streetlights and the illuminated windows of a distant building punctuate the darkness, with the silhouettes of trees and a crowd of onlookers framing the scene. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the public spectacle. The combination of the powerful electrical discharge and the urban setting creates a dynamic environmental scene rather than focusing on a specific entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly classifies the video as a scenery shot with no main subject. The tower creating the electrical display is a clear and salient subject that should be the primary focus of the description. The final two sentences, which argue that there is no main subject and that the focus is on the overall atmosphere, are factually incorrect based on the visual evidence and should be deleted. The description should be restructured to begin with the main subject—the tower—and its actions. The descriptions of the crowd and background elements are accurate but should be presented more concisely as secondary elements that provide context for the main spectacle.",
