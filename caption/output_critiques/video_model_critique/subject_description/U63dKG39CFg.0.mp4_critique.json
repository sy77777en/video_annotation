There is no main subject because the focus is on the vastness and emptiness of the environment, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the natural and semi-abandoned landscape rather than any specific object or individual. The visual narrative centers on the mood and character of the setting itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate and follows the instruction well by focusing on the landscape and noting the absence of a main subject, but it could be improved by including more specific visual details visible in the video. The video shows a barren, sandy shoreline with scattered rocks, weathered wooden posts, and remnants of structures in the foreground, leading to a calm blue body of water, with distant mountains under a clear sky. The mention of \"arid plain dotted with sparse, weathered structures\" is appropriate, but the caption should specify the presence of wooden posts, rock piles, and low, crumbling walls, as these are visually prominent. The phrase \"semi-abandoned landscape\" is accurate, but the caption should avoid subjective terms like \"mood and character\" and instead focus on the physical features. The transition between shoreline and plain is clear, but the caption should clarify that the video pans from the shoreline to the inland area with more structural remnants. Remove the phrase \"visual narrative centers on the mood and character of the setting itself\" as it is subjective and not required. Overall, add more concrete details about the visible objects and structures, and keep the language objective and descriptive.",
