    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot that immerses the viewer in a cold, arctic environment. The video begins at the water's surface, capturing dark, undulating waves against a backdrop of majestic, snow-covered mountains under a clear, deep blue twilight sky. The perspective then dips below the surface, plunging into the dark, deep teal-colored water where small bubbles float and the surface is visible from beneath as a shimmering, blurry line of light. There is no main subject, as the focus is on creating an atmospheric experience and highlighting the dramatic contrast between the crisp, expansive world above the water and the dark, mysterious realm beneath it. The shot emphasizes the vastness and raw beauty of the natural environment itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the video as a scenery shot and correctly describes the transition from above to below the water's surface. However, it violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives and interpretive language. The caption uses words like \"majestic,\" \"dramatic,\" \"crisp,\" \"expansive,\" \"mysterious,\" \"vastness,\" and \"raw beauty,\" all of which are subjective. Phrases such as \"immerses the viewer\" and \"creating an atmospheric experience\" describe the effect on the audience rather than the visual content. The explanation for why there is no main subject is overly long and interpretive. Additionally, the phrase \"The video begins\" is a temporal reference that should be avoided, and describing the setting as a \"cold, arctic environment\" is an unconfirmed assumption. The caption should be revised to remove all subjective, interpretive, and speculative language, and the explanation for the lack of a subject should be made more concise and factual.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A low-angle, water-level shot shows dark, moving water with a range of snow-covered mountains in the background under a clear sky. The camera then dips below the surface, transitioning to an underwater view. From below, the water appears dark teal with small bubbles, and the water's surface is seen as a blurred line of light. There is no main subject; the shot focuses on the natural scenery, showing the environment from both above and below the water line.",
