    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static architectural scenery shot of a large, two-story brick house. There is no main subject, as the camera's fixed perspective is intended to capture the overall environment and architectural style of the residence rather than a specific person or object. The house features a red brick facade, a dark gabled roof, and a section of white stucco with dark half-timbering, characteristic of a Tudor revival style. A prominent chimney rises from the roofline, and an arched wooden door marks the entrance. The property is enclosed by a black metal fence, behind which lies a green lawn and various plants, including a distinctive, multi-trunked yucca tree in the foreground and the top of a palm tree visible in the background. The scene is set under a bright, overcast sky, creating a neutral and observational atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly places the palm tree in the \"middleground\" when it is visible in the background behind the house. The phrase \"creating a neutral and observational atmosphere\" is subjective and should be removed. The explanation for why there is no main subject (\"as the camera's perspective is intended to capture...\") is overly interpretive and should be deleted. The caption also omits the prominent, bare, leafless tree on the left side of the scene. Finally, the description of the entrance as an \"arched wooden door\" is an assumption; only the arched entryway is clearly visible, not the material or specific design of the door itself.",
