The view spirals upwards, framed by the repeating geometry of dark, ornate wrought-iron railings and white support columns set against warm, orange-toned walls. There is no main subject because the focus is on conveying the scale and atmosphere of the interior space. The shot's purpose is to highlight the architectural design and create a sense of immense height, rather than to center on a specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

The final two sentences, \"There is no main subject because the focus is on conveying the scale and atmosphere of the interior space\" and \"The shot's purpose is to highlight the architectural design and create a sense of immense height, rather than to center on a specific person or object,\" state the same idea and should be combined into a single, more concise sentence. Additionally, the description of \"dark brown support columns\" is inaccurate; the dark brown elements are the wooden handrails that top the railings. The caption should be revised to replace \"dark brown support columns\" with \"dark brown wooden handrails\" and to merge the final two sentences for conciseness.",
