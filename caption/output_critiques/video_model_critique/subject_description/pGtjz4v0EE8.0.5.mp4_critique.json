    "pre_caption": "This video captures a bright and sunny cityscape scenery shot along a canal in Venice, Italy. The view pans across a row of historic, multi-story buildings painted in warm shades of yellow and orange, featuring terracotta tile roofs, numerous windows, and balconies. The greenish water of the canal is dotted with traditional black gondolas and a larger white and red water bus carrying passengers, all navigating between wooden mooring poles. The shot does not have a single main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall environment and bustling atmosphere of the iconic city. The composition is designed to convey a sense of place and scale, highlighting the unique relationship between the architecture and the waterway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains two factual errors: the water bus is white and red, not \"yellow and black,\" and the video does not feature a \"yellow speedboat and a white speedboat,\" so this detail should be removed. Additionally, the final two sentences, which explain that the shot lacks a main subject and is designed to convey a sense of place, are redundant and should be deleted as this is already implied by the description of the scenery. The phrases \"bustling atmosphere\" and \"iconic city\" are also subjective and should be removed to maintain objectivity.",
