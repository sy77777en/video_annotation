    "pre_caption": "A massive, grey wind turbine blade hangs vertically, suspended by thick cables attached to its wider, upper root section. The blade tapers to a sharp point at the bottom and features bold black lettering along its side. Two workers are positioned on the suspended structure. The first worker, wearing a white safety helmet and dark protective clothing, stands at the very top edge near the rigging attachment points. The second worker, also dressed in dark industrial gear and a helmet, is situated midway down the blade, standing securely within a recessed access hatch cut into the smooth, composite surface of the equipment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

It is suspended in mid-air by several steel cables. There are no black markings on the side of the airplane. On the upper end of the wreckage, two figures who appear to be special forces soldiers are climbing along the edge; they are wearing gray helmets instead of white ones and dressed in dark work uniforms.

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate and follows the instruction well by clearly identifying the main subject (a large, grey airplane wreckage suspended vertically by steel cables) and describing the four individuals with specific visual attributes (gray helmets, dark work uniforms, climbing or positioned on the wreckage). However, the phrase \"resembling special forces soldiers\" is speculative and should be avoided, as the instruction requires only describing what is visible and not making assumptions about roles or professions. Additionally, the mention that the wreckage \"lacks any black markings on its side\" is unnecessary unless it is important for distinguishing the wreckage, which is not specified in the instruction. The rest of the caption is concise, clear, and coherent, with appropriate detail about the subjects' positions and attire. To improve, remove the speculative language and the unnecessary note about black markings: \"A large, grey airplane wreckage hangs vertically, suspended by several steel cables, with its nose directed downward. At the upper end, two individuals wearing gray helmets and dark work uniforms are climbing along the edge. Two other individuals in similar attire are positioned on the middle section of the wreckage, with one near an airplane window.\"",
