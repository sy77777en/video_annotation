    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a vast, open plain under an immense and ominous storm system. The sky is dominated by a heavy, dark blanket of turbulent clouds, ranging from deep charcoal grey at the top to lighter, churning formations below, with a curtain of distant rain obscuring the horizon. The flat, arid ground, covered in sparse, brownish vegetation, stretches across the bottom of the frame, accentuating the sheer scale of the weather above. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the powerful, foreboding atmosphere and the dramatic interplay between the dark sky and the wide-open land.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is well-written and accurately follows the instructions for describing a scenery shot. However, it uses several subjective adjectives that the instructions advise against. The words \"ominous,\" \"powerful,\" and \"foreboding\" convey emotion and interpretation rather than sticking to purely visual description. To improve, replace \"ominous storm system\" with \"dark storm system.\" Additionally, rephrase the final sentence to be more objective; for instance, instead of \"the powerful, foreboding atmosphere and the dramatic interplay,\" use \"the dramatic atmosphere and the visual contrast.\"",
