    "pre_caption": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot from a low-angle perspective, looking up at a massive, dark pile of glittering, granular tailings. The mound fills the foreground, its surface sparkling under direct sunlight, creating a stark contrast against the towering, sandy-brown canyon walls in the background. There is no single main subject, as the composition is designed to convey a sense of immense scale and the overwhelming presence of the industrial waste within the natural environment. The focus is on the atmosphere and the relationship between the man-made and the natural rather than a specific, discrete object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is accurate but could be more concise. The introductory phrase \"This video presents\" is unnecessary and can be removed to make the description more direct. Additionally, the final two sentences, \"There is no single main subject, as the composition is designed to convey a sense of immense scale and the overwhelming presence of the industrial waste within the natural environment. The focus is on the atmosphere and the relationship between the man-made and the natural rather than a specific, discrete object,\" are slightly redundant. These should be combined into a single, more direct sentence that explains the lack of a main subject by stating that the focus is on the immense scale of the industrial waste within the natural landscape.",
