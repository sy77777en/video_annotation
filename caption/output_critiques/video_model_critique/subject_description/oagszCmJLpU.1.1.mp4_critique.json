    "pre_caption": "This video presents a time-lapse landscape scenery shot of a vast, golden prairie under a deep blue sky. A massive, billowing white cumulonimbus cloud with a dark, flat base dominates the frame, indicating an approaching storm. There is no main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale of the natural environment and the dramatic atmospheric conditions over a specific focal point. The focus is on the powerful interplay between the expansive, flat earth and the dynamic, towering cloud formation above it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the scene as a time-lapse landscape and accurately describes the prairie and the cumulonimbus cloud. However, it can be improved by removing the introductory phrase \"This video presents\" and the forbidden word \"frame\" to adhere to the instructions. The subjective adjectives \"dramatic\" and \"powerful\" should also be removed. Additionally, the final two sentences, which both explain the lack of a main subject, are slightly redundant and could be combined for better conciseness.",
