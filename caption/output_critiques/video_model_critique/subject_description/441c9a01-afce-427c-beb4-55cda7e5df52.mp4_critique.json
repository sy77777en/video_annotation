    "pre_caption": "This video features a sky scenery shot, capturing a worm's-eye view of a bright blue sky populated with a dense pattern of small, white, puffy clouds. The scene is framed by the edges of what appears to be a large, open skylight or the top of a building, which has a gray, block-like texture. There is no main subject in this shot; instead, the focus is on the expansive and textured atmosphere of the cloud-filled sky, creating a sense of openness and scale.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

However, the final phrase, \"creating a sense of openness and scale,\" describes the interpretive effect of the shot rather than its direct visual attributes. To adhere more strictly to the instruction to avoid subjective descriptions and focus only on visual details, this phrase should be removed.",
