  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the scene and the general motion. However, the phrase \"as if someone is scanning the horizon\" is speculative, which violates the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements.\" This phrase should be removed to make the description more objective and focused purely on the observable motion. A more direct description, such as \"The viewpoint pans slowly from left to right across the terrain,\" would be more compliant with the guidelines.",
