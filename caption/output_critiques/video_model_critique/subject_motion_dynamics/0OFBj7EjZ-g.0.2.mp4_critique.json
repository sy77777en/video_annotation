Additionally, the description of the scene elements is overly detailed, using phrases like \"abstract, low-polygon trees\" and \"detailed model of two large, modern buildings with glass roofs, which are set within a simplified, all-white city model.\" This level of detail detracts from the primary focus on motion. The description should be condensed to focus more on the camera's movement relative to the objects, rather than the specific appearance of the objects themselves.",
