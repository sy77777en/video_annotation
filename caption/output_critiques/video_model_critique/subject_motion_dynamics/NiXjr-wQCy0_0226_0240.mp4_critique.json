    "pre_caption": "A woman lying on the ground repeatedly brings her fist down, smashing a stack of toaster pastries and sending crumbs flying. The video then plays in reverse, causing the broken pieces of a pastry to reassemble on the stack. The newly formed pastry then lifts off the stack and flies upward toward her raised fist.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A young, light-skinned woman with long, wavy brown hair lies on her stomach, smiling as she looks down. She is wearing a bright pink top, and a light blue scrunchie is visible on her left wrist. In front of her is a stack of rectangular toaster pastries with light-colored frosting and sprinkles. Throughout the video, she repeatedly uses her right hand to bring her fist down, smashing the pastries, which break into smaller pieces and crumbs on the dark surface. At one point, a whole pastry is tossed into the air.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is factually incorrect and omits the main action. First, the video does not begin with the woman smiling; it begins with her fist smashing a toaster pastry. The primary motion throughout the video is the woman repeatedly smashing the pastry with her fist in slow motion, an action that is completely missing from the description. Second, the caption incorrectly states \"The scene plays in reverse.\" In reality, only the final shot of the video is reversed, showing an intact pastry flying up into her hand, while the preceding smashing actions are shown playing forward. Finally, the reversed shot does not show a pastry \"reassembling from crumbs\"; it shows an already whole pastry flying upward.",
