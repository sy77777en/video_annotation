    "pre_caption": "A man in a yellow and black wetsuit ascends vertically through the water, pulling himself up along a white rope. He is accompanied by several other divers who ascend alongside him. As he nears the top, he continues his upward movement until he breaks the surface of the water, at which point he removes his nose clip and makes a hand gesture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video focuses on a man underwater wearing a form-fitting, long-sleeved, yellow wetsuit with black panels on the sides and a matching yellow hood. He has a nose clip on and a black watch on his left wrist. He is ascending vertically along a white rope. He is accompanied by several other divers. Two of these divers, acting as safety personnel, are men wearing white t-shirts with a circular logo over their dark wetsuits and diving masks. Another diver in a full black wetsuit with a white belt and fins is also present. As the man in the yellow suit nears and breaks the surface, a crowd of people becomes visible, some treading water and others on a white floating platform.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a factual error and an inaccurate description of the subject's motion. The video shows the man's left wrist, not his right, is connected to the rope. Additionally, he is not \"swimming vertically\"; he is actively pulling himself up the rope with his hands. The description of the other divers is accurate. The final action could be more specific.\n\nTo improve the caption, it should be revised to: \"A man in a yellow and black wetsuit ascends by pulling himself hand over hand up a white rope. His left wrist is connected to the rope by a yellow lanyard. He is accompanied by several other divers who ascend alongside him. He continues pulling himself upward until he breaks the surface of the water and raises his left hand.\"",
