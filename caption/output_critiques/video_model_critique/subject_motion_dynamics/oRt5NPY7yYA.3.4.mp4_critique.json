The other individuals in the foreground and background remain still throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows several people inside and at the rear of a long, narrow space, likely a truck trailer. In the foreground, a person with dark, short-to-medium length hair is seen from the back, wearing a light blue collared shirt. Next to them on the right is a person with short dark hair and glasses, wearing a light-colored t-shirt with a black glasses strap hanging behind their neck, also seen from the back. A man with short, light brown hair in a blue and white plaid shirt then appears on the left, touching and gesturing against the back of the trailer. A Black man in a dark blue shirt also briefly enters the frame on the far right. In the background, at the far end of the trailer, a group of several people are standing. Their features are not clear due to the distance and lighting, but one person wears a dark blue t-shirt and light-colored pants, while another is in a light-colored shirt.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately states that the man in the plaid shirt enters the frame \"due to camera movements.\" The video shows him actively walking into the frame from the left, not just being revealed by the camera's pan. The description of the person exiting the foreground is vague; it should specify it is the person in the light blue shirt to distinguish them from the other person in the foreground. Finally, the chronological flow could be improved by describing the simultaneous actions of the person in the blue shirt exiting and the man in the plaid shirt entering the frame.",
