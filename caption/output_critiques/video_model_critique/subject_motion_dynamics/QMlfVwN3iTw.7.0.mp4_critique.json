  "generated_critique": "The caption describes camera motion (\"The camera zooms out\") instead of the motion of subjects within the video, which goes against the instructions. It also includes subjective adjectives like \"scenic\" and \"unique-looking,\" which are explicitly forbidden. The video is a static scenery shot with no moving subjects. The caption should be revised to briefly state that the scene is static, removing the description of camera movement and the subjective language. A more appropriate description would be: \"This is a static shot of a row of modern, multi-story houses on a canal, with several small boats moored in the water in front of them.\"",
