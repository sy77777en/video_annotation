    "pre_caption": "A man stands on a set of train tracks in a tunnel, then turns slightly to his left, sweeping his flashlight beam across graffiti on the wall. He then turns forward and begins walking along the tracks. As he proceeds down the tunnel, he continuously moves the flashlight beam from side to side, illuminating the walls.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with ear-length, dark brown hair is seen from behind, walking along a set of train tracks in a dark, graffiti-covered tunnel. He wears a brown, textured jacket and has a brown leather satchel slung over his shoulder. Throughout the video, he holds a flashlight in his left hand, casting a bright, circular beam of light ahead of him. In his right hand, he holds a black pistol. At the beginning of the video, three dark, blurry, human-shaped silhouettes are visible deep in the railway tracks, appearing and disappearing as the camera perspective changes.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a significant chronological error. After the man looks into the adjacent tunnel, the caption states he \"walks back along the railway tracks in the direction from which he initially came.\" However, the video shows that he first continues walking forward down the original tunnel for several seconds before turning around and walking back. Additionally, the description of his initial movement as \"turning left and taking two steps before continuing forward and to the right\" is inaccurate; he walks mostly straight forward while turning his upper body to shine the light. The caption also omits the initial action of the man turning on his flashlight.",
