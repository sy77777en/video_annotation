    "pre_caption": "In a screen recording of video editing software, a cursor moves to the top of the main viewer and clicks a dropdown menu. From the revealed list of zoom percentages, the cursor selects \"200%\". The video clip in the viewer then zooms in, magnifying the image until it becomes a dark, grainy texture, over which the cursor then moves.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video is a screen recording of the Final Cut Pro video editing software. The interface shows a video clip in the main viewer, a timeline located at both the lower center and the lower left of the frame, and an inspector panel on the right with various settings and effects. The video clip being edited features three young adults with light skin in a dark environment, illuminated by small lanterns. A woman wearing a dark beanie and a red hooded sweatshirt with \"STANFORD\" in white letters across the chest is positioned slightly to the right of the frame's center, with her mouth open in an excited expression. On the left side of the frame is a man with short, dark hair smiling at the camera. On the right side of the frame, a third person wearing glasses is partially obscured by shadow. They are gathered around a table covered with a blue and white patterned cloth, on which sit two small, glowing lanterns, a clear glass jar, and what appear to be playing cards. During the recording, the user zooms into the video clip to 200%, causing the image to become a dark, grainy texture.**",
