It includes excessive detail about the house's architecture and landscaping (\"Tudor-revival architectural elements,\" \"black metal fence,\" \"landscaped with a green lawn, shrubs, and several trees\"). The description of the motion (\"The camera zooms in...\") is correct but is buried at the end of a long paragraph. The caption should be revised to be more concise, briefly setting the scene before describing the camera's zoom, which is the only movement in the video.",
