  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the static elements of the scene but completely omits the only motion present in the video. The instructions require a focus on the subject's motion. The caption should be revised to describe the slow, steady zoom-out of the camera, which gradually reveals more of the architectural model's exterior structure. Additionally, the phrase \"appear to be\" is speculative and should be removed to comply with the instructions.",

The model is dimly lit, with spotlights illuminating several interior auditoriums and assembly halls, each with a unique seating arrangement. As the shot widens, the stark, grey, modern exterior of the building is progressively revealed.",
