  "generated_critique": "The caption includes the speculative phrase \"likely representing the Berlin Wall,\" which violates the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements.\" The description of the camera's movement as \"pans along\" is also imprecise; the camera moves forward while simultaneously panning to the right. The caption should be revised to more accurately describe the camera's motion and remove the interpretive statement about the location.",
