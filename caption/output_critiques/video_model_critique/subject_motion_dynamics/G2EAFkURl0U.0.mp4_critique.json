  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the camera's motion but includes several subjective and emotional adjectives such as \"scenic,\" \"well-wooded,\" \"lush,\" and \"peaceful,\" which violate the instructions. The phrase \"creating a peaceful, natural setting\" is an interpretation rather than a direct observation. The description should be revised to be more objective, focusing strictly on the camera's movement and the visible elements. For example, the caption could be rewritten as: \"The camera pans slowly from left to right across an RV park, revealing numerous recreational vehicles and motorhomes parked among trees on paved roads.\"",
