    "pre_caption": "Several figures in dark robes stand and move within a circular area, while others lie motionless on the ground. Some of the standing figures walk or shift positions around the circle, and a few appear to approach or look toward the fallen individuals. The overall movement is slow and deliberate, with most activity concentrated among the standing figures, while those on the ground remain still throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately describes the motion as \"intense and panicked\" and states that figures are \"frequently falling.\" The video shows a mostly static scene where the standing figures are largely motionless. The only significant movement is the slow, deliberate collapse of two separate individuals to the ground. To improve accuracy, the description should be revised to state that most figures are stationary, and then chronologically note that two of the standing figures collapse to the floor.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dark, circular chamber under a cone of blue light, several figures in black robes lie motionless on a raised platform, while others stand. The scene is largely static. At the beginning of the clip, a figure in the foreground slowly collapses. Shortly after, another standing figure within the circle also crumples to the floor. The remaining standing figures are mostly still, and those on the ground do not move.",
