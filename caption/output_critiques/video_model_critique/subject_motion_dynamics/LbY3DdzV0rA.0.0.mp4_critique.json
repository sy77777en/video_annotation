  "generated_critique": "The caption fails to describe the motion present in the video, which is a core requirement of the instructions. Instead of describing the movement of the dust storm, it treats the video as a static scenery shot and focuses on describing the visual composition (\"The scene is split between...\"). The video clearly shows a massive wall of dust and the clouds above it moving across the frame. The caption also includes the subjective adjective \"dramatic\" and describes static elements like \"cacti and sparse vegetation,\" which violates the instructions to focus on motion and avoid subjective language. The caption should be rewritten to describe the advance of the dust storm across the desert landscape.",
