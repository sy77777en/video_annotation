    "pre_caption": "A man in black robes, wielding a double-bladed red lightsaber, spins his weapon before a man with a green lightsaber steps forward to engage him. A second man in off-white robes, wielding a blue lightsaber, quickly joins the fight, clashing his weapon against the man in black's. The man in black defends against both opponents simultaneously, spinning his double-bladed weapon to parry strikes coming from his left and right. The three men move rapidly around each other, their lightsabers clashing in a flurry of strikes and parries that produce bright flashes of light.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a brightly lit, futuristic setting, three men are engaged in a lightsaber duel. One man, with red and black facial tattoos and small horns on his head, is dressed in black robes and wields a double-bladed red lightsaber. He is fighting two other men. The first of his opponents is a man with long brown hair and a beard, wearing off-white robes with a dark belt, who wields a green lightsaber. The second opponent is a younger man with shorter brown hair and a small braid on one side, also dressed in off-white robes with a dark belt, who uses a blue lightsaber.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains two factual errors and a point of confusion. First, it states the man in black \"advances deeper into the frame,\" when he is actually retreating or moving backward as his two opponents move toward him. Second, it incorrectly claims \"one of the long-haired men is struck and moves toward the right side of the frame.\" In the video, the man who moves to the right has shorter hair and wields a blue lightsaber; he is dodging an attack, not being struck. This also makes the reference to \"long-haired men\" (plural) confusing, as only one of the opponents has long hair. The description should be corrected to state that the man in black retreats while being pursued, and that the man with the blue lightsaber dodges to the right.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man in black robes, wielding a double-bladed red lightsaber, spins his weapon as a long-haired man with a green lightsaber steps forward to engage him. A second man in off-white robes with shorter hair, wielding a blue lightsaber, quickly joins the fight. The two press their attack, forcing the man in black to move backward as he defends against both opponents simultaneously. He spins his double-bladed weapon to parry their strikes, and the man with the blue lightsaber dodges to the right. The three men move rapidly around each other, their lightsabers clashing in a flurry of strikes and parries that produce bright flashes of light.",
