  "generated_critique": "The caption includes unnecessary details about the setting and uses subjective language such as \"adding a sense of calm movement,\" which does not align with the instruction to avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. The caption should focus solely on the subject’s motion in clear, chronological order. A more appropriate caption would be: \"A person pushes a stroller along the stone pathway, moving steadily from the left side of the frame toward the center.\" This revision removes redundant scene description and subjective language, and clearly describes the subject’s motion as required.",
