The claim of \"subtle movement from insects and dry grass\" is speculative and not clearly visible, violating the instruction to avoid describing uncertain details. The description of the landscape, while accurate, is more detailed than necessary for a static shot. The caption should be revised to simply state that the video is a static shot of a burnt, rocky landscape with no discernible movement.",
