The instruction for videos with no movement is to \"briefly mention that without going into too much detail\" in one to three sentences. The current caption is four sentences long and includes unnecessary details about the scene's appearance. Additionally, the phrase \"at either sunrise or sunset\" is speculative, violating the rule to avoid ambiguous options like \"A or B.\" The caption should be revised to be a concise statement noting the static nature of the computer-generated airport scene.",
