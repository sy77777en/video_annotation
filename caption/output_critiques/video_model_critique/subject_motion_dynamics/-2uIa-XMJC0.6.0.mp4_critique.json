    "pre_caption": "The camera moves forward across a bridge, following several cars, including a red sports car, a purple car, and a black tricycle. A person in white on a hoverboard jumps from the bridge's side railing, landing on the road amidst the moving vehicles. The hoverboarder then continues to travel forward along with the cars.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases a person on a hoverboard, dressed in a white vest, white pants, and a white hat, as they skillfully jump from the air onto the bridge's road railing and then onto the road itself, navigating through the traffic. The bridge is structured with a central car lane and pedestrian and bicycle lanes on either side. The traffic includes red, purple, and black sports cars, black sedans, and black tricycles. The scene is dynamic, highlighting the hoverboarder's impressive maneuvers amidst the bustling vehicles.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the camera's action rather than the subjects' motion and contains a subjective adjective. The instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions\" and to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption begins by describing the camera's movement (\"The camera weaves through traffic... skillfully tracking\") and uses the subjective word \"skillfully.\" Furthermore, it inaccurately states the camera is tracking the person on the hoverboard from the start; the camera's focus shifts between several different vehicles before the person on the hoverboard jumps onto the road. The description should be rephrased to chronologically detail the actions of the vehicles and the person. A more accurate description would be: \"Several vehicles, including a red sports car, a purple car, and a black tricycle, drive across a bridge as a person in white on a hoverboard travels on the side walkway. The person then jumps from the walkway onto the road amidst the moving traffic and continues to travel forward.\"",
