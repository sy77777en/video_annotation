  "generated_critique": "The caption includes subjective adjectives and abstract descriptions, such as \"warm,\" \"dynamic,\" \"immersive,\" and \"vertiginous,\" as well as the phrase \"enhancing the dynamic and immersive quality,\" which violate the instructions. Additionally, the description of the staircase's appearance (\"The warm, orange-colored walls contrast with the dark, ornate metal railings, creating a spiraling, geometric pattern...\") is unnecessary, as the instructions state to focus on motion rather than visual details. The caption should be revised to describe only the camera's movement, which is a smooth and continuous counterclockwise rotation from a low-angle perspective looking up the stairwell.",
