    "pre_caption": "Several people walk along the stone sidewalk in both directions, some moving away from the camera and others approaching. A few individuals cross the street at the crosswalk, while others stand or walk near the storefronts on the opposite side. A car drives down the street, passing through the intersection as pedestrians continue to move along the sidewalks and crosswalk.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption generally follows the instruction by describing the motion of people and the car in chronological order, specifying that people walk along the sidewalk in both directions, some cross the street, and a car drives through the intersection. However, the caption could be improved by clarifying the sequence of actions more precisely. For example, it should note that two people in the foreground walk away from the camera along the sidewalk, while others walk toward the camera, and that the black car moves slowly through the intersection as pedestrians continue walking and waiting at the crosswalk. The mention of people standing or walking near storefronts is accurate but could be more concise, as the main focus is on the motion along the sidewalk and crosswalk. The caption does not include any speculative or emotional language and avoids unnecessary appearance details, which is good. To improve, the caption should more clearly present the order of actions and focus on the most salient motions visible in the video, such as the two people walking away from the camera, the car passing through the intersection, and the ongoing pedestrian movement.",
