    "pre_caption": "The first-person perspective moves forward and pans slightly to the right, navigating through a dense, underwater mushroom forest. As the view advances, a large school of small, glowing green, leaf-shaped creatures swims from left to right across the middle of the scene. Simultaneously, a single, thin, glowing blue, ribbon-like creature swims from the right side of the frame to the left, passing behind one of the large stalks. The gloved hands at the bottom of the screen remain relatively still in the frame as the viewer moves through the environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A first-person perspective reveals an underwater scene within a dense, bioluminescent forest. The environment is filled with tall, stalk-like structures resembling giant mushrooms, which have greenish, textured trunks and large, flat, reddish-pink caps with a honeycomb pattern on their undersides. Some of these trunks are adorned with glowing purple rings and are wrapped in glowing green, spiral-shaped organisms. A large school of small, glowing green, leaf-shaped creatures swims through the middle of the scene. A single, thin, ribbon-like creature glowing bright blue also swims past. At the bottom of the view, a pair of dark gray and orange gloved hands are visible, indicating the perspective of a person in a suit.**",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the gloved hands \"intermittently appear[ing] and disappear[ing]\" is inaccurate; the hands remain consistently visible at the bottom of the frame throughout the video. This sentence should be removed. Additionally, the description of the blue creature swimming \"away from the camera\" is imprecise; it swims laterally from the right side of the screen to the left. Finally, the school of green creatures does not \"disappear\"; they swim around the central area, with some moving out of the frame.",
