  "generated_critique": "The caption uses subjective adjectives like \"ominous\" and \"dramatic,\" and speculative phrasing like \"what appears to be,\" all of which are forbidden by the instructions. The final sentence describing the light on the horizon does not focus on motion and should be removed. Most importantly, the caption fails to mention a key motion event: a small, conical funnel cloud forms under the storm's base and then dissipates. A more accurate caption would describe the storm system's progression across the landscape, the rotation within the cloud base, and the brief formation and dissipation of the funnel cloud.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This time-lapse video shows a large supercell thunderstorm moving from left to right over a rural landscape. The dark base of the storm rotates, and a small, conical funnel cloud forms beneath it before quickly dissipating. The storm system continues to advance across the fields.",
