The instruction states, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail\" and \"If the video is a scenery shot without salient subjects... briefly note this in one to three sentences.\" The current caption is a detailed description of the cityscape's appearance, including buildings, solar panels, and fans, which is contrary to the instruction's focus on motion. The caption should be revised to remove the detailed scenic description and instead briefly state that the video is a static shot with no significant movement.",
