The phrase \"creating a powerful and ominous spectacle\" is also subjective and should be deleted. The final sentence, \"The clip captures the dynamic nature of the storm,\" is an abstract description and should be removed. The caption describes a static state (\"clouds are illuminated\") rather than the motion itself. It should be revised to describe the action of the lightning, specifying that sheet lightning flashes intermittently within the clouds, causing them to glow, while forked lightning bolts strike across the sky below the main cloud mass.",
