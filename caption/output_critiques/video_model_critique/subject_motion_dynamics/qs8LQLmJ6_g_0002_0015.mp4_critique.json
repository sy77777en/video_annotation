  "generated_critique": "The caption fails to describe the motion of the subjects in the video, which are the cars on the road. Instead, it focuses on the camera's motion and provides a detailed, subjective description of the scenery. The instructions state to focus on the subject's motion if salient subjects are present. The caption also includes several subjective adjectives such as \"dynamic,\" \"scenic,\" \"smoothly,\" \"warm,\" and \"hazy,\" which are explicitly forbidden by the instructions. The description should be revised to focus on the movement of the cars and remove the subjective language and excessive scenic details.",
