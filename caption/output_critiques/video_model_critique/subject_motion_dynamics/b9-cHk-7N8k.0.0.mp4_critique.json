  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly uses the speculative phrase \"sunrise or sunset,\" which is an ambiguous option that should be replaced with a factual description of the lighting, such as \"low, golden light.\" Additionally, the phrase \"enhancing the picturesque view\" is subjective and should be removed to adhere to the instruction to avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. The description of the camera's zoom is appropriate as it is the only motion occurring in the video.",
