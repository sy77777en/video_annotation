It omits any mention of the large, golden 3D text \"EXTREME VENGEANCE\" that materializes over the cityscape and then fades away. The description should focus on this action, as it is the most salient event. Additionally, the caption incorrectly describes the shot as \"level-angle\" when it is a high-angle shot. The current text only describes the static scenery, which violates the instruction to focus on the subject's motion.",
