The instructions specify describing \"the subject's motion\" and state that for scenery shots without salient subjects, one should simply note this fact. This video is a scenery shot revealing an alleyway, and it does not contain any clear, moving subjects. The caption should be revised to state that this is a scenery shot without subject motion, instead of detailing the camera's pan and tilt.",
