  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly uses the ambiguous phrase \"sunrise or sunset,\" which violates the instruction to avoid \"ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\" This should be replaced with a more direct observation, such as \"with the sun low on the horizon.\" The description of the camera's motion (\"The video captures... with the camera smoothly zooming in\") is meta and should be rephrased to describe the visual effect on the scene, for example, \"The scene slowly zooms in...\" to better integrate it into the description. Additionally, the description of the boats as \"actively moving\" is too general; it should be more specific, noting that some boats move across the water while others appear stationary.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A scenic, static shot captures a wide river with the sun low on the horizon, casting the scene in a hazy, golden light. The sun's bright reflection shimmers on the water, where some small boats drift slowly and others appear stationary. In the distance, a city skyline is silhouetted against the bright sky, while a few birds fly overhead. In the foreground, a small hut sits on the grassy riverbank.",
