  "generated_critique": "The caption uses subjective and emotional adjectives such as \"dynamic,\" \"grandeur,\" \"lively,\" and \"picturesque,\" which are explicitly forbidden by the instructions. It also includes introductory phrases like \"This video presents\" and focuses on describing the static scenery (\"architecture,\" \"gardens\") rather than the motion. The caption mentions that there is \"significant motion from the clouds and vehicles\" but fails to describe *how* they are moving. It should be revised to remove the subjective language and instead provide a direct, objective description of the movement, detailing how the clouds travel across the sky and how the vehicles move on the road in the time-lapse footage.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a time-lapse, wide-angle shot of Buckingham Palace and the Victoria Memorial, clouds move rapidly from left to right across the sky. On the road in the midground, vehicles travel at an accelerated speed. The camera begins with a static view before panning slightly to the right.",
