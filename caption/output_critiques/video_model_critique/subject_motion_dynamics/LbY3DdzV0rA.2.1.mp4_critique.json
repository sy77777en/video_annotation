  "generated_critique": "The caption includes subjective adjectives such as \"dramatic,\" \"immense,\" \"powerful,\" and \"turbulent,\" which should be removed. The description should focus solely on the visible motion rather than interpreting its nature or mentioning the \"time-lapse effect,\" which is a filmmaking technique. The first sentence is introductory and should be integrated into the description of the motion. A more compliant caption would describe the clouds' movement directly, for instance: \"A large system of dark storm clouds rapidly churns and swirls as it moves across the sky above a cityscape.\"",
