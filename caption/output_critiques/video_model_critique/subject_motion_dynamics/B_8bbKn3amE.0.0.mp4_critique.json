    "pre_caption": "A herd of alpacas is initially scattered across a grassy hillside, with some standing and others lying down. As the camera advances, several alpacas begin to run as a group across the terrain. They move from left to right, with a few individuals running very close past the camera. In the distance, a single white alpaca stands still before moving out of the frame from the bottom right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A herd of alpacas populates the landscape. These animals have long necks, slender legs, and shaggy wool coats in shades of brown, cream, and white. Initially, they are scattered across a grassy hill, with some standing, others sitting, or walking. Several alpacas then begin to run. Some alpacas pass very close to the camera before moving out of view, primarily due to camera movements. A single white alpaca is also visible standing alone in the distance before moving out of view from the bottom right.**",

  "generated_critique": "The phrase \"In the distance\" is inaccurate, as the single white alpaca is in the foreground on the right. The description \"A few individuals appear very close to the camera as it moves past them\" is passive; it should be rephrased to actively describe the alpacas' motion, for example, \"A few individuals run past the camera at close range.\" Additionally, the description of the main group's movement could be more specific by noting that they run \"uphill\" and to the left. Finally, the last action of the white alpaca could be more precise; instead of \"moving,\" specify that it \"walks\" or \"trots\" out of the frame.",
