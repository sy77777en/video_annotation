The first and last sentences (\"This is a scenic, extreme wide shot...\" and \"The scene is set on a bright, sunny day...\") are descriptive scene-setting and should be removed to adhere to the instruction to focus on motion. The core description of the pan is good, but it could more explicitly state the direction of movement. A better caption would focus solely on the camera's movement, stating that it pans from left to right across the London skyline, causing the portion of Tower Bridge to exit the frame while revealing more of the modern architecture along the riverbank.",
