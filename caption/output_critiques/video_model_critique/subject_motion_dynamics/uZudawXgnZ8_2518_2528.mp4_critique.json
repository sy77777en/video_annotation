    "pre_caption": "A pixelated character walks north from a farmhouse, turns west onto a dirt path, and then moves south toward a smaller wooden building. As the character approaches, a chick emerges from the building, and a red heart icon briefly appears above it. The character then walks south and west, circling a fenced-in area, before heading toward a structure under construction on the left side of the screen. Throughout the video, several white butterflies flutter in various parts of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a pixel-art farm scene, a structure in the lower-left appears to be under construction or in a state of ruin, featuring a gray concrete foundation with exposed brown and gray pipes and surrounded by a wooden frame. A light purple butterfly is visible on this concrete slab. A character with gray hair, a red shirt, and blue pants is present on the farm. The scene also includes a wooden farmhouse with a red roof and a smaller, separate wooden building, likely a chicken coop, in front of which a red heart icon briefly appears above a chick. The environment consists of numerous green trees, a river with a waterfall, and a small tilled garden plot with green sprouts. On-screen indicators in the corners display the time and date, and a red \"Out of water\" message appears momentarily, while a toolbar at the bottom shows various tools.**",

However, the description of the character's subsequent motion is too generic and misses a key action. Instead of stating the character \"shifts to the right while moving up and down in an irregular pattern,\" the caption should specify that the character moves into a patch of blue bushes and clears them, causing them to disappear. This detail is a significant part of the character's action and interaction with the environment in the latter half of the video.",
