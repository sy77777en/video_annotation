The instructions state that for a scenery shot with no movement, the caption should briefly note this fact. The current caption describes the colors, lighting, and textures of the forest but completely omits mentioning that the video is a static shot with no movement. The caption should be revised to state that this is a static, top-down aerial view of a forest, and there is no movement in the scene.",
