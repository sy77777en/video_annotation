    "pre_caption": "The view of a digital mountain landscape rotates horizontally, causing the 2D layers of the illustration to separate and reveal their arrangement in 3D space. This motion shows distinct layers for foreground trees, a midground utility pole, and the background mountains. The view then rotates back, causing the layers to slide together and re-form the composite image. The process repeats as the view rotates in the opposite direction, again separating the layers to display their structure from a different angle before settling on a side view of the separated elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A digital illustration of a mountain landscape is shown being deconstructed into its component layers. The complete scene depicts a valley filled with dark green pine trees, flanked by a large, rocky, tan and brown mountain under a light blue sky with white clouds. A brown wooden utility pole with crossbars stands among the trees. The illustration is then rotated horizontally, revealing its 3D layer structure, with the foreground trees, midground utility poles, and the combined forest and mountains in the background. Some individual pine trees are shown isolated on a transparent background before the layers rotate back together to form the composite view.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the motion in chronological order. However, it can be made more concise for better readability. The second sentence, \"This motion shows distinct layers for foreground trees, a midground utility pole, and the background mountains,\" is slightly redundant and could be integrated into the first sentence. For example, you could say \"...causing the 2D layers of the illustration, including foreground trees and a midground utility pole, to separate...\". Additionally, the phrase \"The process repeats as the view rotates in the opposite direction\" can be rephrased more directly to something like \"The view then rotates in the opposite direction...\" to improve the flow.",
