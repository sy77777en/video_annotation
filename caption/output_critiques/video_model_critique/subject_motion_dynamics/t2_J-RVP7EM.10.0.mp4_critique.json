    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video showcases an abstract, monochromatic animated scene featuring a deep, circular vortex viewed from above, as if looking down a tunnel. The vortex visually rotates in a clockwise direction, drawing the viewer's attention inward toward a brilliant, white, circular light at its center. The walls of the tunnel are composed of a dense, swirling mass of countless greyish-white, sculpted figures. These figures, which are ambiguous but resemble winged humanoids or angels, are intricately intertwined and layered, creating a complex, textured surface that recedes into the distance toward the central light. The outer edges of the vortex fade into complete darkness, creating a strong vignette effect that draws the eye toward the illuminated center.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately describes the motion. The statement \"giving the impression of moving away from the bright, white light\" is incorrect; the viewpoint is actually moving away from the light, this is not an impression or illusion. The illusion is the clockwise rotation of the vortex itself. The description should be rephrased to first state the actual camera movement and then describe the resulting visual effect. A more accurate description would be: The viewpoint moves backward and rotates counter-clockwise through a circular vortex. This movement creates the illusion that the vortex is rotating clockwise, with its walls appearing to spiral inward toward the central light.",
