    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective within a submersible, the vehicle moves forward and descends deeper into a dark, underwater cavern.

In the background, small schools of fish swim through the murky water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video presents a first-person perspective from the cockpit of a submersible navigating a dark, deep-sea cavern. The view is framed by the vehicle's interior, which features two glowing green screens and a heads-up display showing a depth of over 770 meters, vehicle integrity, and oxygen levels. Outside the submersible, the water has a murky, green tint. A large, serpentine, and semi-translucent creature with a visible, ribcage-like skeletal structure swims on the right side of the scene. It passes by a large, rectangular, and segmented alien-like structure that has glowing green rectangular lights along its side. The cavern is also filled with clusters of small, glowing blue orbs, dark, tendril-like growths hanging from the rocky edge of the cave, and schools of small, indistinct fish swimming in both the middle ground and the background.**",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the serpentine creature's movement is slightly clunky and could be more precise. The caption states the creature \"initially swims out of the frame from the right and then reappears,\" but at the start of the video, only the creature's tail is visible as it moves away. A more direct and accurate description would be to state that as the submersible advances, the creature swims into view from the right, as this is its most significant action in the clip. The rest of the description of the submersible's and the small fishes' motion is accurate.",
