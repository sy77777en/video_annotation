    "pre_caption": "At the beginning of the sequence, a dark figure walks away and exits the frame on the right. A dark sedan then drives into view from the left, its headlight beam sweeping across the scene and illuminating a person lying on the sidewalk. The car proceeds to drive out of the frame to the right, while the person on the ground remains motionless throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In this 2D animation, a person wearing a dark coat, a white top, and dark pants lies motionless on their side on a sidewalk, facing the camera. At the beginning of the sequence, a dark, indistinct figure walks away and exits on the right. Subsequently, a dark-colored sedan with its bright headlights on drives into view from the left. The car's beam of light illuminates the person on the ground as it travels across the scene before disappearing to the right, leaving the first person still lying on the sidewalk.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a factual error and a speculative statement. The dark figure exits the frame on the left, not the right. Additionally, the car is never visible; only its headlight beam is seen moving across the scene. The description should be corrected to state that the figure walks away and exits on the left. The mention of a \"dark sedan\" should be removed and replaced with a description of the headlight beam sweeping from left to right, illuminating the person on the sidewalk. The final sentence about the car driving out of the frame should also be removed as it describes an event that is not shown.",
