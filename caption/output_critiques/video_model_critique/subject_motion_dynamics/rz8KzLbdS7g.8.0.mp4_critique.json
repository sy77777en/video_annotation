To be more concise and focused on the action as per the instructions for scenery shots, the description should be shortened to focus only on the camera's movement and what it reveals. For instance, the caption could be revised to: \"This scenery shot features a slow trucking movement to the left, starting with a view of a traditional Japanese house and panning to reveal a quiet residential street.\"",
