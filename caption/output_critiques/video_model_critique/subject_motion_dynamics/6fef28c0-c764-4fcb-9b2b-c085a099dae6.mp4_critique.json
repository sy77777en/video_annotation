    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video reveals three people standing together, their forms blurred by motion. The sequence begins with their reflections on a polished surface before tilting up to their bodies. On the left stands a light-skinned woman who appears to be Asian, wearing a dark, sleeveless gown. In the center is a person with a lighter complexion dressed in a light-colored, mid-length sleeve shirt and matching trousers. To the right, another person with a lighter complexion wears a white collared shirt, a dark vest, and dark trousers. The woman on the left and the person in the center are holding champagne flutes, while the person on the right is holding a tray with a glass of champagne on it.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several factual errors and speculative statements that are not supported by the video. The video does not show the camera tilting from a high to a low angle or moving from reflections; it is a single, continuous low-angle shot. Due to the extreme motion blur, specific actions like \"picks up a glass,\" \"turns to the woman,\" \"smiles at her,\" \"clink glasses,\" and a person \"holds the tray\" are not visible. These descriptions violate the instruction to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" The caption should be revised to remove these speculative details and instead accurately describe the observable motion. A more accurate description would focus on the rapid, blurry movement of three indistinct figures as seen from a low angle, noting that they appear to be holding glasses.",
