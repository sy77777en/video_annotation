However, it also describes the camera's motion (\"The camera slowly pans from right to left\"). The instructions specify focusing on the motion of subjects *within* the video, and the camera is not a subject in the scene. For a scenery shot with no moving subjects, the instructions state to simply note the lack of subject motion. Therefore, the sentence \"The camera slowly pans from right to left across the room\" should be removed to adhere more strictly to the guidelines.",
