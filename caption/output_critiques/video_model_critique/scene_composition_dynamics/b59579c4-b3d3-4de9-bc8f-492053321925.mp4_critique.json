    "pre_caption": "In an outdoor urban setting at dusk, a person runs along an elevated roadway. The scene is characterized by a strong color contrast between the deep blue of the sky and the bright yellow of the surrounding structures. A row of modern, yellow streetlights lines the left side of the asphalt path. On the right, a long, yellow concrete barrier covered in graffiti is topped by a blue metal railing. In the background, the faint lights of a city are visible beneath the dark sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**An objective POV shot where the camera captures the scene from a detached, observational perspective. (no need to mention).**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but misses a key required element and could be more concise. It correctly identifies the outdoor urban setting at dusk, the running subject, and the prominent yellow and blue visual elements like the barriers, railings, and streetlights. However, it fails to describe the point of view, which is a tracking shot following the runner from behind, a specific requirement of the instructions. The description of the yellow structure on the right as just \"a single yellow structure\" is an oversimplification; it is a large, distinct, arch-like structure over the roadway. Additionally, the caption is slightly redundant, mentioning the \"striking contrast\" and then the \"vivid contrast\" later. The description could be streamlined by integrating the color contrast into the description of the elements themselves rather than stating it as a separate characteristic.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This tracking shot follows a man from behind as he runs along an elevated urban roadway at dusk. The scene is defined by a strong blue and yellow color palette: a row of yellow streetlights lines the left side of the path, while a yellow, graffiti-covered barrier with a blue railing runs along the right. Ahead, a large yellow archway spans the road, set against a deep blue sky with faint city lights visible in the background.",
