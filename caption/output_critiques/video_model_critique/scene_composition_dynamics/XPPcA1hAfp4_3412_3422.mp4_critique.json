    "pre_caption": "A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows an underground cave setting, where the camera is placed above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides. The dimly lit scene, illuminated by numerous flickering torches, features a natural cave area on the left with dirt ground, patches of green moss, and reddish, organic-looking terrain. To the right, a large, cross-shaped wooden platform is constructed over a body of dark water. This platform is furnished with various items, including green, red, and blue chests, beds, and crafting stations like a furnace and an anvil. A small, pixelated character walks from a fenced path in the cave onto the wooden platform. Overlays are present on the screen: health and status bars are in the top-left corner, a mini-map is in the top-right, an inventory hotbar is at the bottom-center, and controller button prompts are in the bottom-right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the overall scene, including the point of view, environment, setting, time of day, and notable visual elements like overlays. For notable visual elements within the scene, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. If subjects are present, ensure their placement and context complement the scene without excessive detail. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf relevant, indicate the **point of view**, such as first-person, drone shot, or dashcam, and describe how it influences the viewer’s perception. Specify the **setting** by clearly identifying whether it is indoors or outdoors, using precise language. If the location is known, state it explicitly (e.g., \"Times Square\" or \"Tokyo subway station\"). Otherwise, describe defining features such as “a narrow alley with graffiti-covered walls” or “a vast desert with rolling dunes.” Mention the **time of day** and any notable **architectural or natural features**, such as buildings, roads, forests, or bodies of water. Include relevant **weather conditions** if applicable, like “a rainy street with wet pavement reflecting city lights” or “a snowy mountain pass covered in thick fog.” For indoor settings, describe key **furniture or props** that establish the environment, such as “a wooden desk cluttered with books and a vintage lamp.” If notable, mention the **style** of the scene, such as a monochromatic color scheme or a vibrant carnival with neon lights. If the video contains **overlay elements** such as text, titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements, specify that they are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIf the scene involves **motion or changes**, describe natural elements like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing against the shore, as well as human-made movements such as traffic flowing on a highway or pedestrians walking along a busy street. If **scene transitions** occur, explain how they happen, whether through changes in time (e.g., “The shot transitions from day to night”) or movement-based shifts (e.g., “The camera pans to reveal an alley behind the main street”). Use precise language to refer to different elements within the scene, prioritizing the most prominent details and organizing descriptions logically from the overall setting to more specific features.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Do not infer the role of the scene setting. Do not explain what the scene emphasizes or highlights. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph. Focus on the setting and scenery, not on detailed descriptions of the subject.\n\nPlease note that the video includes overlay elements, such as text or visuals like titles, subtitles, captions, icons, watermarks, heads-up displays (HUD), or framing elements. In your description, specify that these are overlays (not part of the scene) and describe their content and placement.\n\nIn addition, you do not need to infer the camera's point of view, as this information is already provided. Please integrate the following point of view information into your caption:\n\nPoint of View Information: \"**A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides.**\"",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a factual error and could be more concise. The description of the placement preview is incorrect; it states the preview appears \"above the selected hotbar item,\" but the video shows the transparent white preview appearing in the game world where the character is aiming to build. The opening sentence is redundant in its explanation of the top-down view; \"A gaming video with a top-down... looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides\" can be shortened. The caption also lists \"wooden floors\" as a hotbar item, but the item is simply wood planks. Finally, the last sentence describing the \"Swap hotbar\" prompts is overly detailed for a concise summary and should be removed to improve focus on the primary scene elements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In this top-down, pixel-art gaming video, a character explores a dimly lit underground cave. To the left is a natural cavern with reddish terrain, while on the right, a large, cross-shaped wooden platform is built over water, furnished with chests, beds, and crafting stations. The character walks along a fenced path, places another fence post, which is visualized by a transparent white preview in the game world, and then steps onto the main platform. Game interface elements are visible, including health bars in the top-left, a mini-map in the top-right, and an inventory hotbar at the bottom displaying items like wood planks and torches.",
