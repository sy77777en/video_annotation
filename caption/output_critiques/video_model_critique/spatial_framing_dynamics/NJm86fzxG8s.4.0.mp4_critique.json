    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide, high-angle shot of a snow-covered landscape. A small, glowing house sits in the center of the frame, positioned on a mountain peak in the middle ground. A faintly illuminated path begins in the bottom left foreground and winds its way up the slope to the house. The mountain occupies the lower half of the frame, extending from the middle ground toward the foreground. The entire scene is enveloped in thick fog, obscuring the background, while specks of falling snow drift throughout the frame, creating a sense of depth. The camera remains static, looking down on the scene from above.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot of a vast, desolate, and snow-covered mountain range under a gray, overcast sky. A heavy fog or mist blankets the scene, obscuring the distance, while soft snowflakes drift down through the air. The focus of the shot is on the immense scale and cold, solitary atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific subject. At the summit of the snow-capped mountain, there is a small house with a gabled roof completely covered in snow. The house features brick-red walls and a small dark red chimney. A warm, golden light emanates from within the house, contrasting with the cold, muted tones of the surrounding landscape and illuminating a faint path leading up the slope.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark and foggy nocturnal setting, a small house with a gabled roof sits atop a snow-covered peak, entirely blanketed in snow. The house features brick-red walls and a small, dark red chimney, emitting a warm, golden glow from within. The surrounding landscape consists of soft, rolling mounds of white snow, partially obscured by thick gray fog. A faint, illuminated path winds up the slope toward the glowing house. Small white specks of falling snow drift through the air, completing the desolate, wintry scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the path's movement is confusing and inaccurate. It states the path \"begins in the bottom left\" and then \"appears to originate from the bottom right\" as the camera moves. A more accurate description would be to state that as the camera arcs clockwise, the visible portion of the path shifts its position within the frame from the bottom left toward the bottom right. Additionally, the final sentence, \"The camera moves in a clockwise arc, looking down on the scene from above,\" is redundant, as both the camera movement and the high angle were already mentioned. This sentence should be removed, and the description of the camera's movement should be integrated more smoothly with its effect on the scene. Finally, describing the central object as a \"house\" is an interpretation; a more neutral term like \"glowing structure\" would better adhere to the instruction to avoid describing uncertain elements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From an extreme wide, high-angle perspective, the camera slowly arcs clockwise over a snow-covered landscape. In the center, a small, glowing structure sits on a mountain peak. A faintly illuminated path winds up the slope to the structure; as the camera moves, the path's visible origin shifts from the bottom left of the frame toward the bottom right. The mountain occupies the lower half of the frame, extending from the middle ground toward the foreground.
