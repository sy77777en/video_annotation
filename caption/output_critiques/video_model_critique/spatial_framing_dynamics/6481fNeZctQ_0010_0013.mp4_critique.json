    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a vast landscape with no main subject. An expansive sunflower field fills the foreground and middle ground, extending from the bottom of the frame toward the center, with its neat rows creating strong leading lines. In the middle ground, a dense line of trees is positioned slightly left of center, with a smaller, separate clump of trees to the right. The background, occupying the top third of the frame, is composed of rolling hills and more fields under a pale sky. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down on the scene. Throughout the shot, the camera performs a slow dolly zoom, moving backward while simultaneously zooming in, which causes the foreground sunflowers to expand within the frame while the middle-ground trees and background hills appear to compress and remain relatively static in size.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot featuring an expansive field of vibrant yellow sunflowers stretching towards the horizon. The flowers are planted in neat, parallel rows that create a strong sense of perspective, drawing the eye into the distance where a cluster of dark green trees and rolling hills are visible under a pale blue sky. There is no main subject in this shot, as the focus is intentionally placed on the vastness and natural beauty of the agricultural environment. The composition emphasizes the scale of the field and the serene atmosphere of the rural setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone moves backward while zooming in over a vast, outdoor field of bright yellow sunflowers on a sunny day. The flowers are planted in straight, parallel rows that stretch toward the horizon, with the brown soil visible between them. In the mid-ground, a dense line of dark green trees stands amidst the yellow fields, with a smaller, separate clump of trees to the right. The background is composed of rolling hills and more agricultural land under a pale blue, hazy sky. The video is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the camera's position as being at a \"level angle.\" The shot is clearly taken from a high vantage point, looking down and across the landscape, which should be described as a high-angle or aerial shot. The phrase \"looking straight at the scene\" is also redundant. The description should be corrected to state that the camera is positioned at a high angle above the landscape.",
