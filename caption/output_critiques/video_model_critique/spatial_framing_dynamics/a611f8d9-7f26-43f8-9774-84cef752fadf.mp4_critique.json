    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot is captured from a low-angle, forward-facing perspective inside a moving vehicle, with the focus on the environment rather than a specific subject. In the immediate foreground, out-of-focus raindrops are scattered across the entire frame. The middle ground and background are composed of a tunnel that curves to the right. The tunnel's ceiling occupies the top of the frame, while its walls extend from the left and right sides, receding into the background to create depth. As the camera moves forward through the tunnel, the perspective shifts, causing the vanishing point to move from the center toward the right side of the frame, following the curve of the road.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an urban infrastructure scenery shot capturing a point-of-view perspective from a vehicle driving through a curved, brightly lit tunnel at night. Rows of brilliant white lights line the flat ceiling and curved walls, their glow reflecting and refracting through numerous raindrops scattered across the windshield, creating a blurred and dynamic visual effect. There is no main subject because the focus is on the immersive atmosphere and the environmental experience of traveling through the structure. The shot emphasizes the dynamic interplay of light and motion rather than highlighting a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera, the scene captures the perspective of driving through a well-lit tunnel at night. The tunnel has a flat ceiling and curved walls lined with rows of bright, white lights. The walls appear to be made of off-white or light-colored tiles, with a distinct yellow-tiled stripe running horizontally along the side. The view is seen through a wet windshield, with out-of-focus water droplets scattered across the surface, creating small, bright blurs where they catch the light.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
