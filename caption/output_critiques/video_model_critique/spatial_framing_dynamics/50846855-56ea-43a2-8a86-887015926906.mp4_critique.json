    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a skydiver in the center of the frame, viewed from a camera positioned slightly below them. The skydiver is in the foreground, set against a background of the sky and a distant landscape at the bottom of the frame. The perspective then transitions to an extreme wide shot from a high-angle position directly above the subject. In this new framing, the skydiver remains in the center foreground but appears much smaller, positioned over a sprawling city and airfield that fill the middle ground and background. The camera continues to tilt downwards, moving past the skydiver to conclude on a top-down view that fills the entire frame with the landscape below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person is shown in mid-air during a skydive, viewed from both in front and from above. They are wearing a light blue long-sleeved top over a darker collared shirt, dark pants, and dark gloves. On their head is a light blue helmet and a pair of goggles. A dark parachute pack is strapped to their back, and a watch is on their left wrist. The person holds their body in a stable freefall position with their arms outstretched to the sides, falling towards a city below.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins with a person in skydiving gear, including a blue helmet and goggles, freefalling with arms outstretched against a clear blue sky. The camera then tilts downward as the skydiver descends, transitioning to a high-angle perspective of the vast landscape below. The ground is a sprawling mix of urban and suburban development, characterized by a grid of streets, buildings, and patches of green. A prominent highway cuts through the city, and an airfield with visible runways is situated near the edge of the developed area, which is bordered by arid, hilly terrain. As the skydiver becomes smaller, they remain visible within the expansive view of the ground during the bright daytime.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption fails to specify the shot size at any point, only noting that the skydiver \"appears smaller,\" which is not specific enough. It also completely omits the skydiver's 2D position within the frame, which is a key requirement; the skydiver remains centered throughout the video. While the description of the camera angle change is accurate (\"level-angle\" to \"high-angle\" to \"top-down\"), the description of the overall spatial transition could be more integrated. The final two sentences describe a single, continuous camera movement and should be combined. To improve, the caption should state the initial shot size (medium-long shot) and the skydiver's central position. It should then describe the camera's downward tilt, which transitions the framing to a high-angle, extreme long shot, where the skydiver remains centered but is now a small figure above the background cityscape.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a medium-long shot of a skydiver, centered in the frame from a level-angle perspective against the sky. The camera then begins a continuous downward tilt, transitioning the framing to a high-angle, extreme long shot where the skydiver remains a small, central figure above a sprawling cityscape. The tilt continues, moving past the skydiver to conclude on a top-down view that fills the frame with the landscape below.",
