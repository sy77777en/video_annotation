    "pre_caption": "The scene is presented in a wide shot from a high, tilted overhead angle. Initially, a small figure occupies the lower-left quadrant of the frame in the middle ground, while a larger figure in a red robe stands in the background toward the upper right. The landscape is filled with numerous stone pillars scattered across the middle and background. The small figure walks from the lower left toward the center of the scene, and the camera pans slightly to the right to follow this movement. This camera motion repositions the large figure from the upper right to a more central location in the background. A subtitle briefly appears at the bottom center of the screen before disappearing. The camera maintains its high position above the subjects throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a stylized, snowy landscape, a young man with dark hair and a red headband is either walking or standing in the lower left. He is dressed in a white top with red rings on the arms, a dark fabric with white edges draped from the waist to the left shoulder, and red pants. His footwear is ambiguous, as he could be wearing sandals or be barefoot. Every time he takes a step, a circular orange glow appears under his feet. Initially in the upper right, a much larger figure with long purple hair and a helmet-like, pointed object on their head shifts to the center as the camera moves. This figure, whose gender is indistinct, is enveloped in a long red robe and appears to have their back to the camera, with a white, circular object on their right shoulder.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows a desolate, snow-covered outdoor landscape. The ground is blanketed in white snow, marked by a trail of footprints and patches of iridescent pink and purple light. Scattered throughout the area are numerous dark, cylindrical stone pillars, many of which are broken and all capped with snow. Larger ruined structures are visible and partially submerged in a reflective body of water that mirrors a dark sky featuring a large, pale moon. The bare branches of trees are mainly visible to the right of the frame or near the water. A bright blue glow emanates from the edge of the body of water, located in the upper right portion of the scene. A small figure is either standing or walking in the lower portion of the scene, while a larger figure in a red cloak is initially positioned in the upper right and later shifts to the center due to camera movement. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays the subtitle \"Father,\" which soon disappears. Initially, there is a white speech bubble containing \"...\" above the small figure, which also disappears shortly thereafter.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but can be improved for conciseness and clarity. The description of the high camera angle at both the beginning and the end of the paragraph is redundant; the final sentence should be removed. The description of the movement can be streamlined. Instead of describing the character's movement, the camera's movement, and the resulting repositioning in three separate clauses, combine them for better flow. For example: \"As the small figure walks from the lower left toward the larger one, the camera pans right, which keeps the small figure in the lower-left quadrant while shifting the large figure from the upper right toward the center-right of the frame.\" This phrasing is more dynamic and less repetitive.",
