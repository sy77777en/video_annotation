    "pre_caption": "In a static close-up shot, a man is framed from the shoulders up in the middle ground, positioned slightly to the right of the frame's center. To the far left, the out-of-focus back of a woman's head occupies the foreground, creating an over-the-shoulder perspective. In the background, a window to the right of the man shows a blurred landscape passing by. The camera remains stationary at the subjects' eye level throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man, who appears to be in his 40s, is shown in a close-up shot. He has shoulder-length, wavy, dark brown hair, along with a dark brown goatee and mustache. He is wearing a rust-colored jacket over a brown-grey collared shirt. He is seated and facing directly forward, slightly to the left of the frame, looking at another person with an attentive expression. To the left, the rear side of a woman's head is visible, though she is out of focus. She has reddish-brown hair and is positioned opposite the man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the scene is set inside a moving vehicle, likely a train, during the daytime. A man with shoulder-length, dark brown hair and a goatee sits in a dark, high-backed seat. To his right, a large window reveals a blurred green landscape passing by, indicating the vehicle is in motion. The interior walls are a neutral gray color. The rear-side of another person's head is partially visible in the foreground on the left.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

This element is the headrest of the man's seat, with another passenger partially visible in the background behind it.
