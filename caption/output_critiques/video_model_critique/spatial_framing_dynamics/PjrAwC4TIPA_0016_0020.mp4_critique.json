    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of three women in the middle ground and a medium shot of a fourth woman positioned low in the foreground center. The central woman of the back trio is in the middle ground center, flanked by the other two on her left and right. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, moves forward, transitioning to a medium shot as the woman in the foreground rises and moves her arms, briefly obscuring the central woman. The camera then pulls back, returning to a full shot, revealing a new formation where the woman who was in the foreground has moved back, and the central woman now stands in the foreground center, with the other three dancers positioned behind her in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Four women are shown performing a dance routine. The central woman has long, straight black hair and wears a black short-sleeved Adidas bodysuit with white stripes on the shoulders and cutouts at the waist, paired with a black mini-skirt and black footwear. Flanking her are two other women, both dressed in light gray spaghetti strap crop tops and matching light gray sweatpants. The woman on the right has a black half-up long ponytail, while the woman on the left has a golden-black two-tone half-up long ponytail and tattoos on her right arm and left shoulder. A fourth woman with dark hair styled in a single bun is positioned in the foreground, in front of the central woman, also wearing a light gray spaghetti strap top.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a brightly lit indoor space, characterized by a seamless, plain white background and a matching white floor. A subtle, soft pinkish-purple light creates a faint color gradient on the left side of the backdrop. Four women are performing a synchronized dance routine in the center of this minimalist environment. The woman in the middle wears a black short-sleeved athletic top with three white stripes on the shoulders and a small white logo, paired with a black skirt. The other three dancers wear matching light gray crop tops and loose-fitting light gray sweatpants.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the three girls in the back and a medium shot of the girl in the front. The camera first moves forward, transitioning to a medium shot, then moves backward again, returning to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the movement of the subjects during the transition. The sentence, \"She then moves to the right side of the frame,\" is inaccurate. The woman who rises from the foreground does not move across the frame to the right; she rises in the center and is revealed to be on the right side of the central woman in the final formation. The woman who was initially on the left side of the frame remains on the left. The description of the final formation is also slightly ambiguous. To improve accuracy and clarity, the middle section of the caption should be revised to state: \"...as the woman in the foreground rises, temporarily obscuring the central woman, while the woman on the far right moves into the background behind the central figure. The camera pulls back to a full shot, revealing a new formation where the central woman now stands in the foreground, flanked by the woman who was initially on the left and the newly risen woman now on the right.\"",

The two women who originally flanked her are now behind her to the left and right, and the woman who rose from the foreground is positioned directly behind the new central dancer, obscured from view.",
