    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a person is positioned in the center foreground, viewed from behind as they look out a window. The cityscape at night occupies the background, with the window's vertical frames visible on the left and right sides. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. Throughout the clip, the camera performs a very slow and subtle push-in, causing the framing on the subject to tighten slightly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black-and-white scene, a person is shown from the back, looking out over a cityscape at night. The individual has dark, curly hair visible above the hood of a dark hoodie, which is pulled up. They are wearing a dark, puffy jacket with horizontal quilted sections across the back.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot frames a character from the hip up, seen from behind as they look out a large window onto a sprawling cityscape at night. The entire scene is presented in black and white. Below, the dark urban landscape is illuminated by a dense pattern of lights from building windows and streets. The subject, positioned centrally, wears a dark, puffy, hooded jacket. The vertical frames of the window are visible on either side, and the video is presented within a white border.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that the camera is positioned \"at the subject's level.\" The video clearly shows a high-angle shot, with the camera positioned above the subject and looking down. Additionally, the description of the camera movement as \"maintaining the framing... unchanged\" is slightly contradictory, as the downward motion is itself a change in framing. It should be revised to simply state that the camera slowly moves or tilts downward.",
