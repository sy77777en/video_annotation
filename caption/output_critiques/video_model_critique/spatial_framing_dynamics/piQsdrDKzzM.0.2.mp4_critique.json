    "pre_caption": "A man is initially shown in a medium close-up, positioned in the left half of the frame and in the middle ground. He then turns and walks from left to right, moving deeper into the scene toward the background. As he moves, he approaches a car parked in the middle ground on the far right of the frame. The camera remains static and positioned at the man's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with medium-length dark hair and a full, trimmed beard is shown in profile. He wears gold-rimmed aviator sunglasses, a black bomber-style jacket, and a dark t-shirt. He turns and walks away from the camera, moving toward a dark-colored car that is partially visible on the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A dimly lit indoor parking garage is characterized by a low ceiling with exposed pipes and fluorescent light fixtures. Concrete pillars support the structure, and windows are visible in the background. A dark-colored car is parked on the right side of the space, its taillights casting a red glow against the wall. A man wearing sunglasses and a dark jacket turns to his left from the right and approaches the dark-colored car.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the camera's height relative to the subject. Additionally, the final clause, \"the shot concludes with a subtle forward movement after the pan,\" is inaccurate, as the primary camera movement is a continuous pan to the right that follows the subject; there is no distinct forward movement after the pan concludes. The description should be revised to include the camera height and more accurately describe the continuous camera motion.",
