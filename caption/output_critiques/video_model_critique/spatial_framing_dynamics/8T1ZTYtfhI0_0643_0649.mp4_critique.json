    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot from a low-angle perspective, capturing a person holding a large lobster in the center of the frame, submerged in the middle ground of the underwater scene. The camera then moves vertically upwards, breaking the surface of the water. The shot transitions to a medium shot at the subject's level, where the person is now in the center-middle ground, partially above the water. They hold the lobster up, positioning it in the foreground so its underside fills the bottom of the frame. The surrounding sea occupies the middle ground, and a distant coastline stretches across the horizon in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man in a blue and white patterned wetsuit is in the ocean, holding a very large spiny lobster. The man wears a black diving mask with a camera attached to it and a snorkel. He also has a black belt that holds several objects. The lobster is reddish-brown and orange with a segmented body, a wide fan-like tail, and long, thin antennae. The man is shown both underwater and at the surface, holding the lobster with both hands. When he surfaces, he holds the lobster up, displaying its lighter-colored underside and legs.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene transitions from a sunlit, underwater perspective in clear blue water to the surface of a choppy, bluish-turquoise sea. A person wearing a blue and white patterned wetsuit and a black snorkel mask is partially submerged, holding a large, reddish-brown spiny lobster. As the person emerges from the water, a low-lying, arid coastline appears on the right side of the horizon under a bright, clear sky, but it goes out of view as the camera pans and moves.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains several inaccuracies regarding the spatial depth and duration of visible elements. First, in the initial underwater scene, the person is in the center middle ground, not the foreground; they are holding the lobster out towards the foreground. Second, after surfacing, the caption states the person shifts to the \"center-right foreground,\" but they remain in the middle ground while the lobster is moved into the extreme foreground. Third, the description of the shot size after surfacing as \"the person occupies less than half of the frame's width and height\" is imprecise; it should be identified as a medium shot. Finally, the distant coastline is not \"briefly visible\"; it is visible on the horizon for the entire time the camera is above the water.",
