    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a silhouetted skier is initially positioned in the top left of the frame, in the middle ground, with the camera positioned below them. A large, snow-covered slope occupies the bottom left foreground, cutting diagonally across the scene, while the sky fills the background. The skier travels in an arc from the top left towards the center-right, descending towards the foreground slope, as a distant mountain range becomes visible in the background at the bottom right. The video then cuts to a high-angle wide shot, with the camera now positioned above the skier, who is located in the bottom left of the frame on the foreground slope which now fills the entire view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A skier, silhouetted and dressed in dark winter clothing consisting of a jacket, pants, and a helmet, is captured in mid-air. The person is on a pair of skis and is holding ski poles. During the jump, the skier performs an aerial trick, twisting their body and grabbing one of their skis before repositioning to land on a snow-covered slope that appears to be dark blue.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A silhouetted skier is captured mid-air against a vast, clear sky over a snowy mountain landscape. The scene begins with a cool, pale blue sky, which transitions to the warm yellow and orange hues of a sunset or sunrise, revealing the jagged peaks of a distant mountain range. A large, dark blue, snow-covered slope cuts diagonally across the foreground. The video then cuts to a dark, blue-tinted night scene on the same slope, where the skier is seen on the snow with a few trees visible in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a factual error regarding the movement of the mountain range, stating it goes \"out of frame from the top.\" In the video, the mountain range is revealed at the bottom right and remains in position until the scene cuts. The description of the transition as a \"shift\" is also imprecise; it should be identified as a \"hard cut\" for better accuracy. Furthermore, the caption omits a key detail about the second shot: the skier is on a dark, blue-tinted slope, which is a significant visual change from the first scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a wide shot from a low angle, a silhouetted skier is mid-air against a pale sky, with a large, snow-covered slope occupying the bottom left foreground. The skier travels in an arc from the top left towards the center-right, and as they descend, a distant mountain range becomes visible in the background at the bottom right. The video then hard cuts to a high-angle wide shot from above the skier. The scene is now dark with a blue tint, showing the skier on a steep, shadowy slope that fills the frame.",
