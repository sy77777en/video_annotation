    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, point-of-view perspective, the front half of a blue race car and its driver occupy the foreground in the bottom half of the frame. The driver's helmet is in the bottom center, with their hands on the steering wheel, and the car's nose cone extends towards the center. The front wheels are positioned on the bottom left and bottom right. The asphalt racetrack fills the middle of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground as it curves to the right. In the background, a grassy landscape and rolling hills span the upper portion of the frame, with a cloudy sky positioned at the top. The entire scene moves as the car speeds forward, causing the track and scenery to rush towards the fixed camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a slightly elevated perspective above the driver's head, a driver is seated in the open cockpit of a blue race car. The car, an open-wheel model, features the words \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" in white text on its nose cone, with its front wheels and suspension visible on either side. The driver wears a black helmet that covers their head. Their legs and arms are clad in a white and black patterned racing suit, and their hands are covered by black racing gloves with white and red details, including the \"SPARCO\" brand name.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a camera mounted on a light blue, open-wheel race car shows the vehicle speeding along a paved racetrack during the daytime. The dark asphalt track initially curves to the left, then shifts to a right curve, bordered by a grassy runoff area. In the distance, rolling green hills stretch out beneath a cloudy, overcast sky. The front of the car, marked with a white \"GoPro\" logo, dominates the lower portion of the view, with the driver's gloved hands on the steering wheel and the top of a black helmet visible in the cockpit.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is mounted on the race car, filming the driver from an angle above them, with both the driver and the car roughly half visible, along with a wide shot of the scenery.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
