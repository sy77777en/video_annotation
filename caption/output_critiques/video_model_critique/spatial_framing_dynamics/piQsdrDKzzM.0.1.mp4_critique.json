    "pre_caption": "A medium close-up shot centers on a man in the foreground of a dimly lit parking garage. The ceiling, with its pipes and light fixtures, occupies the top of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the background. In the middle ground and background, concrete pillars and walls define the space, with a barred opening visible in the background on the right. The camera tracks backward, keeping the man centered in the frame as he walks forward, maintaining the medium close-up shot. The camera is positioned at the man's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with medium-length brown hair and a full, neatly trimmed beard is shown from the chest up. He is wearing gold-rimmed aviator sunglasses with dark lenses, a dark t-shirt, and a dark jacket. Initially, he looks to the left of the frame, then shifts his gaze to the right, glances back to the right again, and finally turns his head to the left, maintaining a neutral expression throughout.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit indoor parking garage. The low ceiling is lined with exposed pipes and long, rectangular light fixtures that cast a yellowish glow on the surroundings, though the blurriness in the video creates an illusion of them being fluorescent. The space is defined by concrete support pillars and rough, unfinished concrete walls. In the background, an opening with vertical bars is visible. A man with a beard and sunglasses walks through the garage.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
