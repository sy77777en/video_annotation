    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle wide shot, a group of four motorcycles is initially positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground in a two-by-two formation. Buildings are visible in the background at the top of the frame, with the roof of another building in the immediate foreground at the bottom. A text overlay is fixed in the lower-center foreground. The group of motorcycles moves forward in unison, traveling from the center toward the top of the frame as they enter an intersection. The camera tracks this movement, pulling back slightly to keep the formation centered while revealing more of the road ahead.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From an aerial perspective, four animated police officers are shown riding motorcycles in a rectangular formation on a city street. The officers, two in front and two behind, are all dressed in dark blue uniforms and caps. They are riding identical black motorcycles. A white text box with the word \"SWEEPERS\" in blue is overlaid at the lower-center of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, aerial perspective, a daytime city scene unfolds with a road passing through several four-way intersections. Multi-story buildings with beige and brown facades, red awnings, and multiple windows, as well as buildings with glass facades, line the street. The asphalt road is marked with white dashed lane dividers and a white-striped crosswalk. Four motorcycles, moving in a two-by-two formation, travel along the road and enter another intersection. A text overlay is present in the lower portion of the view, displaying the word \"SWEEPERS\" in blue capital letters inside a white rectangle.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the movement in the latter half of the caption is slightly redundant and contains an explanatory clause (\"since the camera is tracking them\") instead of a purely descriptive one. To improve conciseness and adhere strictly to describing the spatial dynamics, the final two sentences could be combined and rephrased. For example, replace \"The group of motorcycles moves forward in unison, traveling toward the right but always maintaining the center of the frame as they enter an intersection since the camera is tracking them. The camera keeps trucking right to keep the formation centered while revealing more of the road ahead\" with \"The group of motorcycles travels in unison from left to right, remaining centered in the frame as the camera trucks right to track their movement into an intersection.\" This change makes the description of the dynamic movement more direct and streamlined.",
