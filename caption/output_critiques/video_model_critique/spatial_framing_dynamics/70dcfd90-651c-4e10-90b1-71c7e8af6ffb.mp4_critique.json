    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a top-down perspective, a circular basketball court is framed in the center of the scene, occupying the middle ground. Numerous people are scattered throughout the middle ground, with some on the court itself and others positioned along its curved perimeter at the top, left, and bottom of the frame. A partial view of a car is visible in the bottom left foreground, while a wide staircase is located in the bottom right. The camera slowly pulls back throughout the shot, causing the central court to appear slightly smaller within the frame and revealing more of the surrounding dark pavement at the top and bottom edges.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An aerial view captures a uniquely designed circular basketball court with an orange surface and a large, bright blue, three-pointed star at its center. Three key areas, featuring a distinctive combination of rectangular and circular shapes, are spaced evenly around the star, each equipped with a basketball hoop. Numerous people, seen from a distance, are present on and around the court. Some individuals, wearing athletic attire in colors like yellow and white, are actively playing on the court, while others are gathered along its curved perimeter, either standing or sitting. A black car is partially visible on the left side of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a top-down view of a unique, circular outdoor basketball court during the daytime. The court's surface is painted a textured orange color and features a large, bright cyan, three-pointed star at its center. Three purple-painted keys, each with a basketball hoop and standard white line markings, are positioned symmetrically around the central star. The entire circular court is enclosed by a low wall designed with a combination of arcs and straight lines, and is surrounded by dark asphalt pavement, with a road and a wide staircase visible at the edges of the scene. Several people are scattered on the court and along its perimeter. The visual style of the video remains consistent, with no noticeable changes in color saturation or contrast throughout the shot.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the basketball court as being in the \"background\"; in this top-down perspective, the court and the people on it occupy the middle ground. The caption also inaccurately places the car in the \"bottom left\" of the frame, when it is initially in the top left and moves towards the bottom left as the camera rotates. Additionally, the caption fails to explicitly state the shot size at the beginning as required by the instructions. To improve, the description should begin by identifying the shot as a wide shot. It should then correct the court's position to the middle ground and the car's initial position to the top left, adding a brief mention of its movement towards the bottom left to better describe the spatial dynamics caused by the camera's rotation.",
