    "pre_caption": "This is a static full shot where a single green apple occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground. To the left, a partial stack of books also resides in the middle ground. The bottom of the frame is filled with heavily blurred objects in the foreground, while the background contains indistinct shapes and soft, out-of-focus lights. The camera is positioned at the apple's level, and the entire composition remains completely static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A single, bright green apple with one green leaf attached to its stem is positioned in the center of the frame on a dark brown wooden table. To the left of the apple, a small stack of books is partially visible, with the top book having a dark cover. The apple is in sharp focus, while the rest of the scene is blurred.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a single, vibrant green apple with a leaf attached to its stem is positioned in the center of the frame on a dark brown wooden table. The foreground and background are heavily blurred, revealing the indistinct shapes of other objects on the table and furniture in the room. In the midground to the left of the apple, a stack of books is partially visible. In the distant background, soft, out-of-focus lights create a bokeh effect. The overall scene has a muted color palette, with the green apple as the most prominent element.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
