    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, an elderly man is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. A dark, patterned curtain fills the background, while an orange and brown knitted item is visible in the bottom right, situated in the middle ground behind the man's shoulder. A piece of bread moves from the bottom of the frame into the foreground as the man brings it to his mouth in the center. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a close-up shot, an elderly, pale-skinned man with white hair and a thick white mustache faces forward. Blood drips from his mouth, staining his mustache and running down his chin. His eyes are wide and his brow is furrowed. He brings a piece of white bread to his mouth and takes a bite. He is wearing a faintly visible white garment, possibly a vest or short-sleeved shirt. An orange and brown knitted item, likely the cover of the sofa, is visible behind him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, an elderly man is positioned in front of a dark, vertically patterned curtain. An orange and brown knitted blanket is draped over the back of the furniture where he is seated. Blood is visible around the man's mouth as he brings a sandwich made with white bread to his lips to eat.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but has one inaccuracy and one omission. The phrase \"causing the bread to fall out of the frame\" is incorrect; the man actively lowers his hand to move the bread out of the frame, it does not fall. This should be rephrased, for example, to \"the man lowers his hand, moving the bread out of the frame.\" Additionally, the caption omits the prominent detail of blood on the man's mouth and mustache, which is located in the center of the frame. This is a key visual element of the subject that should be included for a more complete description.",
