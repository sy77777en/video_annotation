    "pre_caption": "In a wide, top-down shot, one person lies stationary in the center of the frame on a paved surface, serving as the main subject. In the middle ground, two other people move in a clockwise circle around the central figure. One individual, starting in the top left quadrant, runs along the circular path, while the other, initially in the bottom left, spins while also moving clockwise. The camera itself rotates clockwise, causing the entire scene, including the moving figures and the surrounding paved area marked with a dashed circle, to spin around the static central subject. A thin, dark line is visible crossing the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a top-down perspective, a person lies on their back in the center of the scene, serving as the main subject. This individual has their hands behind their head and legs crossed, wearing a dark top with red and white embellishments on one side at the front, light blue shorts with yellow fabric visible above them, and black boots. Two other people move around the central figure: one is dressed in a black top and bright green trousers, running with arms outstretched while waving a rainbow-colored, wing-shaped fabric prop; the other is wearing a white top, a light blue skirt, white shoes, and a bright red beret, and is spinning around.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a rotating, top-down perspective, the scene captures an outdoor paved area during the day. The gray asphalt surface is cracked and marked with a large circle composed of dashed white lines. A thin dark line, possibly a cable or shadow, initially crosses near the top of the frame. As the camera continues to rotate, creating a spinning effect and motion blur along the outer edges, the position of the dark line shifts from the top to the sides and eventually returns to its initial position. Within the circle, one person lies on the ground near the center while two others move around them. The figures cast visible shadows on the pavement.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the shot type, camera movement, and the actions of the central and spinning figures. However, the description of the second person's movement as \"walks back and forth across the frame\" is inaccurate. This person is moving in a circular path around the central figure, not in a linear back-and-forth motion. This should be corrected to \"walks in a circular path around the central figure\". Additionally, for conciseness, the interpretive phrase \"serving as the main subject\" can be removed, and the redundant clause \"rather than traveling around the circle\" can be deleted since \"spinning in place\" already conveys this information.",
