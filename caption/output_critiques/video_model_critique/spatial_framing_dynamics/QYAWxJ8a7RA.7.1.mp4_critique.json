    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, wide shot of a landscape from a low-angle perspective. A massive pile of silver, granular tailings occupies the foreground and midground, starting from the bottom of the frame and sloping up towards the center-right. In the background, tall, light-brown canyon walls are visible on the left and right sides of the frame. A text overlay is positioned in the bottom left corner of the foreground. The camera is positioned low to the ground, looking up at the pile of tailings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a landscape scenery shot from a low-angle perspective, looking up at a massive, silver pile of glittering, granular tailings. The mound fills the foreground and extends to the midground, its surface sparkling under sunlight, creating a stark contrast against the towering, sandy-brown canyon walls in the background. There is no single main subject, as the composition is designed to convey a sense of immense scale and the overwhelming presence of the industrial waste within the natural environment. The focus is on the atmosphere and the relationship between the man-made and the natural rather than a specific, discrete object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting during the day, a massive pile of silver, granular, and reflective material sits at the base of a canyon. The pile's surface glitters in the sunlight, which casts a large shadow across its slope. Flanking the pile are tall, light-brown rock formations with textured surfaces. In the bottom left corner, a white text overlay on a light-colored rectangle reads, \"30,000,000 t of tailings,\" with another overlay below displaying \"[10,29].\" Both overlays disappear later in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

Additionally, the description of the camera's perspective is redundant; it is mentioned as a \"low-angle perspective\" at the beginning and again as \"The camera is positioned low to the ground\" at the end. These two statements should be consolidated for conciseness.",
