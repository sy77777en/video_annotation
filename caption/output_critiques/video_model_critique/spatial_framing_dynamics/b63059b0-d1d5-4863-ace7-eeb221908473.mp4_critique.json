    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot begins with a blurry view of a man positioned in the left and central foreground. The shot then racks focus, bringing the man into sharp view while he remains in the left half of the frame. In the background, a wall displaying rows of framed pictures becomes visible, occupying the right side of the scene. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young adult man with blonde hair and a matching short beard is shown from the chest up. He wears black-rimmed glasses, a dark blue baseball cap, and a dark jacket over a light-colored t-shirt. He is smiling while looking toward his left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene, presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom, is characterized by warm, soft lighting. The shot transitions from a soft blur into focus, revealing a man wearing a baseball cap and glasses in the foreground. In the background, a wall displays several rows of picture frames showcasing images. The overall environment has a warm, neutral color palette.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the shot size, the rack focus, the subject's position, the background elements, and the camera height. However, the description of the subject's position as \"left and central\" is slightly awkward; using \"left-center\" or stating he occupies the \"left half\" of the frame would be more standard and concise. Additionally, the caption describes the background becoming visible in a separate sentence from the rack focus that causes it. The description could be improved for better flow by linking these two events more directly, for example: \"The shot then racks focus, bringing the man into sharp view... and revealing a background wall...\".",
