    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. Behind him, a horizontal bar stretches across the middle ground, with walls and a door visible in the background. A small ring of fire briefly materializes and vanishes in the middle ground above the man's right hand. The camera then executes a slow clockwise pan around the man, causing the background to shift from right to left. During this movement, a larger, spinning ring of fire appears in the middle ground to the man's left, on the right side of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with a bald head, reddish-blond hair on the sides, and a matching beard and mustache is sitting and facing forward with his eyes tightly closed. He wears a light-colored, long-sleeved, patterned button-up shirt. His hands are held out in front of him with the palms facing up. At the beginning of the video, a red ring of fire is suspended in the air above his right hand but quickly vanishes. As the camera moves in a clockwise direction, a new rotating ring of fire, made up of orange and yellow flames, appears in the air in front of him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit, bare room with light-colored walls. A horizontal bar runs across the middle of the back wall, where a closed door is also visible. A man in a light-colored shirt is seated in the center of the room. In front of him, a bright, orange-yellow ring of fire materializes and spins in the air, leaving a trail of light. The entire video is presented with black bars on the left and right sides, creating a vertical frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

It should be corrected to describe its position within the frame, such as \"at the center-right of the frame.\" Additionally, the term \"clockwise pan\" should be changed to \"clockwise arc\" to more accurately describe the camera's movement through space around the subject, which is consistent with the later use of the word \"arc.\"",
