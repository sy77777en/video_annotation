    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot of a college football stadium, captured from a high-angle perspective above the crowd. The shot lacks a single main subject, instead focusing on the overall atmosphere and scale of the event. Initially, the frame is centered on the right side of the stadium, with the backs of spectators in the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame. The middle ground is dominated by the football field, with the \"WILDCATS\" end zone on the right, and the packed stands on the far side. A distinctive tan building is visible in the top right background, beyond the stands. The camera then performs a slow, continuous pan from right to left, gradually revealing the entire length of the field and the opposite side of the stadium. The pan concludes with the left side of the stadium in view, showing a large scoreboard and an inflatable tunnel in the top left middle ground, and the \"NORTHWESTERN\" end zone on the field below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a panoramic scenery shot of a bustling college football stadium during a game. The video lacks a single main subject, as the camera's wide, sweeping view is intended to capture the immense scale of the event and the energetic atmosphere of the crowd rather than focusing on an individual person or action. The camera pans slowly from right to left, revealing the full expanse of the venue under a cloudy sky. The stands are densely packed with thousands of spectators, many wearing purple, creating a vibrant tapestry of fans. Below, on the bright green football field marked with the \"WILDCATS\" and \"NORTHWESTERN\" team names, players in white and dark uniforms are positioned for a play. In the background, a line of green trees separates the stadium from distant buildings, and a large video scoreboard is visible at the far end of the field.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A panoramic view from the upper stands of a crowded American football stadium, Ryan Field, unfolds during a game. The green turf is marked with \"WILDCATS\" and \"NORTHWESTERN\" in the end zones, along with the \"BIG\" conference logo at midfield. The stands are packed with spectators, many dressed in purple. The camera pans slowly from right to left, revealing the full scope of the venue. On the far side of the field, a large scoreboard displays game information next to a purple inflatable wildcat tunnel. A distinctive tan building with a turret-like structure rises behind the stands on the right. The sky is overcast, and the bright stadium lights are illuminated. Football players are scattered across the field during a break in the action.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the camera's height as a \"level angle above the crowd.\" The shot is clearly taken from a high vantage point looking down, which is a high-angle shot, not a level one. This should be corrected to \"from a high angle.\" Additionally, the phrase \"instead focusing on the overall atmosphere and scale of the event\" is interpretive and should be removed to maintain a strictly descriptive tone. Finally, for greater accuracy, the position of the scoreboard and inflatable tunnel should be described as being in the \"left middle ground\" rather than the \"top left middle ground.\"",
