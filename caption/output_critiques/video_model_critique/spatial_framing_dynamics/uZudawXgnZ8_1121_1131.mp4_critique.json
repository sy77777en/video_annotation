    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot, filmed from a high-angle, top-down perspective, initially places a player character in the center-left middle ground of a forest clearing. The character moves within the central area, clearing debris by moving slightly up, down, and then toward the center of the frame. The clearing itself, located in the center and upper-center, is surrounded by dense trees that occupy the left, right, and bottom portions of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. Rocks, logs, and weeds are scattered across the middle ground clearing, and a portion of a building is visible in the top-center background. Static interface elements include a toolbar at the bottom, an information panel in the top right, and an item box in the bottom left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixelated, top-down view of a video game, a character with gray hair, a red shirt, and blue pants wields an axe. The character is shown chopping at green, leafy weeds and a brown wooden log, which break apart into collectible items like wood, sap, and fiber. The surrounding area is populated with various types of trees, including green, round-topped deciduous trees, darker green, conical pine trees, and a couple of trees with vibrant pink and purple blossoms. Also scattered across the green grass and orange-brown patches of dirt are small, gray, rounded rocks, brown wooden logs, and tree stumps.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows a rural, outdoor scene in a pixel art style. The environment is a clearing in a forest, with a patch of light brown dirt surrounded by vibrant green grass. The area is populated with a mix of dark green, conical pine trees and lighter green, rounded deciduous trees, some of which have pink blossoms. The ground is cluttered with gray stones, fallen logs, tree stumps, and small green weeds. A character with gray hair and red clothing moves through the area, swinging an axe to clear the debris. In the latter part of the video, a small wooden building becomes partially visible in the upper portion of the scene. Overlays are present on the screen: in the top right corner, a display shows a sun icon, the date \"Mon. 1,\" the time advancing from morning, and an exclamation mark icon next to the number 500. At the bottom center of the screen is a toolbar with icons for various tools. In the bottom left, temporary small boxes display collected items like \"Wood,\" \"Sap,\" and \"Fiber.\" In the bottom right, there is a narrow bar with an \"E\" on top.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",

The description of the interface elements as \"static\" is inaccurate, as the item boxes in the bottom left appear and disappear dynamically. The term \"tracks\" to describe the camera's movement is vague; it should be specified that the camera \"pans\" to follow the character. Finally, the phrase \"initially around the corner of the clearing\" is unclear and should be removed for better conciseness.",

In the foreground, interface elements are layered over the game world, including a toolbar at the bottom and an information panel in the top right. In the bottom left, item boxes appear dynamically as the character collects resources. The middle ground contains the main gameplay area: a forest clearing surrounded by dense trees. The clearing is scattered with rocks, logs, and weeds, and a portion of a building is visible in the top-center background. A player character, starting in the center-left, moves around the central area, clearing weeds. The camera pans to follow the character, keeping them near the center of the frame.",
