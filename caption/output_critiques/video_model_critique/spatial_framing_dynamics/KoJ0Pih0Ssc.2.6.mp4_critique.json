    "pre_caption": "This static wide shot frames two glowing humanoid figures in the center of the frame. They are positioned in the middle ground, standing inside an open window of a dark building facade that occupies the entire background. To their left and right, other bricked-in windows are also situated in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black-and-white scene, two glowing, white, featureless humanoid figures stand side-by-side within an open window. They possess the general shape of human bodies but lack any discernible details such as faces, hair, or clothing. The figure on the left is positioned with its body slightly turned toward its own left side, while the figure on the right stands next to it, facing forward. Both figures are static and emit a bright, white light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a monochromatic nighttime scene, the facade of a dark, multi-story building is shown. The building features decorative moldings above its windows. While most windows are dark and appear to be bricked in, a single window on an upper floor is open. Within this open window, two humanoid figures stand, their forms outlined by a bright white glow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is largely accurate but could be more concise and fluid. The phrase \"frames two glowing humanoid figures in the center of the frame\" is slightly redundant. Additionally, the description of the facade and the other windows is split into two sentences and could be combined for better flow. Consider revising to something like: \"This wide shot centers on two glowing humanoid figures positioned in the middle ground within an open window. The dark building facade, including adjacent bricked-in windows, occupies the foreground, while the interior wall behind the figures forms the background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.\"",
