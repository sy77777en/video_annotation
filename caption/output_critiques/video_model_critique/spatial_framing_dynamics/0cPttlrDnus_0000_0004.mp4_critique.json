    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide scenery shot presents a static, aerial view of a cityscape. A large, mirrored building occupies the foreground on the right side of the frame. In the middle ground, a collection of other buildings is visible in the center and to the left, situated on a cliff edge. The background is composed of a sprawling city that extends to hazy mountains on the horizon. A graphic overlay of connected points is superimposed over the entire scene. The camera is positioned at a high altitude, maintaining a level-angle perspective relative to the top of the foreground building.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an aerial cityscape scenery shot that captures a sprawling urban landscape under a hazy sky. A prominent, modern building with a highly reflective, mirrored facade stands in the foreground, distorting the reflection of the surrounding city. In the distance, numerous high-rise buildings and residential areas extend towards rolling hills and mountains on the horizon, with a faint graphic overlay of connected lines and logos superimposed on the scene. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the expansive scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than to focus on a particular object or individual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a level-angle perspective of a sprawling cityscape under a hazy sky. In the foreground, a large, cube-shaped building with a highly reflective, mirrored glass facade captures a distorted reflection of the urban landscape. In the midground and background, the city, composed of various high-rise and residential buildings, stretches into the distance, eventually meeting hazy mountains on the horizon. Overlaying the entire scene is a digital network of thin white lines connecting several small, white 'M'-shaped logos, with one column of the 'M' replaced by a green arrow.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is largely accurate but could be more precise in two areas. First, the description of the middle ground elements as \"a collection of other buildings\" should be changed to \"four buildings\" for greater specificity. Second, the description of the graphic overlay as \"connected points\" is slightly generic; it should be revised to \"lines connecting small logos\" to more accurately describe the visible graphic.",
