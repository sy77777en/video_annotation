    "pre_caption": "The shot is a full shot of a pink water balloon positioned in the center-left foreground on a grey stone paver, which itself rests on a green stool at the bottom of the frame. On the right side of the frame, a person's leg is visible in the middle ground, with a green lawn filling the middle ground and a wooden fence in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. A yellow-green tennis ball enters from the top right, moving towards the balloon. A tennis racket, held by the person, appears on the right and strikes the ball. The ball travels from the middle ground to the foreground, colliding with the balloon. The balloon deforms and stretches, momentarily enveloping the ball in the center-left foreground. The ball then rebounds, moving from the center-left back towards the top right and exiting the frame. Subsequently, the crumpled pink balloon falls from the paver, moving from the center-left towards the bottom left of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A round, pink water balloon rests on a circular grey stone paver. To the right, the leg of a person wearing light-colored shorts is visible. The person swings a black and yellow tennis racket, striking a yellow-green tennis ball. The ball flies into the water balloon, causing the balloon to deform and stretch, momentarily enveloping the ball without popping. The tennis ball then bounces back out, and the now-crumpled pink balloon falls off the paver.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunny backyard with a green lawn and a wooden fence, a pink balloon sits on a round, grey paving stone atop a green plastic stool. A yellow tennis ball, struck by a tennis racket held by a person partially visible on the right, flies toward the balloon. The video, in slow motion, captures the ball hitting the balloon, causing the pink rubber to stretch and briefly envelop the ball before it rebounds and moves to the right. Subsequently, the now-deformed balloon falls off the stone paver to the left.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera focuses on the water balloon in the foreground, with part of the person's leg is visible on the right side of the frame. Then, a tennis ball shows up on the right of the balloon, hit by a racket, causing the ball to hit the water balloon, making the water balloon deform and fall off the platform, while the tennis ball bounces out of the frame. Overall, this shot is considered a full shot of the water balloon.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The term \"full shot\" is inaccurate for the given framing; it should be corrected to \"medium shot,\" as the shot focuses on the action setup and only a part of the person. The description of the person's leg being in the \"middle ground\" is also incorrect; it is positioned in the right foreground. The caption states the ball \"enters from the top right, moving towards the balloon,\" but the video shows the ball falling from the top of the frame before a racket enters from the right to strike it. This sequence of actions should be described more accurately. Finally, the phrase \"in the center-left foreground\" is used redundantly to describe the balloon's deformation; since the balloon's position is already established, this repetition should be removed for conciseness.",
