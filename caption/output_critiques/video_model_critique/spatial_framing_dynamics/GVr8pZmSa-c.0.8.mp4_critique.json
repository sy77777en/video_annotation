    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a shot focused on a bronze, hand-shaped object positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, viewed from above. A dark, blurry surface occupies the rest of the middle ground and background. Subsequently, the out-of-focus lower legs and feet of a person enter from the top left, settling into the left foreground of the scene. As the person's legs become more prominent, the camera's perspective lowers to become level with the hand. The final framing shows the person's legs on the left in the foreground, the hand in the center middle ground, and a dark expanse with distant hills and small white lights in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video focuses on a greenish, corroded bronze object shaped like a hand, which is positioned in the center of the frame as if reaching up from a medium gray surface with five fingers extended. Subsequently, the out-of-focus lower legs and feet of a person wearing dark pants and heavy boots enter the scene from the top left corner, while the hand remains the primary subject of focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit underwater scene, a corroded, greenish-bronze hand emerges from the sandy mud on the seabed, casting a distinct shadow below. The hand is positioned in the center of the scene, reaching upward. In the foreground, the silhouette of a person's lower leg and boot is visible on the left. The background consists of a deep blue expanse with small hills, where white spots flash intermittently.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an underwater scene, with a hand-shaped object in focus on the seabed in the center of the frame. Then, the blurred feet of a person enter from the top left of the frame, gradually revealing part of their lower legs.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption inaccurately describes the final scene's background and the number of limbs visible. The \"scattered small white lights\" are stars in the sky, located only in the background, not throughout the foreground and middle ground. The caption also repeatedly refers to \"legs and feet\" in the plural, when only one leg and foot are clearly visible. Additionally, the camera's final position is still slightly above the hand, not perfectly \"level\" with it. The initial blurry shape at the top left, which resolves into the person's leg, is also omitted.\n\nHere is a more accurate version:\nThe video opens with a high-angle shot focused on a bronze hand in the center-middle ground, emerging from a dark, cloud-like surface. A dark, out-of-focus shape at the top left moves down, resolving into the lower leg and foot of a person that settles in the left foreground. As this occurs, the camera's angle lowers, revealing a dark sky with scattered white lights and distant hills in the background. The final framing shows the person's leg in the left foreground, the hand in the center-middle ground, and the starry sky in the background, with the camera positioned at a slightly high angle relative to the hand.",
