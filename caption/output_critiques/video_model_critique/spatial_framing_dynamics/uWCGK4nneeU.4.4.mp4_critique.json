    "pre_caption": "In a low-angle full shot, a large, modified aircraft is positioned in the center of the frame, flying in the middle ground against a clear blue sky in the background. The camera tracks the aircraft as it moves forward, ascending to match its altitude. The shot transitions to a level-angle perspective, with the aircraft remaining centrally framed in a full shot, now flying horizontally across the middle ground with scattered clouds visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, modified aircraft is shown in flight, initially from a low-angle perspective and then from a level-angle perspective. The plane has a white fuselage with a red top and a red vertical section on its T-shaped tail. It features long, straight wings with numerous small, white, spinning propellers along the underside of each wing. The aircraft's landing gear is extended, showing multiple wheels. The most prominent feature is a massive, bulbous, light-colored structure attached to the rear of the fuselage, encased in a dark, cage-like framework of wires or rods. This structure is significantly wider than the plane's main body and tapers towards the back.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a large, multi-propeller aircraft in flight against a clear blue sky with a few scattered white clouds. The aircraft has a white and red fuselage, with numerous small, spinning propellers lining the leading edge of its long wings. The landing gear is extended. A prominent feature is a large, bulbous, cage-like structure that encases the rear portion of the fuselage.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the aircraft as being \"positioned in the center of the frame\" at the start; it actually moves from the bottom of the frame toward the upper right. The statement \"creating an illusion of upward motion, though the actual movement is ambiguous\" is speculative and inaccurate; the aircraft is clearly shown moving upward and across the frame. The phrase \"The shot transitions\" is misleading, as the change in perspective occurs within a single, continuous shot due to camera movement, not a cut or dissolve. Finally, describing the background as containing \"visible mountainous terrain\" is an uncertain interpretation; it is more accurately described as a hazy horizon with clouds.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a low angle, a large, modified aircraft is seen in a full shot as it flies diagonally upward from the bottom of the frame toward the upper right. The camera tilts up and pans to track the aircraft against a clear blue sky. As the camera movement continues, the perspective shifts to a more level angle, and the aircraft flies horizontally across the middle ground, with scattered clouds now visible in the background.",
