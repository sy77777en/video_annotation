    "pre_caption": "In a full shot from a high angle, a light blue pillar-like structure is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground against a dark, gridded background. In the background, a pink line extends diagonally from the bottom left, and a light green line extends from the bottom right, both positioned behind the central structure. Numerous transparent fragments fly inward from all directions of the frame, converging on the central pillar to form a swirling ring around its midsection.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A central, pillar-like structure features a smooth, translucent, light blue cylinder positioned vertically between two circular, light blue platforms, one above and one below. Numerous transparent fragments appear to gather around the cylinder, while two thin diagonal lines, one pink and one light green, are also visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an abstract, dark space marked by a white grid, a smooth, light blue cylinder stands on a light blue circular base and is topped with a matching circular cap. A thin pink line and a thin lime green line cross diagonally in the background. Numerous sharp, gray fragments appearing from all directions and flying inwards to encircle the still-intact central column.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

The caption states they extend \"from the middle of the bottom edge,\" but the video shows them originating from the circular base of the central pillar.
