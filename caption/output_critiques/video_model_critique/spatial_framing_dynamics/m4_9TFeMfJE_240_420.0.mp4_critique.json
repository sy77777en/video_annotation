    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a person is seated in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, behind a desk that extends from the foreground. A banker's lamp is positioned in the middle ground to the right, with a rotary telephone further to its right. The background is a wall marked by horizontal shadows. Initially, the person is in profile with their hand on the lamp; they then withdraw their hand downwards while turning their head to face the camera, remaining in their central position. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a high-contrast, black-and-white scene, a person who appears to be a woman is seated at a desk. Her visible skin, including her face, neck, and arms, is completely covered in a dark, glistening, liquid-like substance. She has short, dark, coiffed hair that is also wet and shiny. Initially seen in profile, she turns her head to face forward, revealing wide eyes. Her hand is near the base of a banker's lamp on the desk, before she withdraws her hand down the desk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, monochromatic office, a reflective wooden desk extends from the foreground to the midground. The primary light source is the light filtering through a set of Venetian blinds, creating stark horizontal shadows on the wall behind a seated figure. A classic banker's lamp with a metal base sits on the desk, though it is not turned on. The figure, whose skin and hair appear to be covered in a dark and wet substance, is mostly in silhouette. On the desk, a vintage rotary telephone is visible on the right. The entire scene has a vintage film quality, with visible grain and light scratches.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the person's movement as \"shifting slightly to the center-left.\" The person does not move their position within the frame; they rotate their upper body and head from a profile view to face the camera. This part of the description should be corrected to simply state that the person \"turns their head to face the camera.\" Additionally, the caption omits a statuette positioned in the left foreground on the desk.",
