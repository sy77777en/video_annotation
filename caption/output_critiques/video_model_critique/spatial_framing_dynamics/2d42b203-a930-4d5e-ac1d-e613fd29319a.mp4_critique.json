    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a camera positioned at the subject's level, showing a red car in the center background on a dark road. The road extends from the foreground to the background, with a solid white line running from the bottom left towards the center. As the camera moves forward, the red car approaches, moving from the background to the middle ground while remaining in the center of the frame. This movement causes the framing to transition into a full shot of the car, which now occupies a larger portion of the central frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A red, small hatchback car is seen from behind on a dark road at night. Its red taillights are illuminated. As the car gets closer, its license plate, which reads \"6N4 6583\", becomes visible. A circular logo, consistent with that of a Fiat, is centered on the rear of the vehicle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera, capturing the scene ahead, a vehicle travels along a dark, paved road at night. The road is marked by a solid white line, and the surrounding area is pitch black, with green grass visible on both sides of the road in the glow of the headlights. A red hatchback with illuminated taillights drives in front, moving along the same path.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a factual error regarding the subject's depth. It incorrectly states the red car is \"consistently in the midground.\" In the video, the car is initially in the background and moves into the midground as the camera approaches. To correct this, remove the word \"consistently\" and change the description to reflect this transition. For instance, describe the car as being \"initially in the background\" and then note that as the camera moves forward, the car \"transitions from the background to the midground.\"",
