    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot from a low angle, showing a skier emerging from a group of evergreen trees in the top-center middle ground. As the skier moves down the slope toward the camera, the framing transitions to a full shot, positioning the skier in the central foreground, with the sun visible in the top-left background. The camera's perspective then changes to a high-angle view from above the subject. The shot simultaneously widens again as the skier moves away from the camera, becoming a smaller figure in the central middle ground. The final frame is a wide shot where the foreground is dominated by the snowy slope, the skier is in the middle ground, and the forest lines the background on the left and top.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man skiing down a snowy mountain. He is wearing a dark, long-sleeved jacket paired with bright orange ski pants and bright orange gloves. On his back, he carries a black backpack with a red zipper. He uses black ski poles to navigate the slope, and both of his skis have red undersides. Throughout the video, he is seen from the back and side, leaning into turns and kicking up large plumes of white powder snow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds on a vast, snow-covered mountain under a clear, bright blue sky on a sunny day. The slope, covered in deep, white powder, is flanked by tall, snow-dusted evergreen trees that span from the upper-left corner to the upper-middle-right area of the frame. In the background, distant snow-capped peaks are visible. The bright sun casts long, dark shadows across the snow, which dominates the frame, extending from the foreground to the background. A skier, centrally positioned in the midground, descends the mountain, carving turns and kicking up a large spray of white snow, leaving fresh tracks on the slope.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera follows a skier as he moves down the slope, with the shot size changing from a wide shot to a full shot, and then back to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject and then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the entire segment from approximately 00:02 to 00:03, where the camera, from a low angle, follows the skier moving away into the middle ground while kicking up a large cloud of snow. The description of the camera's perspective changing to a high-angle view is correct for the shot at 00:03, but it incorrectly implies this happens immediately after the skier passes the camera at 00:01. Additionally, the description of the sun \"before it exits the frame\" is confusing and should be removed for clarity. The final sentence is redundant, as it describes the same final shot as the preceding sentence; these should be combined into a single, concise description of the final high-angle wide shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video starts with a wide shot from a low angle, showing a skier emerging from a group of evergreen trees in the top-center middle ground. As the skier moves down the slope, they pass close to the camera in a full shot, with the sun flaring in the top-left background. The low-angle camera then follows the skier as they carve a turn away from the lens, kicking up a large cloud of powder snow. The perspective then cuts to a high-angle wide shot from above, showing the skier continuing down the mountain, now a smaller figure in the middle ground with their tracks visible on the snowy slope.",
