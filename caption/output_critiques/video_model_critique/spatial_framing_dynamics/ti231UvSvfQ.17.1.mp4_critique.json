    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot, a white mug is positioned in the left foreground on a white surface. The surface occupies the bottom of the frame and extends into the middle ground, while the background consists of an out-of-focus white plane. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the composition remains unchanged throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A tall, white ceramic mug stands upright on a light-colored surface. The mug features a tiered design, with the upper section being a wider cylinder and the lower section a narrower frustum. The transition between these shapes is seamless, creating a concave-convex texture. A simple, C-shaped handle is attached to the left side of the upper portion. The mug is a uniform white color with a smooth finish and no visible markings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a minimalist indoor setting, a single white, stackable mug is positioned on the left side of a slightly tilted plain white surface. The ceramic mug features an upper cylindrical section transitioning smoothly into a lower frustum, creating a concave-convex texture. It has a simple C-shaped handle. The background is a matching, out-of-focus white plane, creating a monochromatic and clean composition under soft, even lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the shot size as a \"full shot\" when it is a close-up shot of the mug. The statement that the mug is \"initially partially visible\" is also inaccurate; the mug is fully visible from the beginning, positioned on the left side of the frame. Furthermore, the phrase \"eventually revealing a full view of the cup\" is misleading, as the cup is already in full view. The description should be corrected to state that in a static close-up shot, a white mug, initially in the left foreground, slides horizontally to the right side of the frame.",
