    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame, starting in the middle ground and walking toward the foreground along a path. The scene is framed by the underside of an elevated train track structure that occupies the top half of the frame, with its support columns receding from the foreground into the background to create strong leading lines. A large brick building is located on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, while trees and a fence are visible on the right side, also in the middle ground. The text \"ROAD TO PERDITION (2002)\" is overlaid in the bottom-left foreground. As the man moves forward, he remains centrally positioned. The camera is static and positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man is seen from a distance walking toward the viewer down a wet, unpaved path. He is dressed in a long, dark overcoat and a dark fedora. In his right hand, he carries a dark, rectangular briefcase, and in his left hand, he holds a camera. He is positioned centrally, walking toward the camera underneath the repeating support structure of an elevated train track.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a wet, paved path beneath a massive, elevated train track structure. On the left stands a large, dark brick building. The tracks above are supported by a long, repeating series of light-colored, riveted steel columns resting on concrete bases, creating a covered corridor that recedes into a hazy background. To the right of the path, beyond the columns, are green trees and a fence. The ground is uneven with puddles, suggesting an overcast day. A lone figure in a dark coat and hat walks toward the camera down the center of the walkway. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text \"ROAD TO PERDITION (2002)\" in white.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the camera movement is inaccurate. The caption states, \"the camera moves forward while simultaneously zooming out,\" which describes a dolly zoom or \"Vertigo effect.\" In the video, the camera does move forward, but it does not zoom out. This is evident because the subject, the man, grows progressively larger in the frame as he walks toward the camera. If the camera were also zooming out, his size relative to the frame would either remain constant or decrease, and the background perspective would appear to expand, neither of which occurs. The final sentence should be corrected to accurately describe the camera's forward tracking movement. For example, it should be changed to: \"As the man walks toward the camera, the camera also moves forward slowly.\"",
