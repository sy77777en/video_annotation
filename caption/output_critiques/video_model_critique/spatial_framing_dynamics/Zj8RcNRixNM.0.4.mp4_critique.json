    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a central silhouetted figure occupies the middle ground, positioned between two other silhouetted individuals on the left and right. In the foreground and extending into the middle ground, other people are seated at computer monitors on both the left and right sides of the frame. Large screens are visible in the central background. The camera slowly moves forward through the central aisle, pushing in from the foreground toward the middle ground, which causes the central figures to become more prominent in the frame. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a person seen from the back in silhouette, standing in the center of a dark, crowded room. To their right and in front of them, another individual is leading them, while two other individuals are also standing in silhouette to their left and in front of them, all facing a large screen at the front. The room is filled with other silhouetted figures, most of whom are seated at desks with computer monitors. The primary light source comes from these screens. A large central screen, labeled \"AUSTRALIA,\" displays a close-up of a man with dark hair and a beard, wearing a white shirt. To the right of this main display and on the desks are numerous smaller screens showing video calls with various people, identified by indistinct labels.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit, temporary command center, characterized by its dark, fabric-like walls and ceiling. The space is filled with rows of workstations, each equipped with a computer monitor, and is illuminated primarily by the blue-white glow of the screens and long, overhead fluorescent lights. At the far end of the room, larger screens are mounted on a wall. Both the individual monitors and the larger displays show a grid of live video feeds, featuring various individuals. White text is visible on some screens, identifying the feeds with country names such as \"AUSTRALIA,\" \"UK,\" and \"VENEZUELA.\" Numerous silhouetted figures occupy the room; some are seated at the computers, while others stand observing the screens as the viewpoint moves slowly forward through a central aisle.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the shot size as a medium close-up; it is a medium shot, as it establishes the environment around the subjects. The description of the subjects' positions and movements contains several inaccuracies. The central figure is in the middle ground, not the foreground. The statement that this figure approaches \"two other silhouetted individuals on the left\" is incorrect; they approach two individuals in the center. The claim that \"one of these individuals moves out of view from the far left\" is not supported by the video. The description of the seated people is confusing; they are in the foreground and middle ground, and as the camera moves forward, they pass by and exit from the bottom and sides of the frame, not \"extend into the middle ground before all exit.\" Finally, the camera does not maintain a certain distance; it is a tracking shot that follows the subjects as they move deeper into the scene. The description should be revised to state that a medium shot follows a central silhouetted figure in the middle ground as they walk forward, with the camera dollying behind them, causing seated people in the foreground to pass out of frame. The central figure then stops in the middle ground with other figures, all facing screens in the background.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dimly lit command center, a medium shot follows a central silhouetted figure walking forward down an aisle. The camera dollies behind them at subject level. On either side, other figures are seated at desks with computer monitors. As the camera moves forward, these seated people in the foreground and middle ground pass by and exit the frame. The central figure stops in the middle ground, joining two other silhouetted figures who are standing and facing large screens on the back wall, which display various video feeds.",
