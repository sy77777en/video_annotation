    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of an elephant occupying the left and center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. A green, thorny bush sits in the immediate foreground on the bottom left, partially obscuring the elephant's lower body. The middle ground and background are composed of tall, dry grass and dense bushes that stretch across the scene to the right. The elephant then turns its head to its left, moving its trunk across the frame to interact with the middle-ground vegetation on the right. This action shifts the composition, with the elephant's head now shown in profile on the right side of the frame, while the shot remains a medium shot. Throughout the clip, the camera is positioned at the elephant's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a single African bush elephant with grey-brown, wrinkled skin. The elephant has large, floppy ears and two white tusks, with the one on its left side being more prominent. Initially, the elephant is seen from the feet up, facing mostly forward and looking slightly toward the right of the frame. It then turns its head further to its left, showing its right profile to the camera as it interacts with the surrounding vegetation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting, a vast expanse of dry savanna is covered in tall, pale grass and dense, thorny bushes with green leaves. The warm, soft lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon. A large elephant with visible white tusks occasionally steps forward while turning its head to forage in the brush, partially obscured by the vegetation.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of an elephant. It then transitions to a full shot as the elephant turns toward the camera. After turning back, the video returns to a medium shot of the elephant.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The initial shot size is a medium-long shot, not a full shot, as the elephant's lower legs and feet are not visible. The description of the elephant's movement and the camera's reaction could be more precise. The caption states the camera pans but omits the direction. The elephant turns its head to its left (the viewer's right) and moves forward, and the camera pans right to follow it. The phrase \"allowing the elephant's rear side to move out of the frame\" is slightly awkward; it would be clearer to state that as the camera follows the elephant's head, its rear moves toward the left edge of the frame.",
