    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot captured at the subjects' level, the scene opens with the main subject, a man in a pink shirt, positioned on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, standing behind a seated colleague. A large green filing cabinet occupies the right foreground. The man begins to push the cabinet from left to right, and the camera pans horizontally to follow his movement. As he and the cabinet traverse the scene, the initial cubicle on the left moves out of frame, while an identical cubicle with another seated man is revealed on the right in the middle ground. Throughout the pan, the filing cabinet remains in the foreground and the man pushing it stays in the middle ground, serving as the consistent moving focus of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of this animated video is a tall, thin man with a long face, black hair parted on the side, and white glasses. He is wearing a pink long-sleeved button-up shirt, a dark tie, and dark purple pants. He stands and pushes a large, green filing cabinet or cart, which has a yellow envelope symbol on its front, through an office environment. The office is populated by other men who are identical in appearance, all with black hair and wearing the same pink shirts. These men are seated in green office chairs at their desks, viewed from behind, each holding a white mug. They are focused on their computer monitors, which display an animation of a figure pushing a large boulder up a hill. The desks also feature other recurring items, including calendars with images of people in suggestive poses, clocks with a man's figure whose arms act as the hands, and a framed photo of a man in a pink shirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a monotonous, animated office environment characterized by a series of identical green cubicles under flat, even lighting. The perspective moves to the right, following a man as he pushes a large green filing cabinet, revealing a seemingly endless row of identical workstations. Each desk is furnished with a computer, a clock on the wall indicating 8:09, a pin-up calendar, and a framed photograph. The computer monitors at each station display a looping animation of a figure pushing a large, round boulder up a steep incline. The overall color scheme consists of muted greens, pinks, and purples.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The initial spatial description should be clarified: the man is in the left middle ground, standing behind the seated colleague, while the filing cabinet is in the right foreground. Consequently, in the final sentence, the description of the man's position during the movement is inaccurate; he remains in the middle ground, not the foreground, as he pushes the cabinet which stays in the foreground.",
