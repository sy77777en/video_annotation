    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot with no main subject. The bottom half of the frame is occupied by a dark body of water in the foreground, with green shrubs visible in the bottom right. In the middle ground, a horizontal line of dense green trees and reeds borders the water. A large, multi-story apartment building is positioned centrally in the background, filling the upper portion of the frame, partially obscured by the trees. The camera is positioned at a low angle from across the water and remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot featuring a massive, multi-story apartment building set behind a tranquil body of water. The long, uniform structure, with its countless balconies, stretches across the background under a flat, overcast sky. Lush green trees and dense foliage frame the building and line the banks of the dark, rippling water in the foreground. There is no main subject, as the composition emphasizes the scale of the man-made structure in contrast with the surrounding natural environment. The focus is on establishing a specific place and a quiet, slightly somber atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on an overcast day, looking across a dark, rippling body of water toward a large apartment building. In the foreground on the right side, green shrubs are visible, while green reeds and bushes line the water. In the midground, dense green trees and reeds encircle the lake, partially obscuring the view of the long, multi-story, light-colored building with a flat roof and numerous identical balconies. The sky above is a uniform, pale grey.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

However, it incorrectly states that the camera \"smoothly zooms out throughout the shot.\" The camera is actually static for the entire duration of the video, with no discernible movement, zoom, or panning. The final sentence should be corrected to state that the camera is static.",
