    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a person from behind, positioned slightly left of the center in the middle ground. The ocean occupies the background on the right and top of the frame, while the shoreline is visible in the foreground and middle ground. The person runs away from the camera, moving from the middle ground deeper into the background. As they move, the entire scene becomes heavily blurred, causing the person to shift towards the center of the frame as an indistinct shape. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout this motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with short, dark hair is depicted from the left rear in a low-light setting. They are wearing a long-sleeved shirt with a distinct multi-colored pattern featuring tones of blue, white, and yellow. The entire figure is indistinct and affected by significant motion blur, which obscures their features and the details of their clothing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a beach at dusk, characterized by a dim, light blue and pale sky. A person wearing a patterned shirt is seen from the rear-side, running along the shoreline where the ocean's water and white foam wash ashore. The entire video is affected by significant motion blur, causing the figure and the surrounding environment of sand and sea to appear indistinct and streaked.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that the person \"remains in the foreground.\" In the video, as the person runs away from the camera, they move from the foreground into the midground, becoming smaller in the frame. Additionally, the description of the background in the second part of the shot as \"the sandy landscape appearing in the left midground and background\" is too specific given the heavy blur; a more accurate description would be \"a blurry landscape.\" Finally, the caption should specify that the person moves from the right side of the frame toward the center.",
