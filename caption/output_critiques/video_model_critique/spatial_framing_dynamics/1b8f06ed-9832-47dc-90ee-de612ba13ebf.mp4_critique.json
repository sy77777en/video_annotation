    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a blurry medium shot, where a large white fabric fills the foreground, partially obscuring a man in the center. A woman enters from the left foreground, also behind the fabric, and as it is pulled away, the focus clears. The man and woman run away from the camera, moving from the center foreground toward the center-right middle ground, which transitions the framing into a full shot. A thin wooden stick is positioned in the left foreground, and a building occupies the right middle ground, with hills visible in the background. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a shirtless man with dark skin, short dark hair, and brown shorts positioned centrally in the foreground, pushing through a large blur of white fabric. This fabric belongs to a woman with dark skin and shoulder-length dark curly hair, wearing a white sleeveless dress with a tie at the back. Another woman enters the frame from the left, also pushing through the white fabric, which briefly obscures both of them before moving out of the frame. The woman pursues the man as they run away from the camera, one after the other, up a slope. A thin, crooked wooden stick stands vertically in the middle ground as the two figures continue to run into the distance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors during the day in a sunlit, arid environment under a clear blue sky. The ground consists of reddish-brown dirt, and a rustic, earth-toned building with a weathered facade is situated on the right. In the background, dry, rolling hills are visible. A thin wooden pole is planted in the ground to the left. The shot begins out of focus and transitions with a slow rack focus, using a shallow depth of field to track a woman running away from the camera. A piece of white fabric briefly occupies the foreground, obstructing the view before being moved out of the frame.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts out of focus, with a man vaguely visible in the frame, a middle-shot. Then a woman appears in the video, running away with the man, and finally a full-shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the spatial depth and camera angle. The white fabric is in the foreground, not the midground. The man is consistently in the middle ground, not moving from the foreground. Similarly, after the fabric moves, the woman is in the middle ground, not the right foreground. The statement that the camera is at the subjects' level is inaccurate; the shot is from a low angle, looking up at the subjects. The caption also makes a speculative statement that \"the man pulls the fabric apart,\" which is uncertain. This should be rephrased to describe the fabric's movement without assigning the action, for instance, \"as the fabric is moved.\" The description of the man's movement is also factually incorrect; he is revealed in the middle ground rather than moving into it from the foreground.",

A thin wooden stick stands in the left foreground, a rustic building is in the right middle ground, and hills are visible in the distant background under a clear blue sky.",
