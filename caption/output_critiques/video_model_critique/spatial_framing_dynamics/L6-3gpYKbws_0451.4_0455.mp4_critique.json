    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot, beginning with a low-angle view from the water's surface, where the rippling water occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a sandy beach with palm trees and buildings stretches from the left to the center. A large, green hill is positioned in the background, rising from the center to the right, with the sky and clouds filling the top of the frame. The camera then moves downwards, submerging to reveal an underwater scene. The perspective shifts to a view just above the sandy seabed, which is located at the bottom of the frame. A large school of fish then enters from the right and swims across the middle ground toward the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a coastal and underwater scenery shot, showcasing a tropical paradise. The sequence begins at the water's surface, looking towards a sandy beach lined with palm trees and colorful buildings with red or blue roofs. Some of these buildings are nestled at the foot of a lush, green hill, while others are situated on the hillside, all under a vibrant blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The perspective then dips below the gentle ripples, transitioning into a serene underwater view where the water is a clear turquoise, illuminating a sandy seabed and a large school of small, silvery fish swimming together. The video lacks a main subject, as its purpose is to immerse the viewer in the environment and convey the peaceful, scenic atmosphere of the location, both above and below the water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene opens at the surface of calm, clear water, looking toward a tropical beach under a bright blue sky with white clouds. The sandy shore is lined with palm trees and small buildings with colorful roofs, which extend from the base of a large, green hill up the hillside. The perspective then dips below the surface into the turquoise water, revealing a sandy seabed where a large school of small, silvery fish swims by.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is mostly accurate but can be improved for precision and completeness. The initial description of the water occupying the foreground and extending \"into the background\" is confusing; it should simply state that the rippling water surface occupies the foreground. The camera movement is described as \"moves downwards,\" but \"tilts downwards\" would be a more precise term for the action of submerging. While the description of the fish is good, it could be more specific by noting that the pan to the right reveals the school of fish appearing from the center to the right side of the frame. Finally, the caption omits a dark, circular object, likely part of the camera equipment, which is visible in the bottom-left foreground at the very start of the video.",
