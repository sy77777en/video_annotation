    "pre_caption": "The video uses a medium close-up shot, showing the man from the chest up as the main subject. He is positioned near the center of the frame in the foreground, occupying most of the vertical space, with his head close to the top edge and his torso extending toward the bottom. The camera is held at his eye level, maintaining a direct, frontal perspective. As he moves and turns slightly, the background shifts, revealing snow-covered ground and various structures. White yurts and wooden cabins appear in the middle ground, distributed across the left, center, and right portions of the frame, while a line of bare trees and a low hill form the background, stretching horizontally along the upper part of the frame. The camera’s position remains consistent at the subject’s height, and the spatial relationship between the man and the background elements changes as he rotates, but he consistently remains the dominant foreground element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a light brown complexion, who appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s, is shown from the chest up in a selfie-style shot. He has short, black hair and a full, neatly trimmed black beard and mustache. He is wearing a black, hooded puffer jacket, which is open, revealing a maroon sweatshirt underneath with partially visible white lettering. Throughout the video, he speaks directly to the camera, his facial expression shifting as he talks and looks around his surroundings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed, captures a vast, snow-covered landscape under a gray, overcast sky. The ground is completely blanketed in thick, white snow. In the background, several white yurts with wooden door frames are visible, along with a few small, wooden cabins, including a red one and a brown one. A line of bare trees and a low, forested hill can be seen in the distance, bordering the open, snowy field.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states the camera maintains a \"direct, frontal perspective.\" While the shot begins with a frontal view, the man's orientation relative to the camera changes to a profile and three-quarter view as he turns, a detail that should be included for accuracy. Additionally, the phrase \"spins around\" could be replaced with the more precise term \"turns.\" Finally, the description of the man's position (\"occupying most of the vertical space... and his torso extending toward the bottom\") is redundant after establishing the medium close-up shot size and could be condensed for better conciseness.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video uses a medium close-up shot, showing the man from the chest up as the main subject in the foreground. The camera is held at his eye level. The shot begins with a frontal view of the man, but as he turns, his orientation relative to the camera shifts to a three-quarter and profile view. This movement reveals the surrounding snow-covered landscape, which includes white yurts and wooden cabins in the middle ground. In the distance, a line of bare trees and a low hill stretch across the horizon. The camera remains stationary at the subject's height, with his turning motion changing the composition and revealing more of the background.",
