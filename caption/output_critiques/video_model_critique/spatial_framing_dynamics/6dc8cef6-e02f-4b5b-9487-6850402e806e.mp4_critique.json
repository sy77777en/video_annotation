    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured from a high, top-down perspective, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. She stands at a long kitchen counter that extends horizontally across the scene. In the foreground, at the bottom of the frame, another person's hands are visible working on a separate surface. The woman's multiple arms move rapidly in a circular pattern around her central position, interacting with various bowls and ingredients placed on the counter. The camera maintains its overhead position but has a slight, unsteady movement, creating motion blur at the edges of the frame. Near the end of the clip, red text is superimposed in the foreground at the bottom center of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a bird's eye view, a woman with tan skin and dark hair styled in a long, tight braid stands at a stainless steel kitchen counter. She wears a white short-sleeved shirt under a pink and white checkered apron. In a surreal depiction, she appears to have multiple arms, all simultaneously engaged in preparing food by stirring, mixing, and handling various ingredients in bowls. At the bottom of the scene, another person's hands are visible, assembling small, round food items. The red text \"in hundreds of hands\" is superimposed over the lower portion of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye view, the scene captures a busy kitchen with a warm, greenish-yellow lighting cast over the environment. A person in a red-and-white checkered apron stands centrally at a long stainless steel countertop, which is cluttered with various bowls and food preparation items. These include small white and red bowls, larger green plastic bowls, and baskets containing ingredients. The floor has a patterned tile design. The scene is filled with a sense of rapid motion, evident in the blur surrounding the person's quick movements as they work. An overlay of red text reading \"in hundreds of hands\" is visible at the bottom of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

The woman is not in the foreground; from this top-down perspective, she is in the middle ground, with the elements at the very top of the frame constituting the background. The hands visible at the bottom of the frame are in the foreground. Furthermore, the description that these hands are \"on the opposite side of the table from the woman\" is spatially inaccurate. The hands are in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, while the woman is positioned further back in the scene.
