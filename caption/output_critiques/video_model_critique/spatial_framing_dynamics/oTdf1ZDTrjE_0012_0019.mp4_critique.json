    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a man stands in the center foreground, holding a drone controller. To his left in the foreground, a camera is mounted on a tripod. The middle ground is filled with a sea of clouds that extends across the frame, below the man and the tripod. In the background, a mountain range is visible above the clouds, with a clear sky occupying the top portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at the man's level and slowly pushes in, causing the man and the tripod to gradually become larger within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a medium skin tone stands facing the camera. He is wearing a bright yellow short-sleeved T-shirt, dark-colored pants, a brown fedora-style hat, and sunglasses. He holds a black drone controller with a screen in both hands at chest level. To the left, a black camera is mounted on a tall, black tripod with its legs extended. A smaller black rectangular device is attached to one of the tripod's legs, connected to the camera by a cable with a reflective texture that appears to be a light color.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a grassy mountaintop during the day, under a clear, light blue sky. A vast sea of thick, white clouds blankets the valley below, with the peaks of a distant mountain range rising above them. In the foreground, a man wearing a yellow t-shirt, dark brown pants, and a brown hat stands holding a black remote controller. To the left, a black camera is positioned on a tripod. The ground is covered with green grass and small bushes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the camera movement is inaccurate. The caption states the camera \"moves backward while simultaneously zooming in,\" but observation of the foreground and background elements reveals the opposite motion. The camera is actually moving forward (dollying in) while simultaneously zooming out to keep the man's size consistent in the frame. The phrase \"moves backward while simultaneously zooming in on the man\" should be corrected to \"smoothly moves forward while simultaneously zooming out\". Additionally, the description of the clouds' position, \"below or approximately at the same elevation as the ground on which the man and the tripod stand,\" can be made more concise by changing it to \"below the hilltop\".",
