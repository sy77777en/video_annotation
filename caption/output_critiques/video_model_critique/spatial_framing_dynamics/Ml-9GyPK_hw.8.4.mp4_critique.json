    "pre_caption": "This scenery video presents a static, high-angle close-up shot where the surface of a body of water fills the entire frame. The water, characterized by a dense pattern of small, diagonal ripples, occupies the whole visual plane, functioning as the immediate foreground with no discernible middle ground or background. The camera remains stationary, capturing the continuous and gentle diagonal movement of the ripples across the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This nature scenery shot presents a high-angle, close-up view of a body of water. The surface is a deep, rich purple, textured with a dense pattern of small, diagonal ripples that catch a soft, warm light on their crests. There is no main subject in the video. The focus is entirely on the mesmerizing, almost abstract pattern and gentle movement of the water's surface, creating a tranquil and atmospheric scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, the video captures the surface of a body of water. The water is a deep purple hue, and its surface is covered in a dense pattern of small, uniform ripples. These ripples move gently and continuously in a diagonal direction, with low-angle light catching their crests, creating a textured appearance against the darker troughs.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption uses speculative language (\"appears to move left,\" \"this effect is likely due to\"), which violates the instruction to avoid speculative statements. The description of movement should be stated factually by describing only what is visibly occurring. The final sentence should be revised to remove the speculation about camera motion and instead describe the observable movement of the water, stating that the ripples move continuously and diagonally across the frame from the top right toward the bottom left.",
