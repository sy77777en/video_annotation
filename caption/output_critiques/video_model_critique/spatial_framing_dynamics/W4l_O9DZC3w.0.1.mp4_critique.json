    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames the scene from outside the front of a car, looking through the windshield. In the foreground, a man in a striped sweater occupies the bottom left of the frame in the passenger seat, initially looking left before turning his head toward the center. In the middle ground, two silhouetted figures are positioned in the center-right, kissing in the back seat. Also in the middle ground, a large bunch of balloons is visible in the top right, attached to the rear of the car. The background consists of a hilly landscape and an overcast sky visible through the car's windows. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Inside a light-colored sedan, a man with dark curly hair and a short beard sits in the front passenger seat, initially looking to the left before turning his head to face the camera while wearing a colorful, horizontally striped knit sweater. The driver's seat is unoccupied. In the back seat, a man with short, dark curly hair and a woman with long, dark curly hair are seen in silhouette, kissing each other. A large bunch of multicolored balloons, including purple, blue, orange, pink, yellow, and red, is attached to the rear of the car.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is viewed from the front of a light-colored sedan, looking through the windshield into the interior. The car is outdoors under an overcast sky, with a hilly landscape in the background. A large bunch of multi-colored balloons, including purple, blue, orange, pink, red, and yellow, is attached to the rear of the car. Inside, a person wearing a colorful striped sweater sits in the front passenger seat, while two silhouetted figures occupy the back seats.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
