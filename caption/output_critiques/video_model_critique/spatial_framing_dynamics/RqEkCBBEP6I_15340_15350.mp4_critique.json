    "pre_caption": "In this third-person perspective, the shot alternates between a medium shot and a medium close-up of a man who begins in the bottom-left foreground. He stands on train tracks that run from the bottom of the frame into the center background, leading to a collapsed tunnel end. In the middle ground, yellow police tape stretches across the tracks, with metal barriers and an orange cone on the right. A faint, circular ripple is visible on the rock wall in the center background. As the man raises his gun, the camera, positioned at his level, zooms into a medium close-up, centering him in the frame. He then walks forward, moving from the foreground to the middle ground, while the camera follows from behind and pulls back to a medium shot. During his advance, the ripple in the center background transforms into a dark, circular void. The man stops in the middle ground, centered in the frame, facing the void in the background. Static UI elements remain in the bottom-left and bottom-right corners throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a third-person perspective, a man with neck-length, dark, shaggy hair is shown from behind. He wears a dark, textured coat, and carries a satchel with a strap slung over his shoulder. He moves around the train tracks inside a dimly lit tunnel. He raises a dark handgun with his right hand, occasionally aiming it forward, while using his left hand to hold a flashlight, also aimed forward. At the end of the tunnel, a faint, circular, light-blue ripple appears in the air, which then separates into a dark, black, circular void with a shimmering, distorted outline.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-shoulder POV shot frames a character in a dark, collapsed train tunnel. The arched, rock-walled tunnel is filled with a green-tinted haze, and a set of train tracks runs toward a rockfall that blocks the path, cordoned off by yellow police tape. To the right, metal barriers, an orange traffic cone, a yellow evidence marker numbered '8', and red bloodstains are visible near a pool of water on the wet ground, illuminated by bright work lights. A circular, shimmering distortion is present on the rock wall from the beginning of the video. The character occasionally aims a handgun and flashlight at it, and it later separates into a dark, void-like circle without vanishing. Overlays are present on the screen. In the bottom-left corner, white text reads \"COLLAPSED TUNNEL,\" \"MISSING FBI AGENT,\" and \"PLOT BOARD,\" with a switch icon beside it. A heads-up display in the bottom-right corner shows an ammunition count, inventory, and a health bar.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a third-person game perspective. The shot size keeps switching between a medium shot and a medium close-up shot of the character as the camera zooms in and out.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "There is a significant factual error in the caption: the man walks forward toward the collapsed tunnel, not backward. Additionally, the description of the shot size change is inaccurate; when the man moves forward, the camera zooms back out to the initial medium shot, not a medium-full shot. The yellow police tape is located in the middle ground, not the background. The description of the camera movement could be clearer; instead of \"alternates,\" it would be more precise to state that the camera zooms into a medium close-up and then zooms back out to a medium shot. Finally, the description of the ripple \"separating\" into a void could be improved with clearer wording, such as \"transforms into.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a third-person perspective, the video begins with a medium shot of a man in the bottom-left foreground.
