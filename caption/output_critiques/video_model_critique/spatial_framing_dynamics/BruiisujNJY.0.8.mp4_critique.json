    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is framed from a low angle, looking up at two figures floating in a dark forest. The primary figure is positioned in the upper right of the middle ground. A second, more distant figure is visible in the background, to the left of the center. The scene is framed by tall tree trunks, with one prominent trunk on the far left in the foreground and another in the center, situated between the camera and the main floating figure. The mossy forest floor occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame, while the dense trees recede into the deep background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark forest, a figure floats in the air on the right side of the scene. This person wears a robe composed of black, white, and red fabric, with pieces of translucent white material billowing around them. Their head is covered by a dark hood or headpiece. Further in the background and to the left, a second, similar figure is also seen floating among the trees, dressed in dark attire, though less detailed due to the distance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dark, dense forest, possibly at dusk or during an overcast day. Tall, slender tree trunks dominate the landscape, rising from a moss-covered forest floor. A misty atmosphere pervades the scene, with light particles resembling snow falling gently throughout the woods. Two figures are suspended in mid-air between the trees; one in the foreground is dressed in flowing red, black, and translucent white fabric.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the shot size and provides a vague description of the camera's movement. The phrase \"As the camera moves\" is not specific enough; the camera is performing a slow forward dolly while simultaneously tilting up. The first two sentences should be revised to incorporate the shot size and a more precise description of the camera's motion. For instance, the description could start by identifying the shot as a wide shot that begins from a level perspective and then transitions to a low angle through a slow forward dolly and upward tilt. The rest of the spatial description of the figures and forest elements is accurate.",
