    "pre_caption": "A computer monitor is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground of the scene. In the background, an out-of-focus, vertically striped wall is visible. On the monitor's screen, a stylized digital window with a glowing outline is centered. Text appears in the top-left area inside this window, followed by a file icon materializing in the right-hand area of the same window. The shot remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark purple computer monitor displays a stylized digital window with a glowing, neon-green outline against a dark background. The window features a title bar with three white dots on the left. Inside, under the username \"Xboxdevguy,\" the text \"100k for CoD\" appears in white. A stylized file icon, which looks like a white document with a folded corner, then appears under the username \"Xenomega.\" The file is labeled \"CoD.zip\" in white text. At the bottom of the window, a text field is labeled \"Reply..\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit room with a purple ambiance, a computer monitor is shown in a close-up view. On the screen, a stylized window with a glowing, light-green outline is displayed. Within this window, text appears in the upper-left corner, reading \"Xboxdevguy\" and \"LOOK for CoD.\" Shortly after, a file icon materializes on the right, labeled with \"Xenomega\" above it and \"CoD.zip\" below. A \"Reply..\" prompt remains visible at the bottom of the glowing frame. In the upper right corner, there is overlaid text with a transparent gray background and white font that reads \"Fictional text.\" In the lower left corner, another overlaid text with a transparent gray background and white font displays \"[6].\" The out-of-focus background features vertical stripes and the indistinct shapes of what appear to be books on a shelf beneath the monitor.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The term \"full shot\" is inaccurate for this context; it should be replaced with \"A close-up shot\" since the monitor is the primary subject and occupies the majority of the frame. The description of the camera's position, \"The camera is positioned at the computer monitor,\" is vague. It should be revised to specify the height, such as \"The camera is positioned at eye-level with the monitor,\" to be more descriptive. Finally, the description of the background is in a separate sentence, which could be integrated into the first sentence for better conciseness.",
