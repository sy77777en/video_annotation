    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot, taken from a level angle, centered on a dark, rectangular iron grid. The grid is then lifted upwards and moves out of the top of the frame, revealing a view from within a confined space. The shot remains a close-up, now framed by stacks of wrapped paper products in the foreground, which occupy the bottom, left, and right sides of the frame. In the middle ground, a single thin strand hangs from the top center of the newly created opening. Through this central opening, a blurry, out-of-focus background is visible. The camera's position remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on a dark, rectangular iron grid with horizontal slots. As the grid is lifted, it reveals the contents of a confined space. On either side are stacks of old, grayish-brown paper products, possibly documents, which are wrapped in a cloth-like material and secured with string. The bundles appear aged and dusty. A single, thin strand resembling a cobweb hangs from the top of the opening, and nearby, there appears to be a piece of yarn hanging.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From within a dark and enclosed space, a rectangular grate with horizontal slats is lifted downwards. The interior is filled with stacks of old, dusty bundles wrapped in cloth and tied with string, which frame the view on the left, right, and bottom. As the grate rises, it reveals a blurry, out-of-focus background. The scene is dimly lit, with the main light source originating from outside the opening, casting the interior into deep shadow. A single piece of string dangles from the top of the opening in the center-left of the view, next to a single line of cobweb.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a close-up shot of a scene resembling a ventilation duct outlet, taken from a level angle. Initially, the outlet is closed off by an iron grid located at the center of the frame; as the iron grid is opened, it reveals a close-up of some paper products inside the duct, as well as a blurred background outside the duct.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

The description states, \"The grid is then lifted downwards and moves out of the frame from the lower center,\" but the video clearly shows the grid being lifted upwards and moving out of the frame from the upper center. This should be corrected to \"The grid is then lifted upwards and moves out of the frame from the upper center.\" Additionally, for improved conciseness, the phrase \"next to a line of cobweb\" could be omitted, as the \"line of cobweb\" is less distinct than the primary hanging strand.",
