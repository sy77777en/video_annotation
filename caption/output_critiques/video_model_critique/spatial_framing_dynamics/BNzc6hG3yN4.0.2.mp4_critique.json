    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, top-down perspective, the scene is presented in a full shot. A person in a blue hoodie is positioned in the center-left of the frame, lying on the hood of a car that occupies the bottom half of the scene, both situated in the middle ground against a background of cracked pavement. Initially, a second person dressed in black is on the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground, leaning against the car. This second person then moves away from the vehicle toward the bottom right, and their body exits the frame until only their lower legs and feet are visible in the bottom right foreground. The main subject, the car, and the camera remain stationary throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high, top-down perspective, a young person with dark hair leans against the hood of a light blue car. This main subject, who is looking up, wears a blue and white tie-dye patterned hoodie and light-wash jeans. To their right, another person is also leaning against the hood. This second person, dressed in a black long-sleeved top, black pants, and black-and-white sneakers, takes a couple of steps away from the vehicle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, top-down perspective, the scene is set on a cracked, light gray concrete surface during the daytime. The pavement is covered in a network of dark cracks, and a few small pieces of white debris are scattered on the ground. The front hood of a light blue car occupies the lower portion of the view. A person wearing a blue and white patterned jacket and light-colored pants is leaning against the car's hood. Initially, a second person, dressed in black pants and black-and-white footwear, is fully visible on the right side of the frame, leaning against the car. As the scene progresses, this person moves away, leaving only their legs and feet visible in the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that \"Only the car remains stationary,\" when the person lying on the hood of the car also remains stationary throughout the shot. The use of 3D depth terms like \"middle ground\" and \"background\" is inaccurate for this top-down perspective, as all subjects are on the same ground plane. The cracked pavement is the surface they are on, not a \"background\" in the traditional sense. The description of the second person \"leaning against the car\" is an interpretation; \"standing next to the car\" is more neutral. Finally, the phrase \"with the main subject occupying less than 50% of the width and height in the frame\" is overly detailed and can be removed, as \"full shot\" sufficiently describes the framing.",
