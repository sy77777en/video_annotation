    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a blurry cityscape scenery, with no main subjects. The scene is framed as a view through a wet window. In the foreground, the title \"DREAMSCAPE\" is positioned centrally, with the text \"</disrupt>\" above it in the top left and \"fiction... from beyond!\" below it in the bottom right. The background is a high-contrast, out-of-focus view of city lights, with the faint outline of a \"MOTEL\" sign visible in the middle ground on the left. As the clip progresses, the central title and the text below it slowly roll and fade out, disappearing from the frame. Concurrently, the background scene itself rolls slightly, suggesting camera movement. In the bottom-left corner, green text appears sequentially, remaining fixed in its position. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking out onto the city.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a blurry, atmospheric cityscape scenery shot, depicted in black and white as if viewed through a rain-streaked window. The out-of-focus background features bright, indistinct lights of a city, creating a hazy and dreamlike quality. There is no main subject in the scene; the focus is intentionally placed on establishing a moody urban atmosphere rather than highlighting any specific element within the environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is a blurry, high-contrast, black-and-white view of a rainy city at night, seen through a wet window pane. Out-of-focus city lights create a bright, abstract background where the faint outline of a \"MOTEL\" sign is visible. Water droplets and streaks cover the view. Overlaying the scene is the central title \"DREAMSCAPE™\" in large, 3D white letters with a purple and blue gradient on top. Additional text overlays include \"</disrupt>\" positioned above the main title and \"fiction... from beyond!\" below it. In the bottom-left corner, green text appears, eventually displaying \"SHANGHAI - 2032\". The title gradually rolls and fades out, while the scene itself slowly rolls as the camera moves. The text appears gradually, as if being typed onto the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states that \"all surrounding texts gradually roll and fade out,\" which is inaccurate because the green text in the bottom-left corner appears and remains fixed. The description should be corrected to specify that only the central title card elements (\"DREAMSCAPE,\" \"</disrupt>,\" and \"fiction... from beyond!\") fade out, while the green text in the corner appears and stays. Additionally, the caption omits that the small \"TM\" symbol appears next to the title partway through, rather than being present from the start; this dynamic detail should be included. Finally, the phrase \"neither at the top nor bottom of the frame\" is slightly awkward and could be rephrased more directly by stating the text is in the \"upper-left and lower-right quadrants.\"",

The out-of-focus background shows city lights, with the faint outline of a \"MOTEL\" sign visible on the left. As the clip progresses, a small \"TM\" symbol appears next to the \"DREAMSCAPE\" title. Subsequently, the title, along with the \"</disrupt>\" and \"fiction... from beyond!\" text, slowly rolls and fades away. In contrast, green text appears sequentially in the bottom-left corner and remains fixed in place. The background scene also rolls slightly, suggesting camera movement from a high angle looking out over the city.",
