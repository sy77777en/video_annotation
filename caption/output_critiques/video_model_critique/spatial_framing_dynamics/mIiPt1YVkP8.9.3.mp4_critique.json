    "pre_caption": "This static full shot shows a white, unmarked airplane positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground. The aircraft sits on a runway that stretches from the bottom of the frame. Behind the plane, in the middle ground, winding taxiways are visible, while the silhouettes of distant buildings line the top of the frame in the background. The camera is positioned above the airplane, providing an elevated view of the entire scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white, unmarked passenger airplane is positioned on an airport runway, situated over the white threshold markings. The jet airliner has one engine mounted beneath its left wing and upward-curving winglets at the tips of its wings. The aircraft is stationary and not angled from the viewer's perspective.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene at an airport is depicted at either dawn or dusk. A plain white, unmarked passenger airplane sits stationary on a dark asphalt runway, which is detailed with white painted markings. In the midground, winding taxiways are visible, and the silhouettes of distant buildings are set against a sky with a warm, orange hue.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the camera movement is inaccurate. The phrase \"moves downward while tilting upward\" is contradictory and does not correctly represent the camera's motion. A more accurate description would be that the camera moves downward and slightly forward. Additionally, the final sentence, \"The elevated view offers a comprehensive look at the entire scene,\" is partly interpretive (\"comprehensive look\"). The camera's height should be stated more directly at the beginning of the description, for example, by identifying it as a high-angle shot, and the interpretive part of the sentence should be removed for better conciseness and adherence to descriptive-only instructions.",
