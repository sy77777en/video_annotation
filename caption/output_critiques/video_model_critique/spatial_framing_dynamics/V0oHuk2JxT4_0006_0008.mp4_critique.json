    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman is positioned in the foreground, occupying the center-right of the frame. A black bollard is visible in the bottom-left foreground, with green bushes situated behind the woman and extending across the lower portion of the scene. In the mid-ground, a large black sign is located in the center-left. The background features a clock tower in the center, with a modern glass building to its right and other buildings to its left. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, remains relatively stable as the woman moves. She initially extends her right arm toward the bottom-left corner and her left arm toward the top right, then raises her left arm while bringing her right arm across her body, causing a slight shift in her upper body's position within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young adult woman with light skin and dark, shoulder-length hair styled with bangs is prominently positioned in the center, extending towards the right side of the frame. She wears a white, long-sleeved blouse with full sleeves, a black skirt, and a long, black beaded necklace with a rectangular pendant. Her arms are extended in a dynamic pose, and her facial expression shifts from a focused look with slightly parted lips to a wide-mouthed smile.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor daytime scene is set at The Londoner Macao under an overcast sky. In the background, a prominent replica of the Elizabeth Tower stands next to modern glass-fronted high-rises and a reddish-brick building. A large, black sign with \"THE LONDONER\" in gold letters is positioned in the mid-ground. The foreground features a landscaped area with green bushes and a short, black bollard. A woman in a white top and black skirt is present in the foreground, in front of the greenery.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the woman's arm movements. Initially, her arms are not crossed; her right arm is extended forward toward the camera, and her left arm is bent across her chest. She then raises her left arm up and back, while her right arm remains extended forward, moving slightly to the side. Additionally, her position is more accurately described as being in the 'center' of the frame rather than the 'center-right'.",
