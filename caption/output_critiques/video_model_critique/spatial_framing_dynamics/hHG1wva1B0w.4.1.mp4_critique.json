    "pre_caption": "This is a static full shot featuring a red male figure on the left and a white female figure on the right, both standing in the middle ground on a sidewalk. To the far left in the middle ground is a fire hydrant, with a utility pole positioned between it and the male figure. A row of mailboxes stands in the middle ground to the right of the female figure. The foreground is occupied by an asphalt road, and the background is composed of grey houses. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man rendered in solid red stands on a sidewalk, facing a woman rendered in solid white. The man, positioned on the left, has long, shoulder-length hair and is dressed in a long-sleeved shirt and pants. His left hand hangs naturally at his side, while his right hand rests near the hem of his shirt. The woman stands opposite him with one hand on her hip. She has her hair styled in a bun and is wearing a sleeveless, knee-length dress and high heels. They appear to be engaged in a conversation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a stylized, monochromatic suburban street during the day. In the background, grey houses with dark roofs are visible. A grey sidewalk runs alongside an asphalt road, and on it stand a grey fire hydrant, a utility pole, and a row of four grey mailboxes. Two stylized human figures are positioned on the sidewalk; one is rendered entirely in red, and the other is white. The overall environment is presented in shades of grey, contrasting with the single red figure. An overlay of white text '[11]' is located in the bottom left corner of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the camera movement is inaccurate. The caption states the camera is \"shifting to the left,\" but the video shows the camera panning to the right, which causes the subjects to move from the center to the left side of the frame. The camera itself does not move left. You should correct this by replacing \"and shifting to the left\" with a more accurate description of the camera's pan and its effect on the subjects' position within the frame. For instance, state that the camera pans right, causing the subjects to shift toward the left of the frame.",
