    "pre_caption": "This full shot, filmed at the subjects' level, initially frames a small white lion cub in the center-right foreground. The cub walks away from the camera through tall green grass, moving toward the center of the middle ground. In the middle ground, two tawny lionesses are lying down, one on the left and another more centrally, partially obscured by the grass that occupies the entire frame from the foreground to the background. The camera remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a small, white lion cub, viewed from behind as it walks through tall, green grass. Its fur is a uniform white, and its long tail twitches as it moves. In the middle ground, two larger, tawny-colored lionesses are lying down amongst the grass, with the cub walking toward them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunlit field of tall, green grass, a small white lion cub walks away from the camera. In the middle ground, two lions lie among tall, yellow-green grasses. The grass stems are vibrant green, topped with clusters of yellowish spike-like inflorescences. Behind them, layers of even denser, darker green grass overlap.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly identifies the shot size as a \"full shot\"; it should be corrected to a \"medium shot\" since the lions' entire bodies are not visible. The description also omits a key detail: as the camera pans left, a third tawny lioness is revealed in the left middle ground, in addition to the two initially mentioned. Finally, the description of the camera movement could be more precise by stating that the pan left and upward tilt re-frames the scene, bringing the lioness on the left to the center of the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This medium shot, filmed at the subjects' level, initially frames a small white lion cub in the center-right foreground. The cub walks away from the camera through tall green grass, moving toward the middle ground where three tawny lionesses are lying down, partially obscured by the grass that fills the frame. The camera then pans left and tilts up slightly, reframing the scene to bring the leftmost lioness toward the center of the frame as the cub approaches the others.",
