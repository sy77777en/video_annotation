    "pre_caption": "In a third-person, over-the-shoulder perspective that provides a wide shot of the scene, a man is consistently framed in a medium shot in the bottom-center foreground, with the camera positioned at his level. He walks forward along a narrow path that recedes from the foreground into the middle ground, flanked by rock walls on the left and right sides of the frame. Initially, a rustic building is visible in the center middle ground. As the camera follows the man's forward movement, a tall stone bell tower emerges from the fog in the central background, positioned behind the building, while several small figures become visible moving in the middle ground at the end of the path.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short, blond hair is seen from behind, walking forward. He is wearing a dark brown leather jacket with a light-colored shearling collar. A rustic building is already visible in the foggy distance ahead of him. As he proceeds, a tall stone bell tower gradually emerges from the fog, along with several indistinct figures moving near the tower.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot, framing a character from the hip up, follows them as they walk along a narrow, muddy path through a rocky ravine. The path is flanked by dark, jagged rock walls and overgrown with trees and foliage. In the distance, a rustic building and a tall stone bell tower emerge from the dense fog under an overcast sky, creating a dimly lit and damp atmosphere.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a third-person game perspective. The camera follows the character's movement, showing a medium shot of them, while showing a wide shot of the scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits a gate that becomes visible on the right side of the path in the middle ground as the man moves forward. This element should be added to the description of the changing scene. Additionally, the phrase \"at the rear side of the building\" is slightly awkward and should be revised to the clearer \"behind the building.\" Finally, the opening clause \"that provides a wide shot of the scene\" is redundant because the detailed description of the environment already conveys the wide scope of the shot; removing it would improve conciseness.",
