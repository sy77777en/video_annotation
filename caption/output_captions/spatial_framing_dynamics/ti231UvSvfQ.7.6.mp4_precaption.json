    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is an older, light-skinned man with a balding head and short, graying hair on the sides, who appears to be speaking. He wears a light gray polo shirt under a gray, ribbed, zip-up cardigan with darker gray patches on the shoulders. He leans forward and then sits back, gesturing with his hands. To his right, a middle-aged, light-skinned man with short, thinning dark hair sits in profile, listening while wearing a dark shirt. In the foreground, the back of a third person's head and shoulder, with dark hair, partially obscures the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV, where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the scene is set in a dimly lit indoor room. The environment has a desaturated, almost monochromatic color scheme. In the background, a black-and-white photograph of a person in uniform hangs on the wall. Two men are at a table in the middle of the room.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames the scene from an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the back of a person's head and shoulder occupying the bottom-left foreground. In the middle ground, an older man in a gray cardigan is initially positioned in the center-left, leaning forward over a table. To his right, another man in a dark shirt sits in the right middle ground. The main subject then pushes himself back into his chair, moving from a forward-leaning posture to a more upright position in the center of the middle ground. In the background, a photograph hangs on the wall to the left, and a dark doorway is visible to the right. The camera remains stationary at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
