    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with dark hair, wearing a black baseball cap and a matching light beige long-sleeved shirt and pants, performs a series of floor-based acrobatic movements on a concrete slab. He is watched by a large group of approximately 15 to 20 other young men who are gathered on a grassy area, either sitting or standing. The spectators, who have dark hair and are dressed in casual attire like t-shirts, hoodies, and some wearing sunglasses or hats, observe the performance. One of them is wearing a yellow inner layer with a pea green coat. Among them, one man in a black t-shirt sits on a red bicycle on the right, while another man in a black hoodie is on a small red and black bike to the left. A blue cooler with a white lid is also visible on the grass near the group.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds on a suburban street under an overcast sky, with the camera rotating and tilting to create a dynamic, off-kilter perspective. A large group of young men are gathered on a grassy verge next to a paved road, with single-story residential houses and a dark wooden fence in the background. One individual performs a dynamic move on the concrete curb while others sit and stand on the grass, some with small bicycles. A blue cooler with a white lid sits on the lawn, and to the right, a large, custom-built speaker system is positioned on the grass adjacent to the road. The constant, swirling motion of the camera causes the horizon to shift dramatically throughout the sequence.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of a group of people watching a person performing floor movements, who is initially half visible, but as he moves forward, his full body becomes visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide, Dutch-angle shot where a group of people is positioned in the middle ground, spanning from the left to the center of the frame on a grassy area, with houses and a fence in the background. A performer is initially in the center of the middle ground, beginning a floor-based movement. The camera then executes a rapid, continuous rotation, causing the entire scene to spin within the frame and the horizon to tilt dramatically. During this camera movement, the performer travels from the middle ground to the foreground, completing his action on a concrete slab at the bottom center of the frame. A person on a bicycle is positioned in the middle ground on the right, while another person on a small bike is on the left, also in the middle ground. The shot, filmed from the subjects' level, concludes with the performer fully visible in the foreground and the group of spectators in the middle ground.",
