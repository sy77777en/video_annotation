    "pre_caption": "This video begins with an extreme wide shot, featuring a small, distant airplane positioned in the center of the frame against a black background. In the foreground, blurry runway markings and two faint aircraft are visible across the bottom of the frame, with the two aircraft located in the bottom left. As the shot progresses, the central airplane moves directly toward the camera, remaining in the center while increasing in size, which transitions the shot into a wide shot. Simultaneously, the foreground elements at the bottom, including the runway and the aircraft on it, move downward and out of the frame. The camera is positioned below the main airplane, looking up throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white commercial airplane is shown against a solid black background. The aircraft is viewed from the front as it flies directly toward the camera, starting as a small, distant point and progressively enlarging. It is a passenger jet with two engines, one mounted under each wing. Initially, two white aircraft are faintly visible on the airport runway in the bottom left corner of the frame, gradually moving out of the frame as the video progresses.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Initially, a light-colored commercial airplane is visible on the right side of the frame against a solid black night sky. As the camera shifts, the aircraft moves to the center, starting as a distant outline and gradually growing larger, revealing its form, including two engines mounted beneath its wings. At the very bottom of the scene, the light-colored, out-of-focus markings of an airport runway are visible, but they eventually move out of the lower part of the frame. Additionally, two faintly visible white aircraft on the runway appear in the bottom left corner at first and also move out of the frame as the video progresses.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
