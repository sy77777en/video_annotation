    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a woman underwater through a submerging shot that begins with a split-level view of the water's surface and the dark depths below. Initially, the woman is a silhouette, but as the viewpoint goes fully underwater, she is seen more clearly. The woman has light skin and brown hair that floats freely around her head. She is wearing an orange bikini top paired with a white tulle skirt on the lower part of her body and is in a reclined position with her knees bent, surrounded by rising air bubbles in the deep blue water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a split perspective, capturing both the surface and underwater scenes of a large body of water. Initially, the view shows a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds above the dark, undulating water. The scene then transitions to focus solely on the above-water view before quickly switching to an underwater perspective. Below the surface, in the deep blue water, a person is submerged, creating numerous small, white bubbles that rise and disturb the water. The overall scene is dominated by shades of blue, with light filtering from above.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a split-level wide shot, where the sky occupies the top half of the frame in the background and the water's surface cuts horizontally across the middle. In the bottom half, a woman is partially visible in the middle ground, with her hand positioned in the bottom left. The camera then submerges, causing the water surface to rise and exit the top of the frame, transitioning the scene to a full shot entirely underwater. In the final composition, the woman is located in the center and right of the frame in the middle ground, while the water's surface is now seen from below at the top of the frame. Bubbles rise from the bottom right and center towards the top, and the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
