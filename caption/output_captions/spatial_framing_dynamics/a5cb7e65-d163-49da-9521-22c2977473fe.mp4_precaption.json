    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a bird's-eye angle shot filmed at aerial level, a woman with light skin and dark hair is the central subject, lying face down on the ground. She wears a light-colored, short outfit with dark patterns. A long, thin, silver-colored object resembling a sword is placed in front of her, at a slight distance. Positioned in a circle around her are four other figures, each completely obscured by a dark, hooded cloak. These cloaked figures are standing and appear to be looking down toward the central woman.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, top-down perspective, the scene unfolds within a large, circular indoor chamber. The floor is composed of dark, rectangular stones arranged in a pattern of concentric rings, partially covered by a white, crystalline substance that resembles frost or snow. The environment is dimly lit with a cool, purplish-blue hue. In the center of the room, a woman initially kneels on the ground and then lies face down, while several other figures in dark cloaks stand motionless around the perimeter.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide, high-angle shot from directly above, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground. Initially kneeling on a circular stone floor, she is surrounded by four static, cloaked figures in the middle ground, located at the top left, bottom left, bottom right, and top right of the frame. The woman then moves, falling forward to lie face down on the floor while remaining in the central position. The camera and the surrounding figures remain stationary throughout the shot.",
