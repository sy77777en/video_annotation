    "pre_caption": "The video uses a close-up shot, framing the person\u2019s torso, arms, and hands as they interact with a stack of books. The person\u2019s hands and the open book are positioned centrally in the frame and occupy the foreground, with the book\u2019s pages and the person\u2019s fingers clearly visible as they turn and press the pages. The stack of additional books is visible at the bottom left and bottom center of the frame, also in the foreground. The person\u2019s torso, clothed in a white shirt, fills the middle ground and extends across the center and right side of the frame. The background is out of focus and occupies the upper and far left and right edges, remaining in the background throughout. The camera remains at the subject\u2019s height, parallel to the book and hands, and there are no significant changes in shot size or spatial arrangement between the two frames, though the hands move slightly as pages are turned.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a person with light skin wearing a plain white short-sleeved shirt, holding and interacting with an open book. One hand is holding the book, while the other hand is used to turn the pages and press them flat. The book has a white cover and contains densely printed text, and there are additional books with visible colored covers stacked beneath it. The person\u2019s posture suggests they are focused on reading, with their arms bent and the book held close to their body.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a well-lit environment, likely during the daytime, as natural light softly illuminates the scene. A person is standing, holding several books in their hands. They are flipping through the top book in the stack, which has white pages with dense, small black text. The cover of another book beneath it is partially visible, showing a solid color. The person is wearing a plain white short-sleeved shirt, and the background is out of focus, suggesting a calm, quiet setting. No overlays, text, or digital elements are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
