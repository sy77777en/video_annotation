    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a semi-truck positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Sandy terrain with bushes occupies the foreground at the bottom left, while distant trees and sand are visible in the background. The camera then moves horizontally to the right, parallel to the stationary truck. This movement causes the framing to tighten, transitioning into a medium shot that focuses on the truck's cab. By the end of the shot, the cab is framed on the left, with the front portion of the white trailer occupying the right side of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a modern semi-truck composed of a black tractor unit and a white box trailer. The tractor has a glossy black finish, a high-roof cab, and a light-colored horizontal panel above the windshield. Its front grille features a single horizontal white trim strip. The attached trailer is a large, white rectangular box with two axles at the rear. The side of the trailer has a rectangular concave surface and a large embossed and recessed pattern located in the center. There is also a section of black and white diagonal stripes near where it connects to the tractor.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a bright, arid landscape under a partly cloudy sky, a black semi-truck with a white trailer is stationary on an asphalt road. The road cuts through sandy terrain dotted with dry bushes and distant trees. The white trailer features a design that resembles a hollowed-out or embossed and recessed effect on its side.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
