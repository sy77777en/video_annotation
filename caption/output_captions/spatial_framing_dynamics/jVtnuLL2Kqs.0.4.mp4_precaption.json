    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a sweeping cityscape scenery shot featuring Buckingham Palace and the Victoria Memorial in London. The grand, neoclassical palace stands in the background under a partly cloudy sky, while the ornate, white marble Victoria Memorial, topped with a gilded bronze statue of Victory, is positioned centrally. Manicured gardens with vibrant red flowers and lush green lawns are in the midground, with a road and trees bordering the iconic location. There is no main subject, as the camera's broad perspective is intended to capture the expansive and iconic atmosphere of the location, emphasizing the scale and grandeur of the environment rather than focusing on a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor, daytime view captures Buckingham Palace in London under a partly cloudy sky. Initially, the pale-stone facade of the palace is visible to the left but later shifts to the center as the camera moves. The white marble Victoria Memorial, topped with a golden winged statue, remains central in the composition. A line of dense green trees is initially in the background and later extends to the midground. The midground contains manicured green lawns and beds of red flowers, bordered by a road with some light traffic. During the camera movement, some white columns pass by in the foreground. The perspective shifts significantly throughout the video. A white logo is present as an overlay in the bottom-right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot with no main subject, focusing on the environment. Initially, Buckingham Palace is positioned in the background on the left, with the Victoria Memorial in the center of the middle ground. Manicured gardens and a sign occupy the foreground across the bottom of the frame, while trees are visible in the right background. The camera, positioned at eye-level, then tracks to the right. During this movement, the palace shifts towards the center of the frame, and the memorial remains centrally located. A road and fence posts in the immediate foreground move from right to left, while the gardens remain on the left side of the frame. A logo is overlaid in the bottom-right corner throughout the shot.",
