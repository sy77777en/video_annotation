    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From an over-the-shoulder perspective, a crowd of spectators watches a competition. In the midground, a man with short, dark hair flies forward on a broomstick, wearing a green robe over a green shirt. He flies from the midground to the foreground and exits the frame from the top left foreground at the end. To his left, another person on a broomstick is clad in reddish-brown robes. This person soon separates from the first person and exits the frame from the right side. The scene is viewed from behind several spectators in both the foreground and midground. On the right, a person with short, white, curly hair wears a black, pointed hat and a dark-brown garment. Next to them and in front of them, other spectators are seen mostly from behind and the rear side, with most of them also wearing a dark-colored, pointed hat. In the lower left, the rear side and top of a person's head with a dark, pointed cap is visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This daytime scene is viewed from behind spectators in the stands, looking down onto a large, oval-shaped stadium with a green grass field marked by white lines. The background features tall borders constructed with a checkered pattern of grey and white squares and sections of brown hues. Several figures on broomsticks are in motion above the field; one in a green uniform and one in a reddish-brown uniform are close to each other on the left side initially, then separate, while others in red and green are blurred in the midground and background. The spectators in the foreground and midground are seen mostly from behind and the rear side, with most of them wearing dark-colored, pointed hats. The entire scene is cast in a desaturated, greenish-grey light.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: A crowd fills the stadium, watching a broomstick competition. The camera is set over the shoulders of two spectators in the back row, framing the action through their viewpoint. The heads of many spectators occupy the lower half of the frame, while the contestants are mostly fully visible in the middle and upper parts of the frame. Two figures in flight\u2014one in green robes and the other in brown\u2014speed toward the camera. The scene ends with them soaring upward and out of frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This over-the-shoulder shot is framed from behind spectators who occupy the foreground and middle ground across the lower half of the frame, with a white-haired person in the right foreground and another spectator's head in the bottom left. The camera looks down from a high angle onto a stadium field in the middle ground, with the stadium structure visible in the background. Initially, two main figures on broomsticks are in the middle ground above the field; one in green is left of center, and one in reddish-brown is to his right. Both figures fly from the middle ground toward the foreground. The green-robed figure moves diagonally toward the top left, exiting the frame from the top left foreground, while the reddish-brown figure separates and moves toward the right, exiting from the right side of the frame. Other smaller figures on broomsticks are visible in the middle ground and background throughout the shot. The camera is positioned at the level of the foreground spectators.",
