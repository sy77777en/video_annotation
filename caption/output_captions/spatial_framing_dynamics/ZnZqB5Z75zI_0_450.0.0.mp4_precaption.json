    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on a fuzzy, yellow-and-black bee hovering over a white daisy with an orange center. A person's feet, clad in dark gray high-top sneakers and shiny black pants, step onto the pavement near the flower. The focus then shifts to a young man with fair skin and short, silver-white hair. He stands on the side of the road wearing a silver leather jacket over a black graphic t-shirt and silver-framed sunglasses, holding a small, yellow, oblong snack. To his right, a pale yellow vintage convertible drives by, carrying a driver and at least two passengers in the back seat.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place outdoors during the day on the side of a cracked asphalt road lined with green trees and grass. A white daisy with a yellow-orange center grows on the grassy verge. A person wearing grey high-top sneakers, black pants, and a silver leather jacket stands on the edge of the road. In the midground, a vintage, light-yellow convertible car appears almost stationary in a driving pose.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera starts at ground level, capturing half a flower and a full bee. Then, two feet enter the frame in close-up; the camera moves upward to eye level, and finally, a medium close-up of a man appears on the right side of the frame, with a sports car carrying a seated person on the left.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle close-up, where a bee hovers in the upper-center middle ground above a daisy positioned in the bottom-foreground. A pair of feet in sneakers then enters from the right, landing in the middle ground behind the flower. The camera tilts upward, following the person's legs on the right side of the frame as a vintage car appears in the left middle ground. The shot settles at eye level, framing a man in a medium close-up on the right foreground, while the convertible, with passengers inside, occupies the left middle ground, set against a background of trees.",
