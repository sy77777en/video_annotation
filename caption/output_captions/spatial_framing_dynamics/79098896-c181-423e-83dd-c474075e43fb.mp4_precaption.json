    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a nature scenery shot, capturing a disorienting, spinning view looking directly up through a dense forest canopy where the dark silhouettes of tall trees and their branches blur into a circular vortex against a light blue, clear sky. There is no main subject because the focus is on creating an atmospheric and immersive experience of the environment. The rapid rotation abstracts the individual trees, emphasizing the scale of the forest and a feeling of vertigo rather than highlighting a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a worm's-eye view looking directly up, the scene captures a forest canopy during the daytime. The view is spinning rapidly, creating a significant circular motion blur. The dark silhouettes of tall trees and their foliage are set against a bright, light blue sky, with the rotational effect causing both elements to spin around the concentric circles emanating from the center.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a forest canopy. The camera is positioned at a very low angle, pointing directly up from the ground level. The dark silhouettes of tall trees and their foliage occupy the foreground and middle ground, filling the frame, while the bright sky is visible in the background through the gaps. The entire scene is in a state of rapid, continuous rotation around the central point of the frame. This movement causes the static trees and sky to blur into concentric, circular streaks that emanate from the center, with elements at the periphery of the frame appearing to move faster than those closer to the point of rotation.",
