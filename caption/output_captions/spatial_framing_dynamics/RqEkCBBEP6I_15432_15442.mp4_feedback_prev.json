    "pre_caption": "In a third-person, over-the-shoulder perspective, the video maintains a medium shot of a man who begins in the bottom left of the frame and moves forward into the center. He walks along train tracks that recede from the foreground at the bottom of the screen toward the background. The scene is framed by rocky tunnel walls on the left and right. In the middle ground, a work light stands on the right, near bloodstains and an evidence marker on the ground. Yellow tape and a metal barrier cross the path from left to right in the middle ground. A translucent, shadowy figure flickers into view, standing stationary in the center of the frame and positioned in the middle ground, deeper in the scene than the main character. The camera follows the man's forward progression at his level. UI text is fixed in the foreground at the bottom left, with a HUD in the bottom right and subtitles at the bottom center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a third-person perspective, the video follows a man with medium-length, dark, wavy hair as he walks through a dark, misty tunnel. He is wearing a dark, long-sleeved jacket and has a bag strap slung diagonally over his left shoulder. He holds a flashlight in his left hand and a handgun in his right hand. Intermittently appearing in the path ahead of him is a translucent, shadowy, hooded figure of a person. This second figure is a dark, indistinct silhouette that stands still before vanishing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot framing the character from the hip up follows them walking through a dark, collapsed tunnel. The environment is filled with a thick, green-tinted fog illuminated by portable work lights, revealing rough, rocky walls and debris from the cave-in. Train tracks run along the ground, which is marked with red bloodstains and small, numbered evidence markers. Yellow tape with black \"DO NOT CROSS\" lettering is strung across the path, alongside metal crowd control barriers and an orange traffic cone. In the foggy distance, a translucent, shadowy figure flickers into view. Overlays are present on the screen: in the bottom left corner, white text reads \"COLLAPSED TUNNEL\" and \"MISSING FBI AGENT,\" accompanied by a \"PLOT BOARD\" label with a small rectangular icon beneath them; at the bottom, subtitles display dialogue; and in the bottom right, a heads-up display shows an ammunition count and other icons.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a third-person perspective game video. The camera follows the character from behind, showing him in a medium shot while leaving more space for a wide shot of the scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
