    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures an urban park scenery with a quiet, summery setting. The camera's slow, ascending pan is designed to establish the environment and atmosphere rather than focus on a specific subject. The shot begins low across a wide gravel field with a white soccer goal and a chain-link fence, effectively setting the stage. As the camera ascends, it gradually reveals a street lined with parked cars and distant mountains on the skyline, while a multi-story brick apartment building is visible from the start, nestled behind large, leafy green trees.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone slowly ascends over an empty sports field covered in light-colored gravel. As the drone rises, a white soccer goal, initially positioned in the midground, gradually shifts to the foreground, just before a chain-link fence that borders a street with parked cars. The scene is framed by large, leafy green trees. In the background, a multi-story brown brick apartment building is visible, and as the camera continues to rise, distant mountains appear under a partly cloudy blue sky during the daytime.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot of an urban park begins with a low-angle view, where a light-colored gravel field occupies the entire foreground and the bottom half of the frame. A white soccer goal is positioned in the center middle ground, situated before a chain-link fence that extends horizontally across the scene. Behind the fence, parked cars, a multi-story brick apartment building, and large trees on the left and right fill the middle ground. As the camera slowly ascends, the gravel field recedes toward the bottom of the frame, and the soccer goal and fence shift lower. This upward movement reveals more of the apartment building and trees, while distant mountains emerge in the upper background, above the building and below the blue sky. The camera's position transitions from a low angle to a higher aerial viewpoint looking over the park.",
