    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated boy with pale skin and large, tired-looking eyes with reddish circles underneath is shown in bed. He has dark brown hair styled in a bowl cut with a very short, shaved undercut on the sides and back. He is wearing a light green t-shirt, grey shorts, and white socks. Visible on both of his knees are red scrapes. Also on the bed are three green leaves: two on the white pillow and one on the bedsheet.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an animated bedroom, a bed with light-colored sheets and a white pillow is positioned next to a wooden nightstand. On the nightstand sits a brown, vintage-style alarm clock. The scene, illuminated by soft light, shows an animated boy with dark hair in the bed, wearing a green t-shirt and grey shorts. Three large, green, five-leaf clover-like leaves are on the bed\u2014two on the white pillow and one on the sheets. The boy sits up briefly before falling back onto the sheets and yawning.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a high-angle medium shot of an animated boy lying in the center of a bed, his head on a pillow in the middle ground. A nightstand is positioned in the background on the left, while the bed covers occupy the foreground. The shot then transitions to a full shot as the boy sits up in the center of the frame. As he sits, three green leaves appear in the middle ground: one on the pillow to the top left and two on the bedsheet to the middle right. Finally, the boy falls backward onto the bed, his body landing slightly to the right of the center, as the camera maintains its high-angle perspective.",
