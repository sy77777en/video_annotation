    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a perspective behind a crowd, a woman with light-colored hair interspersed with brown hair, tied back in a ponytail, and wearing a dark jacket is visible on the right. To her left stands a man with short dark hair, also in a dark jacket. They are part of a larger group of people, including several women with dark hair facing away from the camera and a woman wearing a pinkish hooded jacket with the hood up. In the distance, partially obscured by mist, the immense, dark gray, and rocky-textured form of a giant reptilian monster emerges. The creature's massive upper body and head, featuring a scaly texture and dorsal plates along its back, become more defined as the view shifts upwards.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a street-level perspective looking down a wide city avenue, a scene unfolds during the daytime under a grey, overcast sky. The wet street is flanked by modern, multi-story buildings and lush green trees. In the foreground and midground, the backs of several people are visible, while cars are oriented in various directions; some face toward the camera, and others are obscured by people. In the distance, shrouded in a plume of dust and mist between the buildings, a colossal, dark figure with a craggy, rock-like texture slowly rises into view. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text \"GODZILLA (2014)\". Later in the video, another overlay appears in the upper center of the frame, featuring light-colored uppercase text inside a blue box, with only the letters \"APTER\" fully visible.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera begins with a medium shot of several people seen from behind, with a monster faintly visible in the background. Then, the camera tilts up, turning into a full shot of the monster.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a medium shot from behind a crowd of people, with the camera positioned at their level. A woman is in the right foreground, and a man is in the left foreground, while other people and cars occupy the foreground and middle ground across the frame. Trees line the left and right sides of the scene in the middle ground. In the center background, between tall buildings, a large monster is partially visible. The camera then tilts upward, causing the people in the foreground to shift toward the bottom of the frame. This movement reframes the scene into a full shot of the monster, which rises to dominate the center background, its upper body and head becoming the central focus in the upper portion of the frame.",
