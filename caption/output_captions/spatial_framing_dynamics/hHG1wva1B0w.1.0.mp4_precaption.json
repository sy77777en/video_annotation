    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A collection of various items is laid out on a flat, gray surface. On the right sits a dark brown, rectangular doctor's-style bag with a top handle and metal rivets. In the center of the arrangement are a pair of light gray gloves, with a plain white mask to their left. The mask has two eye holes and a mouth hole, and an ice pick with a red handle is stuck through its left eye hole. Surrounding the gloves and mask are a coil of thick yellow rope, a messy pile of thin silver wire, and a small black flashlight. To the far left, a long, gray metal crowbar is on the flat, gray surface, and a crumpled black trash bag is present further to the left, below the surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit interior with a greenish tint, a collection of items is laid out on a gray, flat surface, possibly the console of a vehicle. To the right sits a brown, leather-like bag with a handle. In the center, there is a white mask with two eyeholes and a mouth hole, a pair of light-colored gloves, a black flashlight, a coil of yellow rope, and a tangle of silver wire. A small tool with a red handle, resembling an ice pick, is stuck through one of the mask's eyeholes. Throughout the shot, a long metal crowbar and a black plastic bag remain visible on the left side of the arrangement. The camera moves with an arcing, moving, and tilting motion.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot from a high angle, a collection of items is arranged on a gray surface that occupies the middle ground of the scene. A brown bag is positioned in the top right, while a white mask, gloves, a flashlight, rope, and wire are clustered in the center. In the bottom left, a crowbar rests on the surface, with a black trash bag visible in the foreground below it. The camera performs a slow, arcing movement to the right while simultaneously tilting down and moving slightly forward, shifting the perspective. This motion brings the crowbar on the left more fully into the frame and offers a closer, more angled view of the central items by the end of the shot.",
