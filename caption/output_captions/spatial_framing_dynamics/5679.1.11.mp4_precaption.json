    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with brown skin, a short dark beard, and a mustache is shown from a low, extreme fisheye lens perspective. He wears a blue, knitted balaclava that covers his head, leaving an opening for his eyes, nose, and mouth. He is dressed in a white t-shirt and light-wash blue jeans. Seated on the stair steps, he looks directly at the camera and holds his hands up to his face, forming a triangle shape with his index fingers and thumbs, which frames his mouth.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This scene is captured from a low-angle, fisheye perspective inside a residence, on what appears to be a wooden staircase. The walls are covered in light-colored wood paneling that curves dramatically due to the lens distortion. A wooden handrail is visible on the right, following the curve of the wall. On the left wall hangs a colorful piece of art composed of various color blocks, including blue, green, yellow, red, and brown. The entire view is contained within a circular frame, bordered by a dark vignette. A person in a blue crocheted mask is squatting in the center of the composition, looking toward the camera.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A full shot, captured from a low-angle fisheye perspective, shows a man squatting in the center foreground. He looks down at the camera, with his hands held up in the extreme foreground to form a triangle that frames his mouth. The wooden walls and staircase occupy the middle ground, curving around the subject due to the lens distortion. A colorful piece of art is visible on the upper left wall, and a wooden handrail follows the curve of the wall on the right. The entire scene is presented within a circular frame with a dark vignette, and the camera is positioned below the subject.",
