    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a mountain landscape, featuring a grassy slope in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. This view is flanked by two large rock cliffs in the middle ground on the left and right, which descend into a forested valley. Distant mountains are visible in the background at the center. A person then enters the frame from the bottom center, establishing a wide shot of the subject. The camera is positioned above the person, who is seen from the back as they walk away from the camera, moving down the foreground slope toward the valley in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a person with shoulder-length, platinum blonde hair as they walk into the bottom of the frame from below. The person, seen from the back, wears a dark, possibly black, backpack and moves away from the camera, descending a grassy, wildflower-covered slope.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds from a high vantage point on a grassy, flower-strewn slope, looking down into a deep mountain valley. The view is framed by two immense, steep rock cliffs that descend sharply into the valley below. The valley floor is a mix of green meadows and a dense forest of evergreen trees. In the distance, beyond the opening of the gorge, other mountain peaks rise against a bright, overcast sky. A person with a backpack is seen from behind, walking down the grassy slope toward the valley.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
