    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium close-up of a man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. A pale yellow and ochre wall occupies the background, with a sloped concrete surface visible in the bottom right corner. As the man bends forward at the waist, the camera pulls back, smoothly transitioning into a full shot that reveals his entire body. In this final framing, the man remains in the center of the frame, now bent over, with the sloped ground occupying the lower portion of the scene. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with shoulder-length dark hair, a mustache, and a beard is featured in the video. He wears a blue ribbed beanie with a small yellow and black \"VANS\" logo patch on the front, a long-sleeved black crewneck sweatshirt with a small white \"VANS\" logo on the left chest, and black pants. He is initially seen looking down and then bends forward at the waist, lowering his hands toward the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors beside a large wall primarily painted in pale yellow, with the lower section in ochre, adding a subtle contrast to the scene. The ground is a sloped concrete surface with patches of green moss and some scattered dry leaves, indicating a slightly weathered environment. The lighting suggests daytime with natural, even illumination. A skateboard with a dark deck and white wheels is present, and as the camera shifts, it reveals a figure standing on the skateboard, smoothly gliding across a flat surface. No overlays, text, or digital elements are visible in the scene. The overall setting is urban and minimal, with the wall and sloped pavement as the main architectural features.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
