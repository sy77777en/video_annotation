    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel-art video game scene, a player character with short, gray hair, a red shirt, and blue pants is shown. The character is situated on a farm that features a small wooden house, a large red barn, and an adjacent stone silo. A distinctive tree with a full canopy of purple blossoms stands near the barn and silo. The surrounding landscape is composed of green grass, dirt paths, various types of trees, and bushes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, the scene is set in a vibrant, pixel-art rural landscape during the late afternoon. The environment consists of lush green grass, patches of sandy dirt, various types of trees, and leafy bushes, with two bodies of water along the bottom edge. Initially, only one body of water is visible in the bottom center and bottom right, but soon the other body of water comes into view from the lower left, and the first body later goes out of view. A character with white hair and red clothing moves from a grassy clearing, initially with a small wooden cabin on the far right, and proceeds north along a dirt path. As the camera follows, it moves upward while occasionally shifting left and right to reveal a large red barn with yellow crops visible in the front and side, a tall cylindrical stone silo with a red conical roof, and at least three prominent trees with purple blossoms partially visible, with one located near the silo. Overlays are visible on the screen: the top right corner displays the in-game date, time, and currency; the bottom center features a toolbar with various tools and items; the bottom left shows temporary notifications for collected resources, and the bottom right has another elongated overlay with \"E.\"**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a top-down perspective, the scene opens with a player character positioned in the center of the frame, standing in a grassy middle ground. A small wooden house is visible in the top right background, and a body of water occupies the bottom right foreground. After briefly clearing the area, the character moves from the center towards the top of the frame. The camera pans upward to follow, revealing a large red barn and an adjacent stone silo in the top right, which replace the small house in the view. Simultaneously, a tree with purple blossoms appears near the silo, a new body of water enters the frame from the bottom left, and the original body of water exits from the bottom right as the character proceeds along a dirt path toward the top of the screen.",
