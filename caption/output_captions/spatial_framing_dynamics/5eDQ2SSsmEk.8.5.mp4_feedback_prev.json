    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of electronic equipment from a level perspective. In the left foreground, a blurred object partially obscures the view. The middle ground is dominated by the electronic devices. A large CRT monitor is positioned on the left side of the frame, with a black pouch resting on its top left corner. To its right, in the center-right of the frame, a smaller monitor displays a fluctuating waveform. A radio transceiver sits atop this smaller monitor, while another screen with a fluctuating blue waveform is visible at the bottom right. In the background, a blurry, blue-lit, rainy scene is visible through a window in the top left corner. The camera remains static throughout, with the only movement being the changing numbers on the radio's display and the fluctuating waveforms on the screens.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a collection of electronic monitoring equipment in a dark, blue-lit environment. In the center, a vintage-style CRT monitor with a dark casing shows glowing cyan text that reads, in part, \"ROBBERY IN PROGRESS\" and \"UNITS... THE SCENE\". Next to it on the right is a smaller, beige-cased monitor, possibly an oscilloscope, which displays a fluctuating white waveform on its black screen and has a green power indicator light. A black radio transceiver with a digital display showing changing orange numbers sits atop this smaller monitor. On the far left, a black pouch is partially visible, resting on the larger monitor.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, indoor setting with a cool blue ambiance, an assortment of electronic equipment is arranged. A vintage-style CRT monitor with a dark casing displays glowing cyan text that reads, \"ROBBERY IN PROGRESS\" and \"ALL UNITS TO THE SCENE.\" Next to it, a smaller monitor displays a fluctuating white waveform, and beneath it, another screen shows continuously fluctuating blue waveforms. Positioned above this screen is a device with an orange digital display showing changing numbers, alongside other lit indicators. The scene is illuminated by the glow from the various screens, a small green power light, and additional light from the outdoor night setting. A black pouch rests on top of the left monitor.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up of a scene inside a car on a rainy night, where electronic devices are being used for monitoring. In the foreground, a blurred seat is visible on the left side, while the electronic devices occupy the center of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
