    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, a vaulting horse and a large landing mat occupy the foreground on the left. A young woman stands observing in the middle ground on the right, with a long runway extending behind her into the background. Another young woman, the main subject, begins in the background on the right and runs towards the camera along the runway, moving into the middle ground. She then performs a vault, launching herself over the horse positioned in the middle ground left of center, and travels through the air towards the foreground before landing on the mat in the bottom left of the frame. The camera remains stationary and at the subjects' level throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a young woman with light skin and blonde hair tied back, who is dressed in a black leotard. She is shown running down a long runway and performing a handspring vault over a red and blue vaulting horse, landing on a large blue mat. Standing to the side and observing her is another young woman with long, dark hair and medium-dark complexion, wearing a turquoise long-sleeved top and light gray sweatpants, with her arms crossed. In the far background, a few other young women in leotards are visible, standing in a line.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a long, narrow section of a gymnastics facility, characterized by white and gray cinder block walls and a green runway floor featuring a long, narrow, light blue mat. In the midground, a red and blue vaulting horse is positioned next to a large blue landing mat in the foreground. Along the left wall, several national flags, including those of Croatia, Israel, and Canada, are hung in a row. The ceiling features exposed pipes and fluorescent lighting. On the left, a single closed bay door lines the runway, while a person in a teal sweatshirt stands watching in the right foreground. Additional gymnastics equipment is present from the foreground to the background on the right side. An American flag is visible in the right background. During the scene, a gymnast in a black leotard runs along the light blue mat and performs a flip over the vaulting horse.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
