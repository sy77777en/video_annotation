    "pre_caption": "Three computer-generated objects are arranged horizontally in the middle ground against a dark background, viewed from a high-angle, top-down perspective. On the left side of the frame, a patch of green land with a fence and a small white animal is displayed. In the center, a green sphere is positioned. On the right, a patch of striped green land is shown. As the video plays, text labels appear in the top left and top right of the frame, positioned directly above the corresponding patches of land. The spatial arrangement of all objects remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents three computer-generated illustrations on a dark background. On the left, an irregularly shaped patch of green land is labeled \"Pasture\" in a light green font. This area is enclosed by a gray, wooden-style split-rail fence and contains a small, white, four-legged animal resembling a sheep. On the right, another patch of green land, labeled \"Lawn\" in the same font, is shown with alternating stripes of light and dark green grass, characteristic of a mown lawn. Positioned in the center, between these two illustrations, is a simple, solid green sphere with subtle shading.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid dark background, three green objects are displayed. On the left, a floating patch of green land is enclosed by a wooden fence and contains a small white figure. In the center is a simple green sphere. To the right, another floating patch of green land is marked with lighter green stripes, resembling a mowed lawn. As the video progresses, a light green text overlay appears, labeling the left patch \"Pasture\" and the right patch \"Lawn.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
