    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pixelated video game character, seen from a top-down perspective, has black hair and wears a yellow and green tunic with a brown hat. The character is in a rectangular garden plot containing two columns of fantastical, fully grown plants. These include red, bulbous plants; blue, glowing, flower-like plants; and orange, leafy plants. The character harvests all the plants, causing them to disappear and leave behind empty tilled soil. Afterward, the character plants new seeds, which appear as small green sprouts in the plot. The scene also displays video game interface elements, including health bars, a minimap, an inventory bar, and features motion controls.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows a scene in a dark, cavernous area illuminated by numerous torches. On the left is a wooden deck or structure, bordered by a body of dark water, while another body of dark water is situated on the center-right side of the screen. In the center is a rectangular plot of tilled soil where a character harvests two columns of colorful plants\u2014some are glowing blue, while others are red and orange. As the character collects them, the plants vanish, and a \"+1 gardening\" overlay text briefly appears. The character then replants only a small portion of the plot with seeds, which sprout into small green shoots. The scene includes several overlay elements: in the top-left corner are health and status bars; a mini-map is in the top-right; an inventory hotbar is at the bottom-center; and controller button prompts are in the bottom-right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a fixed, top-down perspective, a character is positioned in the center of the frame, standing within a rectangular garden plot in the middle ground. A wooden structure occupies the top-left portion of the frame, while bodies of dark water are visible in the top-center and center-right areas. The character moves down the right side of the central plot, and the plants in that column vanish as they pass over them. A text overlay briefly appears in the center-left of the frame. After reaching the bottom of the column, the character moves to the top-right corner of the plot and then moves down its right edge again, causing small green sprouts to appear on the tilled soil. Throughout the scene, UI elements remain stationary, with status bars in the top-left corner, a minimap in the top-right, an inventory bar at the bottom-center, and controller prompts in the bottom-right.",
