    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a bird\u2019s-eye view, a woman with light skin and blonde hair, dressed in a white outfit, is sitting on a chair. In front of her is a green round table with a yellow rim around its edge, appearing as if it is on fire. In the upper right, a second person is partially visible from the waist down, standing and wearing a white t-shirt and gray shorts.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a bird's-eye view and transitions to a high-angle perspective. The scene is set in a room with a black and white checkered floor. In the top-left corner of the frame, a green round table is enhanced with a yellow flame-like special effect around its edge. A band-shaped red glow, added in post-production, casts a light across the scene. A person in a white outfit is seated on a chair looking up, while another person stands partially in view. The scene has a grainy, vintage aesthetic and is framed vertically by black bars on the left and right sides.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "From a static, high-angle, bird's-eye perspective, the video presents a full shot of a scene set on a black and white checkered floor that occupies the entire background. In the middle ground, a woman is seated on a chair in the bottom-left quadrant, looking up toward the camera. Directly in front of her, a green table with a yellow flame effect is located in the center of the frame. In the top-right quadrant, a second person is partially visible standing in the middle ground. A band of red light, an added effect, moves horizontally from right to left across the middle ground. Another chair is visible in the background in the top-left corner. The camera remains positioned directly above the subjects throughout the shot.",
