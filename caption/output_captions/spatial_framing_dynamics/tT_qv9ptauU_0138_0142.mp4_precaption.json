    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a medium shot of a woman with light skin and long, wavy, light-brown hair, who has visible marks and bruises on her face. She is wearing a dark, heavy coat over a knitted scarf and is seated while playing an acoustic guitar. The camera's focus then shifts from the woman to two men standing in the dimly lit background. The man on the left wears a dark coat with a light-colored scarf, while the man beside him wears a dark coat with snow on his shoulders and hands. They are standing close together, with one of them pouring tea for the other. As the focus changes, the woman turns her head to the left side of the frame and looks back at the two people in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Inside a dimly lit, rustic wooden cabin at night, constructed with rough-hewn logs and wooden plank floors. The scene is sparsely furnished, with shelves in the background holding various bottles and goods, and snowshoes hanging on a wall. Near a window showing the dark exterior, two figures stand in the background. In the shadowed foreground, a person with long, wavy hair sits playing a light-colored acoustic guitar. The focus shifts from the person in the foreground to the figures in the background. Briefly, the white text \"The Hateful Eight\" appears in the top-left corner of the frame before fading away, and a white circular icon is present in the top right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a woman playing a guitar, positioned in the center-right foreground. In the background, two men are visible standing in the center-left middle ground. The focus then shifts from the woman to the men. As this happens, the woman turns her head to the left, and the shot becomes a full shot of the two men, who are now the in-focus subjects in the center-left middle ground. The woman becomes an out-of-focus element occupying the bottom-right foreground. Throughout this focus pull, the camera remains at the subjects' level.",
