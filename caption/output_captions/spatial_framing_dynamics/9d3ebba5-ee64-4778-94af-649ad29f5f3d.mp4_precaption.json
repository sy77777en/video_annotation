    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with light skin and dark hair is shown in a tilted, dynamic pose. He is wearing a white t-shirt layered under a grey and white patterned cardigan, paired with blue jeans and black shoes. Various items appear suspended around him, including a yellow duck-shaped object, a pink donut-shaped object, several orange spheres, and pink heart shapes. A small rectangular framed picture is hung on the wall of the room.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a room characterized by vibrant pink walls. A dark, closed door with a silver handle is set into one wall, while a small rectangular framed picture is positioned on a different wall. The entire view is captured from a rotating and tilted perspective, initially shown inverted, creating an optical illusion. Throughout this disorienting space, various colorful objects, such as a yellow duck, a pink donut, and a reddish-purple disc, tumble and float weightlessly. A person wearing a gray patterned jacket and jeans is seen standing at the center of the frame, adding to the surreal atmosphere.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a full shot of a man. As the camera rolls, the lower part of his legs goes out of the frame, turning into a medium full shot. The camera continues to roll, and it returns to a full shot again.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a tilted full shot of a man in the center of the middle ground, with the camera positioned at his level. In the background, a door is located at the top right of the frame and a picture is at the top center. Various objects, including a yellow duck and a pink donut, are in the middle ground at the top left, while a reddish-purple disc moves across the foreground. The entire frame then rotates clockwise. As it turns, the man's legs move toward the bottom left and partially exit the frame, briefly changing the shot to a medium full shot before it returns to a full shot. This rotation causes the background door to shift to the right side of the frame and the picture to the top left, while the other objects tumble and change their positions within the scene.",
