    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot that immerses the viewer in a cold, arctic environment. The video begins at the water's surface, capturing dark, undulating waves against a backdrop of majestic, snow-covered mountains under a clear, deep blue twilight sky. The perspective then dips below the surface, plunging into the dark, deep teal-colored water where small bubbles float and the surface is visible from beneath as a shimmering, blurry line of light. There is no main subject, as the focus is on creating an atmospheric experience and highlighting the dramatic contrast between the crisp, expansive world above the water and the dark, mysterious realm beneath it. The shot emphasizes the vastness and raw beauty of the natural environment itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a body of dark, rolling water, with a distant view of snow-covered mountains against a clear, deep blue sky at dawn or dusk. The perspective shifts as the camera submerges, transitioning to an underwater view. Below the surface, the water is a dark teal color, with blurry bubbles and light refracting from the bright, moving surface above. The entire scene is characterized by the constant, fluid motion of the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot initially frames a range of snow-covered mountains in the background, positioned across the horizontal center. The sky occupies the top half of the frame, while dark, undulating water fills the bottom half, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. The camera, positioned at water level, then submerges, moving downwards. The perspective shifts to a fully underwater view, where the dark water fills the entire frame. The water's surface is now visible as a bright, blurry line at the top of the frame, with small, out-of-focus bubbles floating in the foreground and middle ground. The camera's final position is at a low angle, looking up from below the surface.",
