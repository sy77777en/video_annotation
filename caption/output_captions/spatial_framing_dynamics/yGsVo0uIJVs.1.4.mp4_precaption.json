    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A deep focus shot captures a fleet of light grey naval vessels moving through dark blue water, each ship clearly visible from the foreground to the hazy horizon. The central vessel features a long hull with a thin green stripe and a multi-level white superstructure topped by two prominent masts equipped with various antennae and radar arrays. In the background, at least seven other similar ships are scattered across the ocean, each distinct and contributing to the expansive maritime scene. A small portion of another vessel's bow is visible in the immediate foreground at the bottom left corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an aerial view of a fleet of ships on the open ocean during the day. The scene is set under a hazy sky, with light reflecting off the deep blue, wavy surface of the water. In the foreground, the bow of a vessel is visible, while in the midground, a light gray naval vessel with a white superstructure and two prominent masts moves through the water. A thin green stripe runs along its hull, and the portion below the waterline is reddish-brown. Several other similar gray ships are scattered across the background at various distances, forming a flotilla.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot from a high angle, showing a fleet of naval vessels on the open ocean. A central ship is positioned in the middle ground at the center of the frame, with several other similar ships scattered across the background. In the immediate foreground, the bow of another vessel is visible at the bottom left. The camera then moves forward, transitioning into a full shot that focuses on the central ship. As the camera advances, this main vessel becomes larger and more prominent in the frame, while the foreground element moves out of view.",
