    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot of a vast, desolate, and snow-covered mountain range under a gray, overcast sky. A heavy fog or mist blankets the scene, obscuring the distance, while soft snowflakes drift down through the air. The focus of the shot is on the immense scale and cold, solitary atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific subject. At the summit of the snow-capped mountain, there is a small house with a gabled roof completely covered in snow. The house features brick-red walls and a small dark red chimney. A warm, golden light emanates from within the house, contrasting with the cold, muted tones of the surrounding landscape and illuminating a faint path leading up the slope.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark and foggy nocturnal setting, a small house with a gabled roof sits atop a snow-covered peak, entirely blanketed in snow. The house features brick-red walls and a small, dark red chimney, emitting a warm, golden glow from within. The surrounding landscape consists of soft, rolling mounds of white snow, partially obscured by thick gray fog. A faint, illuminated path winds up the slope toward the glowing house. Small white specks of falling snow drift through the air, completing the desolate, wintry scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide, high-angle shot of a snow-covered landscape. A small, glowing house sits in the center of the frame, positioned on a mountain peak in the middle ground. A faintly illuminated path begins in the bottom left foreground and winds its way up the slope to the house. The mountain occupies the lower half of the frame, extending from the middle ground toward the foreground. The entire scene is enveloped in thick fog, obscuring the background, while specks of falling snow drift throughout the frame, creating a sense of depth. The camera remains static, looking down on the scene from above.",
