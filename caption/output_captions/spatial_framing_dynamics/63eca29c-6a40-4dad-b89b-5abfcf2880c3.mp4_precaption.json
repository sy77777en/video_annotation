    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a young man with short brown hair, seen from behind as he walks through a school hallway. He is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt, blue jeans, and a dark blue backpack with a brown bottom panel slung over his left shoulder; he raises his right hand in a wave. To the right, a young woman with long brown hair stands in front of the lockers. She wears a white t-shirt, wide-leg blue jeans rolled at the cuffs, and holds a large black tote bag slung over her left shoulder, smiling at the main subject. In the midground and background, other students are present, including a young man with dark, curly hair wearing a red hoodie and light-wash jeans, and a group of young men on the left, one of whom has dark skin and wears a patterned short-sleeved shirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot, framing a character from the hip up, follows him as he walks through a brightly lit indoor school hallway during the day. The long corridor has a marble-like, reflective floor and light-colored walls. Rows of light gray lockers line both sides of the hall, with a doorway visible in the distance. The space is populated with numerous young people, some standing in groups while others walk in different directions. The central character, wearing a backpack, moves forward through the crowd and briefly raises a hand.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a young man is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, walking away from the camera down a school hallway. The camera, positioned at his level, follows him, maintaining this central framing. To his right, a young woman stands stationary in the middle ground against a row of lockers. In the middle ground to the left, a group of other students is gathered. As the central subject walks forward, he briefly raises his right hand to wave, while another student in a red hoodie walks from the background toward the middle ground on the right side of the frame. The hallway's lockers line both sides of the scene, extending from the middle ground into the background, creating a sense of depth that leads to a distant doorway at the center.",
