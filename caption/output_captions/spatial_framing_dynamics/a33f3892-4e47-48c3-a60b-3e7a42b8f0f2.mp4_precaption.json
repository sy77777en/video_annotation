    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with short, light brown hair is shown jumping into a pool. He is shirtless, revealing a slender build, and wears long, black, tight-fitting pants. He is barefoot and is captured mid-air with his arms and legs spread before entering the water feet-first. In the pool, another person, whose details are partially obscured by the water, is visible behind him. To the right, a green, alien-shaped inflatable pool float with a long neck rests on the water's surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor backyard scene is captured on a sunny day, centered around an in-ground swimming pool with clear blue water and a surrounding stone paver patio. Integrated into a decorative brown rock formation at the pool's edge is a short, curved, light blue plastic waterslide. The background is lush with green foliage, including a large weeping willow, various other trees, and potted plants. In the distance, a gazebo and patio furniture are visible. A person jumps from the rockery into the water, near a green inflatable pool toy.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a full shot of a person jumping into the water. As he enters the water, his body becomes obscured, and by the end, it roughly turns into a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject and then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a low-angle full shot, capturing a man mid-air in the top center of the frame against a background of trees. In the foreground, a blue waterslide and a rock formation are positioned in the bottom left and center. The man moves downward, and the shot transitions to a high-angle wide shot of the pool area. In the final framing, the man is in the center of the scene, partially submerged in the pool which occupies the bottom half of the frame. A green inflatable toy is visible in the middle ground to the right, with the pool patio and background foliage filling the top half of the screen.",
