    "pre_caption": "This static, extreme wide shot captures a vast nighttime landscape. The star-filled sky occupies the upper two-thirds of the frame in the background. The lower third of the frame is divided between a dark, silhouetted mountain ridge with trees in the foreground on the left, and the rugged, dimly lit rock formations of a canyon in the middle ground on the right. In the background, positioned in the lower-left center of the frame, a warm glow from distant city lights is visible on the horizon. The camera is positioned at a high vantage point, looking out over the expansive scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot depicting a vast mountain canyon under a clear night sky. The foreground is composed of the dark, silhouetted ridge of a mountain, with a couple of pine trees visible on the left. In the distance, the rugged, rocky formations of the canyon are faintly visible, while a distant city or town casts lights in the distance, and the warm, yellow glow from the low sun illuminates the horizon. The focus of the video is on the immense scale of the natural environment and the serene atmosphere, rather than a specific subject. The expansive, dark blue sky is filled with countless bright stars and the faint, cloudy band of the Milky Way, creating a sense of awe and tranquility.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A nighttime landscape unfolds from a high vantage point, overlooking a vast canyon under a dark, star-filled sky. The Milky Way moves within the upper portion of the scene, with a single, bright celestial object visible on the right, before later moving down below the horizon. In the foreground, the dark silhouette of a ridge with a few trees is visible on the left. The expansive canyon below features dimly lit, rugged rock formations. Far in the distance, the warm, yellow glow of city lights is visible, while the low sun illuminates the horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
