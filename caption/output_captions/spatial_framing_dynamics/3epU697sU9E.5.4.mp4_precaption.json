    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In an airplane cabin, a white man with light brown hair is seated in a large chair, wearing a light-colored collared shirt, a red tie, and dark pants. He is posing as if gesturing with his left hand. Standing and facing him is a second white man with dark hair, dressed in a white collared shirt and a dark, patterned tie. In the foreground, partially obscuring the view, is the side of a Black man wearing glasses, a white collared shirt, and a red tie. A presidential seal is visible on the window shade behind the seated man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside the cabin of an airplane during the daytime, illuminated by bright light from the windows. The interior is furnished with a polished wooden table and upholstered chairs. Beige curtains are partially drawn back from the rectangular windows, one of which features a circular seal on its shade. Several men in shirts and ties occupy the space, appearing to engage in conversation around the table.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot filmed from the subjects' level, the scene is framed from behind the left shoulder of a man in the foreground. In the middle ground, a seated man occupies the center-left of the frame, while another man stands on the right, facing him. A wooden table extends from the center to the right side of the frame in the middle ground. The background consists of the airplane cabin wall with two windows, one of which, located in the center-left behind the seated man, displays a presidential seal on its shade. The spatial composition remains static.",
