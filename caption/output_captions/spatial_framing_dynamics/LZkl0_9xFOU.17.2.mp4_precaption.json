    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A stylized, faceless male figure is depicted sitting down, hunched forward. He has short, brown hair styled with a side part and is wearing a vibrant, multicolored tie-dye t-shirt and dark-colored pants. The figure's skin is pale and completely devoid of any facial features. He is viewed from behind dark, vertical bars.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a dimly lit prison cell with gray cinder block walls and a dark floor. A metal bunk bed with a mesh top bunk stands against the back wall. On the lower bunk, which has a dark, thin mattress and a pillow, a figure in a multicolored t-shirt sits down. As the view pulls back, it is revealed that the cell is being observed through the dark, vertical bars of a locked door.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a faceless figure positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The camera then pulls back, transitioning to a full shot that reveals the figure is sitting on the lower bunk of a bed. This movement also brings a set of dark, vertical bars into focus in the foreground, which frame the entire scene. The figure remains in the center of the frame and the middle ground, with the bunk bed and a cinder block wall visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
