    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a light-skinned man with short, light-colored hair, who is wearing a dark t-shirt. He is shown speaking with an animated expression while facing another man. This second man, who is positioned very close to the first, has a shaved head and a full, dark beard, and is also dressed in a dark t-shirt. He is primarily shown in profile, occasionally turning away from the camera, with his features partially obscured by shadow. The entire scene is heavily saturated with a deep red light, which casts strong shadows over both individuals.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor space is enveloped in a pervasive, deep red light, casting the entire scene in a monochromatic hue and creating a hazy, dimly lit environment. The background is largely undefined due to the darkness, with the exception of a horizontal orange light fixture visible in the upper right. Two men are situated close together within this setting, though one eventually moves out of view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a bearded man is positioned in the left foreground, shown in profile facing right, while another man with light-colored hair is in the center-right middle ground, facing him. A horizontal orange light is visible in the top right background. The bearded man then turns away from the camera and moves out of the frame to the right, leaving the second man as the primary focus in the left-center of the frame, facing right. The camera remains static and at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",
