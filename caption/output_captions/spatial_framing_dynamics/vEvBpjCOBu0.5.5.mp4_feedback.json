    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a natural landscape scenery shot of a desolate, fire-ravaged environment. The focus is on the overall atmosphere of destruction, emphasizing the widespread impact of the fire on the terrain. The ground is a chaotic mix of gray ash, dirt, and countless rocks of varying sizes. Scattered amongst the rocks are large, blackened logs, their surfaces cracked and charred, with some showing exposed, lighter-colored wood underneath. Charred black remains of burnt trees and shrubs fill the scene from the foreground to the background. In the upper right corner of the background, a small patch of unburnt woods and shrubs stands out under the bright sunlight, completing the scene of devastation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting during the day, the ground of a scorched and rocky landscape is shown. The terrain is covered in gray ash, dirt, and numerous stones of various sizes. Several large, blackened, and charred logs are scattered across the scene, with some showing areas of exposed, lighter-colored wood where the bark has burned away. In the background, the bare trunks of burnt trees are visible on a hillside, with a small area of unburnt woods and shrubs in the upper right corner. A small watermark is present as an overlay in the bottom left corner, and the white text overlay reads \"[22]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
