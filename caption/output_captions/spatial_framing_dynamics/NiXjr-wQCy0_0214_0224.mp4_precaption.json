    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A single, spherical water balloon is the focus of the video. The balloon is teal-blue and is covered in a pattern of red, yellow, and light blue splashes, along with the repeated word \"splash!!\" printed in white. The balloon is shown deforming as it hits a surface, releasing a fine mist of water. It then rebounds into the air, regaining its spherical shape while continuing to spray water droplets.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor scene during the day, a small, colorful ball hits a flat, paved surface. As the teal-colored ball, adorned with a pattern of colorful splashes and text, impacts the ground, it flattens and releases a spray of water droplets that catch the light. Utilizing a time ramp effect, the ball then bounces back up into the air, reforming its spherical shape against a soft-focus background of green trees and foliage.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of a water balloon. It then bounces upward, and by the end, only half of it remains visible in the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a water balloon in the center of the frame, resting on a paved surface in the foreground. In the background, out-of-focus green foliage is visible. The balloon flattens upon impact at the bottom-center of the frame, with water spraying up and around it. It then rebounds, moving vertically from the bottom-center towards the top of the frame. As it ascends, it begins to exit the shot, and by the end of the clip, only the lower half of the balloon is visible at the top-center of the frame. The camera remains stationary and positioned at the subject's initial ground level throughout the sequence.",
