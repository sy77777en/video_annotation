    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a diagonally tilted scene, a woman with brown skin and dark hair stands on a wide, white ledge. She is wearing a black, sleeveless, knee-length dress. Her arms are spread out to her sides, and her body is angled across the surface. Below her, against a clear blue sky, are the tops of trees, one with green leaves and another with brownish-orange foliage.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is captured from a severe Dutch angle, creating a disorienting diagonal composition. A large, white architectural structure with a smooth surface occupies the upper right portion of the view, set against a clear, deep blue sky on the left. Below the structure, the tops of trees with green and brownish-orange leaves are visible. A person in a black dress is positioned at the corner of the white structure, lying against its surface with arms outstretched. The scene is brightly lit under a clear sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot with a severe diagonal tilt, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame, standing on a wide, white ledge that serves as the middle ground and cuts across the scene from the top left to the bottom right. In the background, the tops of trees are visible in the bottom left and center of the frame, set against a blue sky that occupies the bottom left quadrant. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
