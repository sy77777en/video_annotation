    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a stylized, dimly lit setting, three statue-like figures of men are depicted. Two figures are positioned close together in the center-right, both rendered in an orange-hue, textured material and wearing uniforms composed of a jacket, trousers, boots, and a cap. The figure on the right is turned slightly to his left, raising his left arm to point upwards. The figure beside him is looking towards the left side, where the first figure is pointing, with his arms held at his sides. A third, identical figure is positioned on the far left, standing with his entire back to the viewer and facing towards the left side of the scene. All three figures have a wireframed, stylized form.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a large, symmetrical indoor hall rendered in a distinct digital style. The entire structure, including a high, coffered ceiling and multiple levels with balconies and arched doorways, is depicted as a semi-transparent, orange-hued point-cloud model against a dark, noisy background. Several warm spotlights illuminate the floor along the central axis, which is covered in a dark, noisy texture. Beside this illuminated area stand two figures in military-style uniforms, while a third figure stands further to the left in the shadows. The figures appear solid with a textured, orange-hued surface. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays \"[9]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot, captured from the subjects' level. In the middle ground, two figures stand close together in the center-right of the frame, positioned within a pool of light on the floor. A third figure is positioned in the middle ground on the far left. The entire scene is framed by the semi-transparent architecture of a large hall, which extends from the middle ground into the background. The high ceiling occupies the top of the frame, while balconies and arched doorways line the left and right sides, creating a sense of depth that recedes towards a dark, empty space in the background.",
