    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man with shoulder-length, wavy, blondish-brown hair, seen in profile as he walks. He wears a dark green, double-breasted military-style jacket with a high collar and brass buttons. He is followed by other men who are dressed in similar dark green uniforms, some of whom wear hats or visors. These other men are depicted in profile, facing the camera, appearing to be in a line or formation with the main subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit, grand interior hall defined by dark wood paneling and a series of large, square, reddish-brown pillars. The space is illuminated by small, warm lights. The camera's view, initially partially blocked by a pillar, reveals a man with blond hair in a dark green, double-breasted uniform walking from left to right, moving past other people in similar attire who are positioned in the foreground and middle ground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene opens as a medium shot with a large, dark pillar occupying the left foreground, partially obscuring the main subject who is positioned in the middle ground. The subject walks from left to right, emerging from behind the pillar to become fully visible in the left-center of the frame. As he moves, the out-of-focus head and shoulders of another person appear in the right foreground, creating depth, while other people in similar uniforms follow the main subject in the middle ground. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, pans slightly to the right to track the main subject's movement.",
