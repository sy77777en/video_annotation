    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an airport scenery shot, capturing a high-speed, point-of-view perspective moving down the centerline of a long runway. The pavement is heavily stained with dark tire marks, and the white runway markings are blurred into streaks by the rapid forward motion. Flanking the runway is a flat, grassy airfield with distant taxiways, all set under a hazy, reddish-orange sky where a single bright light, likely the sun, sits low on the horizon. There is no main subject; instead, the focus is on the immersive experience of speed and the vast scale of the runway environment, making the atmosphere and motion the primary points of interest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene captures a rapid, forward-moving perspective down the center of an airport runway at either dawn or dusk. The asphalt runway is marked with a white dashed centerline and shows significant black tire streaks from previous landings. It is flanked by flat, grassy terrain, with other paved taxiways visible in the distance. The sky is a hazy, reddish-pink, and a single bright light sits low on the horizon to the right. At the bottom of the screen, there is a solid black bar that spans the entire width. Centered above this bar is a line of yellow text reading \"AUS TWR:\". Below this, there are two lines of white text displaying the dialogue: \"Fedex 1432 heavy, Austin Tower, 18L RVR: touchdown 1400, midpoint 600, rollout 1800. 18L, cleared to land.\" The \"RVR:\" portion is highlighted with a bright yellow background, which visually distinguishes it from the rest of the text. This highlight extends to include \"RVR: touchdown 1400,\" and then further to \"RVR: touchdown 1400, midpoint 600, rollout 1800.\" After remaining static for several seconds, the subtitles begin to change: the subtitle section gradually descends, and the image above is pulled down and enlarged until only the runway image remains.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot from a low-angle, point-of-view perspective, positioned in the foreground and moving rapidly forward along the centerline of an airport runway. The runway originates at the bottom center of the frame and recedes toward the center background. A static black bar containing text is fixed at the bottom of the screen. As the camera advances, a yellow highlight on the text expands from left to right. Towards the end, the text bar moves down and out of the frame, while the runway image above it simultaneously zooms in and shifts downward to occupy the entire screen. The camera is positioned just above the runway.",
