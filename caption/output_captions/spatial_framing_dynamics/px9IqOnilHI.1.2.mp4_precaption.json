    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pair of dark-skinned hands holds a silver Sony PlayStation DualShock 2 controller from a top-down perspective. The person's left thumb is positioned on the left analog stick, while the right thumb is actively pressing the down arrow button on the right side of the controller. The controller features the standard PlayStation button layout, with \"SONY\" and \"PlayStation\" logos in the center, and \"DUALSHOCK 2\" printed above the D-pad. The red \"ANALOG\" light, located between the two sticks, is illuminated.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead POV shot captures a pair of hands holding a light gray Sony PlayStation DualShock 2 controller, with blue \"SONY\" and \"PlayStation\" logos and a red light illuminated on the central \"ANALOG\" button. The person's thumbs rest on the left analog stick and the circular face button. The indoor setting is dimly lit with cool-toned light, and the background, which includes the controller's black cable and the faintly visible legs of the seated player, is a blurred and indistinct dark surface. The scene is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static, close-up shot from a top-down perspective, a pair of hands holding a silver PlayStation controller is positioned in the center of the foreground. The controller's black cable loops behind it in the middle ground. The background is a blurred, dark surface, where the player's legs are faintly visible. The hands and controller remain fixed in the center of the frame, which is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom.",
