    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man with long, reddish-brown hair and a thick, matching beard and mustache that has some snow or ice caught in it. He is wearing a white and grey camouflage-patterned ski jacket, a light green helmet with \"pocsports.com\" and \"Be a HERO\" written on it, and large ski goggles with reflective orange lenses and a light green nose piece. He is leaning forward, with his gaze obscured by the goggles and his mouth slightly open. In the midground, another person is skiing, wearing a blue ski jacket with red and yellow stripes, black pants, and a grey helmet.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object, keeping its perspective fixed to that object, captures a scene on a snowy ski slope during an overcast day. The ground is entirely covered in white snow, with sparse, bare trees dotting the background. In the distance, a metal ski lift tower is visible. Several signposts with directional signs, one of which reads \"Eagle Ridge,\" appear on the left side of the frame. Orange cones are placed in the snow. Another skier is visible in the midground, moving down the hill. Additionally, at the beginning of the video, a skier is seen in the right foreground but moves out of the frame shortly thereafter.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a man in ski gear occupies the center foreground, with the camera positioned at his level, creating a point-of-view perspective. As the video begins, the arm of another person is briefly visible in the bottom right foreground before moving out of frame. Another skier is positioned in the left midground, moving down the slope. In the background, a ski lift tower is visible in the top right, with sparse trees scattered across the scene. A signpost stands in the left midground, and several orange cones are placed in the right midground. As the main subject moves forward, the background elements, including the second skier, scroll past him, indicating his movement down the snowy hill.",
