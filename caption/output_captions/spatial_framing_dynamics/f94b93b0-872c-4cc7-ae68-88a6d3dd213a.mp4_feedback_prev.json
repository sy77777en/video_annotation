    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, captured from the subjects' level, showing a central figure in the middle ground, positioned in the center of the frame. This person is flanked by two silhouetted figures in the foreground, one occupying the bottom left and the other the bottom right. As the camera moves forward, following the central figure walking away down a hallway, the two foreground figures move out of the frame to the left and right. This action transitions the shot into a medium close-up that remains focused on the central figure, who stays in the center of the frame as they proceed into the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with very long, straight, blonde hair is seen from the back, walking between two other individuals. The central person wears a dark jacket. The two people flanking them, one on the left and one on the right, are mostly visible as dark, out-of-focus silhouettes, with only their shoulders and the side of their heads being discernible. As the camera moves, the individuals on both sides exit the frame, while the central person, initially appearing as a dark silhouette like the others, becomes clearly visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the view is of a long, narrow indoor hallway. The scene starts with dim lighting, which gradually shifts to moderate lighting as the central figure moves from a shadowed area into a lit section. The hallway is dimly lit by a series of rectangular fluorescent lights on the ceiling, casting a warm, yellowish glow and creating alternating patches of light and shadow. Light-colored walls are lined with closed doors, and a red object, which appears to be a fire hydrant, is mounted on the left wall. The camera follows the central figure, who has long, straight blonde hair, as they walk away down the corridor. Two other partially visible figures in silhouette flank the central figure but eventually exit the frame. Once they do, the video transitions from an over-the-shoulder POV shot to tracking the central figure from behind.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
