    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of people, dressed in rustic, historical-style clothing, are seated in a large wooden cart. In the center, a young man with dark, curly hair and a darker complexion wears a grey tunic, grimacing with his hands slightly raised. To his right, a person with long, light-colored braids, wearing a grey bonnet and tunic, also looks forward with raised hands. Positioned between them is a woman in a brown head covering. To the right of the central young man, another man in a dark green tunic has a focused expression, raising his hands to maintain balance. On the far left, a man in a tan, wide-brimmed hat is seen from the back with his arm raised. At the very back of the cart on the right, a young man in a straw hat and a reddish-brown tunic sits looking towards the others, his hands also raised. All the individuals in the cart have their hands up and open mouths, as if in reaction to an event.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sun-dappled forest during the daytime, a group of people are transported in a large, rustic wooden cart. The structure is made of rough, light-brown wooden poles and planks, lashed together with rope, forming an open-air enclosure. A dense background of green trees and foliage is visible behind the cart. The occupants, wearing simple, earth-toned period clothing and hats, are all seated within the moving conveyance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a medium shot of a group of people in a rustic wooden cart, positioned in the middle ground and filling the frame from left to right against a background of dense green forest. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, tracks alongside the cart as it moves. The shot then pulls back slightly into a wider shot, revealing more of the cart's occupants and structure. In this wider framing, a man in a tan hat is visible on the far left, and a young man in a straw hat is seen in the bottom right, while the central group remains in the middle of the frame.",
