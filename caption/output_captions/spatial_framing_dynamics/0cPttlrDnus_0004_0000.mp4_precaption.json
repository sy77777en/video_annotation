    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an aerial cityscape scenery shot featuring a modern, glass-walled skyscraper with a highly reflective facade that mirrors a distorted view of the surrounding urban environment. In the background, a sprawling city with numerous residential and commercial buildings stretches towards a hazy, mountainous horizon. In the lower-left corner of the midground, a reddish-brown mountain with several white buildings situated on a platform at its summit adds a unique element to the scene. A digital network overlay of thin white lines and small logos is superimposed across the scene. The video lacks a singular main subject, as the focus is placed on the expansive environment to convey the scale and atmosphere of the urban landscape. The reflective building acts as a central visual element, but it serves to interact with and represent the broader cityscape rather than standing as an isolated subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an expansive view of a city from a level angle. In the foreground, a modern skyscraper with a dark, reflective glass facade mirrors the surrounding urban landscape. Beyond the skyscraper, a sprawling city with numerous residential and commercial buildings extends towards distant, tree-covered mountains under a hazy daytime sky. Several white buildings stand on the platform at the top of the reddish-brown mountain. Overlaying the scene is a network of thin white lines connecting small, white and green \"M\" logos scattered across the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static, extreme wide shot of a cityscape. The scene is framed from a high, aerial perspective, approximately level with the top of the main skyscraper. A large, reflective skyscraper occupies the right side of the frame, positioned in the foreground and middle ground. To the left and in the background, a sprawling city stretches across the frame, extending towards a hazy, mountainous horizon. In the bottom-left middle ground, a cluster of white buildings rests on a reddish-brown cliff. A digital network graphic is superimposed over the entire scene in the extreme foreground.",
