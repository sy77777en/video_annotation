    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle, worm's-eye perspective looking directly up into a forest canopy. The dark, silhouetted branches of numerous trees occupy the foreground and middle ground, extending from all edges to fill the majority of the frame and creating a web-like pattern. The bright sky is visible in the background through the gaps in the canopy, primarily in the center and upper portions of the frame. The sun creates a bright lens flare in the top right. The camera framing has a slight, unsteady drift, causing the composition of the branches against the sky to shift subtly, while a reddish light artifact moves slightly along the bottom right edge.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a nature scenery shot capturing a worm's-eye view looking up through a dense forest canopy. The dark, silhouetted branches of numerous trees, laden with irregular dark clusters, likely dense foliage, form an intricate, web-like pattern against the bright, hazy blue sky where the sun flares brightly. There is no single main subject in this shot; the focus is on the immersive environment and the overwhelming scale of the canopy, emphasizing the atmosphere rather than a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a worm's-eye view looking up, the scene captures the canopy of several tall trees against a bright, light-blue sky. The dark, gnarled branches, some with sparse green leaves, are silhouetted by the sun, which creates a bright flare in the upper right and a reddish-pink light leak in the lower right. Scattered throughout the canopy are numerous irregular, dark, dense foliage clusters among the branches. The view has a slightly unsteady and soft-focus quality as the light shifts.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
