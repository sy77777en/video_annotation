    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a low-angle cityscape scenery shot, which later transitions to a worm's-eye view of the sky. The composition is dominated by a vast, clear blue sky, with some ornate, light-colored stone structures and a bridge initially visible in the lower portion of the frame. A string of small, round light bulbs is initially strung across the middle portion of the frame at a slightly tilted angle. Both the structures and the string of lights later go out of view as the camera moves, leaving only the clear blue sky. The shot deliberately lacks a main subject, using the expansive negative space of the sky to emphasize the atmosphere and scale of the urban environment. The focus is on the overall mood and composition rather than a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a low-angle perspective, looking up at a vast, clear blue sky, which transitions to a worm's-eye view. A black string of unlit, round light bulbs is initially strung across the middle portion of the frame at a slightly tilted angle. An ornate, light-colored stone structure with spires is initially visible in the lower center and right portion of the frame. As the camera moves, both the structures and the string go out of view, leaving only the clear blue sky. The video is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom, and a white, geometric logo is overlaid in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide, low-angle scenery shot. Initially, the frame is dominated by a vast blue sky in the background, which occupies the upper and central portions. A string of lights in the foreground stretches diagonally from the bottom left towards the middle of the frame. In the middle ground, the top of an ornate stone structure is visible in the bottom right. A static logo is overlaid in the bottom right corner. The camera then performs a slow upward tilt, causing the string of lights and the stone structure to move down and exit the frame from the bottom. The final composition consists solely of the expansive blue sky, with the logo remaining fixed in its position.",
