    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a split-level marine scenery shot capturing a tranquil bay flanked by a steep, verdant mountain on one side and a lush, tree-covered shoreline on the other. Several sailboats are moored in the distance under a partly cloudy blue sky, and the perspective begins at the water's surface before submerging to reveal the clear, turquoise water and the rocky, algae-covered seabed below. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on the immersive experience of the environment. The shot's purpose is to showcase the serene atmosphere of the bay and the beautiful contrast between the sunlit world above and the quiet, submerged landscape beneath the surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a tropical bay during the day, with the seawater occupying the lower half of the frame. A large, steep, green conical mountain is situated in the upper left corner, while a lush, tree-covered shoreline extends into the upper right. The sky above is blue with scattered white clouds. As the perspective shifts from the rippling surface of the clear, greenish-blue water and dips below, both the mountain and the coastline gradually move out of the frame, revealing a rocky seabed.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot begins with the camera at water level, capturing the rippling surface in the foreground and lower half of the frame. In the background, a large mountain occupies the upper left, sailboats are positioned in the middle ground near the mountain's base, and a tree-covered shoreline extends across the upper right, all beneath a cloudy sky at the top of the frame. The camera then moves downward, submerging completely. This movement causes the waterline to rise, pushing the above-water landscape out of the top of the frame and revealing the underwater environment. The shot concludes with the rocky seabed filling the foreground and middle ground from the bottom of the frame upwards, while the water's surface is reduced to a thin, bright layer at the very top.",
