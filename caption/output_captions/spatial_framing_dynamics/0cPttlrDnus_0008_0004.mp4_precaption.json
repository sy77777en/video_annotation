    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, dominated by a modern, glass-clad skyscraper whose reflective facade distorts the image of a nearby helipad and the surrounding environment. In the background, a sprawling urban area with numerous residential buildings extends towards hazy mountains in the distance, with a notable reddish-brown excavated cliffside visible to the left. The scene lacks a single main subject as the composition emphasizes the vast scale and complex texture of the urban landscape, creating an atmospheric view rather than focusing on a specific entity. Faint white lines and logos are overlaid on the image, forming a network pattern that adds a technological or data-driven feel to the expansive view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a daytime, aerial view of a modern city under a hazy sky. On the right, a tall skyscraper with a dark, reflective glass facade stands prominently. Its surface shows a distorted reflection of the environment, including a red and green helipad on a nearby rooftop. To the left of the skyscraper, several light-colored residential buildings are situated on the edge of a reddish-brown, terraced cliff. In the background, a vast urban landscape with numerous buildings stretches into the distance, bordered by green, tree-covered hills. A network of thin white lines connecting small, white 'M' icons is overlaid across the entire scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, extreme wide shot of a cityscape from a high-angle, aerial perspective. The composition is dominated by a tall, reflective skyscraper positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. To the left, also in the middle ground, several residential buildings sit near the edge of a reddish-brown cliff located in the bottom-left quadrant. A vast urban area fills the background, stretching from the left to the center, with distant, tree-covered hills visible behind it. A digital network of lines and icons is overlaid in the foreground across the entire scene. The camera remains stationary at a high elevation, level with the upper portion of the skyscraper.",
