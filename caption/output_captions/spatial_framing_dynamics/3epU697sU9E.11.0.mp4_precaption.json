    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a hip-level view in a dense urban setting. The central focus is a large, silver, three-dimensional \"FOX\" logo mounted on a gray stone wall, which forms part of a building's plaza. In the background, the glass and steel facades of modern skyscrapers rise into a bright white sky, while a few pedestrians are incidentally present; two men in suits stand on or near a set of stairs on the left, and another man stands nearby on the right. The shot's composition emphasizes the corporate presence within the urban landscape, making the environment and atmosphere the primary subject rather than any specific person or object. A black metal crowd-control barricade is positioned in the immediate foreground, adding to the public, metropolitan feel.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor, daytime scene is set in a modern city, with tall skyscrapers visible in the background. The central focus is a large, silver, three-dimensional \"FOX\" logo mounted on a multi-tiered grey stone wall. In the foreground, a black metal crowd control barrier partially frames the view. A few people are present in the midground, with two men in suits standing on or near the steps on the left, and another standing on the right. The environment includes several trees and green shrubbery, and the bright white sky casts an even light over the entire scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, low-angle shot of an urban scenery. In the immediate foreground, a black metal barricade extends from the bottom right towards the center. The middle ground is dominated by a large, silver \"FOX\" logo mounted centrally on a gray stone wall. A few pedestrians are incidentally present in the middle ground, with two men positioned on the left near a set of stairs and another man on the right. The background is filled with the facades of tall skyscrapers. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly and steadily zooms in, causing the \"FOX\" logo to become more prominent and fill more of the central frame.",
