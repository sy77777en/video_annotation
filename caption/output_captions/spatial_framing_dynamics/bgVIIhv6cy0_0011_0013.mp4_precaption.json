    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with a light skin tone is the central focus, standing with her arms outstretched and a wide smile. She has long, dark brown hair that falls over her shoulders, styled with bangs and a small side braid on one side. She wears a bright yellow, long-sleeved sweater over a fluffy white scarf. Two bracelets are visible on her left wrist. Yellow leaves fall through the air around her. In the background, several other people are visible, including a woman in a brown dress and another in a white outfit. A white SUV, with the partial license plate \"U077\", is parked on the right side of the scene. A tree with yellow leaves is overhead.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor scene unfolds in a hutong on a narrow, gray asphalt street covered with numerous golden leaves during a sunny autumn day. A large tree with vibrant yellow foliage overhangs the scene, and yellow leaves fall through the air. The street is lined with a mix of low-rise, traditional-style buildings with grey roofs, and a taller, modern white building is visible in the background. Bicycles are parked along both sides of the street, and air conditioner units and solar panels are visible on the building to the right. A white SUV is parked on the right side of the street. A woman in a bright yellow sweater and a white scarf stands in the center with her arms outstretched, while other people are visible in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman stands in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, with her arms extended to the sides. Yellow leaves fall throughout the scene, appearing in the foreground, middle ground, and background. A tree with yellow foliage occupies the top of the frame in the middle ground. In the background, other people are visible to the left and right of the central woman, and a white car is parked in the middle ground on the right side. Buildings line the scene in the background on both the left and right. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, subtly moves backward and to the right, slightly altering the composition of the background elements while the main subject remains centered.",
