    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide, top-down shot, a character is initially positioned in the upper-left quadrant of the middle ground, on a dirt path. To the right, a large wooden platform occupies the right half of the frame, also in the middle ground, while a dark, unexplored area fills the left side. Static UI elements are overlaid in the foreground at the top-left, top-right, bottom, and bottom-right corners. The character moves downwards along the path and enters the dark area, which reveals a bright green, glowing ground as they advance. The character continues moving downwards into this newly uncovered space, ending up in the center-left portion of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a top-down, pixel-art video game scene, a character with black hair, a yellow hood, a red shirt, and blue pants transitions from a dirt path into a dark, unexplored area. The interface displays health and energy bars in the top left, a minimap in the top right, an inventory hotbar at the bottom with items like a bow, axe, and fishing rod, and motion controls in the bottom right corner. As the character digs into the dark blocks, they reveal a bright green, glowing land beneath them. The newly discovered area briefly envelops the character in its light, with the shadow of the blocks creating a circular shape during the character's movement.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides, displays a pixel-art scene set within a dark, torch-lit cavern. The environment features brown earthen ground with patches of green grass next to a body of dark water. A large wooden platform, constructed from patterned square tiles, is built over the water and is furnished with one blue bed, chests, a furnace, and an anvil. A small character with black hair moves from the dirt path into the dark, unexplored area near the water, where they dig into the dark blocks. This action reveals the bright green, glowing land beneath the blocks. Overlays are present on the screen: in the top-left corner are red, blue, and orange status bars, along with three icons below them; a mini-map is in the top-right; a hotbar with various items and quantities is at the bottom; and controller button prompts are in the bottom-right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a top-down 2D video game, making it difficult to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
