    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A muscular, light-skinned man with a shaved head is shown upside down inside a jail cell with blue bars. He is shirtless, revealing a well-defined back and shoulders, and is wearing dark-colored trousers. The man is performing a handstand, balancing his entire body weight on his hands, which are placed flat on the dark floor. The cell door has a white label with \"D-8\" and \"4587\" printed on it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit cell, viewed from the outside through a set of vertical, blue-painted metal bars. The cell door has a small white label with the black text \"D-8\" and \"4587\" visible. Inside, the environment is dark, with a shirtless person positioned in a handstand on the gray concrete floor. Strong, directional lighting enters from one side, creating distinct, striped shadows across the ground. Behind the individual performing the handstand, there is a fixed metal structure, likely part of the standard furnishings found in a prison cell.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot of a man doing a handstand, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He is viewed through a set of blue jail cell bars that occupy the foreground, with the cell door visible on the right side of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, then tilts down slightly, transitioning into a medium shot that frames the man's inverted upper body more tightly. He remains centered in the middle ground behind the foreground bars throughout this movement.",
