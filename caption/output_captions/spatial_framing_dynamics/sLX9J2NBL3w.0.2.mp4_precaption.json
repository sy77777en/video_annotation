    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a low-angle perspective, a light-skinned man with short, brown hair is visible through a window. He is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt. He reaches out and pulls two dark, louvered shutters closed. Once the shutters meet, the man is no longer visible in the frame, leaving it unclear whether he turns away from the window or simply steps out of view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Filmed from a low-angle perspective during the day, the scene shows the exterior of a building with horizontal, light-brown wooden plank siding. A person inside leans out of a dark-framed window and gently closes a pair of dark brown, louvered shutters. A checkered curtain is briefly visible inside the window. The scene is evenly lit, highlighting the weathered wood of the building's facade.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video captures a man closing a window from a low-angle perspective. It starts with a medium shot of the man; as the camera pushes in, the man shuts the window, then disappears from the frame, leaving only a medium shot of the window.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle perspective, the video begins with a medium shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame, visible through a window in the middle ground. The window is flanked by two open shutters, one on the left and one on the right, against the wooden exterior of a building that fills the frame. As the camera pushes in slightly, the man pulls the shutters from the sides toward the center. Once the shutters meet and are closed, the man disappears from view, leaving a medium shot focused on the closed window in the center of the frame.",
