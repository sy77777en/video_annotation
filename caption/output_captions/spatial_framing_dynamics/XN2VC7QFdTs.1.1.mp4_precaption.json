    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a bedroom, a middle-aged man with light skin and short blond hair stands facing a woman. He wears a black jacket with a white skeleton rib cage design on the front and removes a white skull mask from his face. The woman has long, dark, wavy hair, a medium skin tone, and wears a dark, sleeveless dress with a scooped neckline, a black choker, and black lace gloves. As they lean in and kiss, she places her right hand, which has a gold bracelet on the wrist, on his chest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a bedroom bathed in warm, soft natural daylight. A wall sconce and a floor lamp with a beige shade are present but not illuminated. The room features light-colored, patterned wallpaper and white wainscoting. In the background, there is a wooden bed with white pillows, a nightstand, and a chair. As the camera pans in a clockwise direction, a large, dark wood wardrobe gradually comes into view from the right and ends up slightly to the right of the center. A man in a black jacket with a white skeleton design removes a white skull mask while facing a woman in a dark dress, and the scene concludes with them sharing a kiss.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a woman stands on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, facing a man positioned on the right. The man, also in the middle ground, removes a mask from his face. As this occurs, the camera pans slightly clockwise, causing the man to shift toward the center-right of the frame and revealing a large wardrobe in the right background. The two subjects then lean in toward the center, with the woman placing her hand on the man's chest as they kiss. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
