    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video begins with a focus on a black table in the foreground, utilizing a shallow depth of field effect. Through a rack focus technique, the frame's focus gradually shifts from the tabletop to reveal a garden scenery shot featuring a small, man-made waterfall. The scene transitions to show water cascading over a wall of large, grey and brown rocks, with a bed of smaller, smooth pebbles separating the rockery from a vibrant green lawn. This method emphasizes the tranquil atmosphere and detailed texture of the rock garden and water feature as a complete composition, rather than isolating a specific element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a daytime outdoor setting, the focus initially rests on a black table in the foreground, utilizing a shallow depth of field effect. The focus then transitions smoothly from the table to a clear view of a landscaped rock garden in the background through a rack focus technique. A small waterfall cascades over a wall constructed from large, gray and brown rocks. At the base of the rock wall lies a bed of smaller, smooth, multi-colored pebbles, which meets a patch of vibrant green grass in the midground. A thin, black vertical element is visible in the foreground throughout the shot. An overlay in the bottom-left corner features a gray, transparent rectangular box with white text that reads: \"ALL SHOTS ON $300 CAMERA MOSTLY HANDHELD AND ALL FOCUS PULLED BY HAND\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
    "pre_caption": "This scenery shot begins as a close-up, with a black table corner in the left foreground in sharp focus, while the green lawn at the bottom and the rock garden in the background are completely blurred. A rack focus smoothly transitions the focal plane from the foreground to the background. The shot resolves into a wide shot of the garden, where a rock wall and a small waterfall on the right side of the frame are now in sharp focus in the background. The green lawn occupies the bottom of the frame in the middle ground, and the black table leg remains as a blurred element in the left foreground. The camera maintains a static, low-angle position throughout, and a text overlay is fixed in the bottom-left corner.",
