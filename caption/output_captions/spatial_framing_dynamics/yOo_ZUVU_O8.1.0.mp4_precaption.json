    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In this black-and-white video, a man with dark, messy hair is shown performing a stunt. He is dressed in a dark suit jacket, a light-colored collared shirt, and dark trousers. Initially, he runs after a moving trolley, holding onto a horizontal pole on its open rear platform. He then launches his entire body horizontally into the air, parallel to the ground, while still gripping the pole, before pulling himself up and onto the trolley's platform.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This black and white outdoor scene takes place during the daytime on a street. A vintage-style trolley car with an open rear platform and steps moves leftward, but the rear of the car remains on the left side of the frame due to the camera tracking its movement. The rapid motion of the trolley causes the background and midground, which consist of simple, wood-sided buildings, as well as some figures and vehicles, to appear blurred. A man in a suit is present on the street, running after the moving vehicle with one hand holding onto the railing of its rear. Subsequently, the man's body floats up and fully enters the car.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot filmed at the subjects' level, the rear of a moving trolley occupies the left side of the frame in the foreground. A man runs from the center-right of the frame in the middle ground, moving left to catch up with the trolley. After grabbing a pole on the trolley's platform, he launches his body horizontally into the air, extending from the left side of the frame toward the center, parallel to the ground. He then pulls himself up and onto the platform, moving from a position outside the vehicle to being fully on the platform on the left side of the frame. The camera tracks the trolley's movement, keeping it consistently on the left as the blurred background buildings and street scroll by.",
