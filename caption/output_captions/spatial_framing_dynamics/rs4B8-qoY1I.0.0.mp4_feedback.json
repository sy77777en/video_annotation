In the middle ground, a small, pixelated character with an atypical color scheme initially stands on a low, mushroom-shaped platform in the bottom center. Flanking this are two taller platforms, one on the left and one on the right, also in the middle ground, with coins resting on them. A small patch of brick blocks is visible in the bottom left corner. In the background, white clouds are positioned in the upper portion of the frame. A heads-up display is overlaid in the foreground across the top of the screen.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixelated video game scene, the character Mario is shown with an atypical color scheme. He is a small figure with a mustache, wearing white overalls and a matching white cap, with a red shirt and red shoes. The scene also contains several tall, mushroom-shaped platforms, which have orange tops with red spots and light pink stems. On these platforms are a few golden-yellow, oval-shaped coins, and two turtles can be seen on one of the platforms. White text is visible at the top of the screen, displaying \"MARIO\" with a numerical score, \"WORLD 4-3,\" and \"TIME\" with a number, alongside a coin icon next to a count.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is an outdoor, 8-bit pixel art environment against a solid blue sky with a few white, puffy clouds. The landscape features tall, thin stalks of varying heights that support flat, mushroom-like platforms. These platforms have orange tops with a pattern of red, circular spots. As the camera pans to the right, a small section of brown brick blocks in the lower left corner moves out of the frame. A character jumps between the platforms, collecting glowing, golden coins. An overlay at the top of the screen displays a heads-up display with the text \"MARIO\" and a score, a coin icon next to a number, the world and level number \"4-3,\" and the word \"TIME\" next to a decreasing number.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
