    "pre_caption": "The video uses a medium shot, framing the man from the hip up as he walks away from the camera along a narrow, unpaved path. The man is positioned slightly off-center to the left in the 2D frame and occupies the foreground in the 3D space, with his back facing the camera. The path extends into the middle ground and background, leading toward a closed double door that appears in the center background as he moves forward. Steep, moss-covered rock walls are visible on the left side of the frame in both the foreground and middle ground, while jagged rock formations line the right side, also spanning the foreground and middle ground. Sparse trees with autumn leaves are scattered throughout the background. The camera maintains a consistent height at the man\u2019s level and follows his movement forward, keeping him in the same relative position within the frame as the background elements gradually shift, revealing the gate at the end of the path.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short, blond hair is seen from behind, wearing a dark, possibly brown, jacket with a light-colored shearling collar and cuffs, along with dark pants. As he walks forward, at the end of the road ahead, a shabby, closed double door appears.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot, framing a character from the hip up, follows him as he walks through a dark, outdoor setting. He moves along a narrow, unpaved path flanked by steep, moss-covered rock walls on one side and jagged rock formations on the other. The scene is set during dusk or an overcast day, with a misty quality in the distance. The surrounding forest consists of trees with sparse, reddish-brown autumn leaves. As the character advances, a dark, imposing gate made of stone and metal comes into view at the end of the path, with several block-shaped decorations adorning its top.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
