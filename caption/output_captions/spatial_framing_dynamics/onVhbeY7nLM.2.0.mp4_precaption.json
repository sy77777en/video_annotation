    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, complex space station or spacecraft is depicted from a perspective looking up from a dark gray, trapezoidal platform that features a grid of rectangular cutouts. In the center, a massive, light gray cylindrical column extends upward, appearing to connect with or hover just above the platform. Flanking this central column are other large, modular components of the structure. At the top left, a white, box-like module with small, dark windows is visible. At the top right, a similar but more complex assembly includes another boxy module and, more prominently, a set of three large, circular engine nozzles. The entire scene is rendered in a monochromatic palette of grays, whites, and deep blacks, with strong, directional lighting creating sharp highlights and shadows against the void of space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a monochromatic scene set in the blackness of space, a huge cylindrical structure is positioned centrally in the frame and extends upward to the top in the foreground. The surrounding environment is filled with complex, industrial-looking components of a space station or large vessel, featuring blocky, gray modules, exposed piping, and a set of three thruster nozzles on the right. The scene is starkly lit, creating high contrast between the illuminated metallic surfaces and the deep shadows. Distant, out-of-focus lights and occasional purple lens flares are visible against the dark backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera and the object are constantly rotating, and the camera's height cannot be determined due to the lack of details.",
    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot is framed from a low-angle perspective, looking up from a large, trapezoidal platform that occupies the bottom foreground. A massive cylindrical column rises from the center foreground into the middle ground. Flanking this column in the middle ground are two large modules: one is positioned at the top left, and another, featuring three engine nozzles, is at the top right. The entire scene undergoes a slow, continuous rotation, causing the platform at the bottom to shift and the upper modules to move across the top of the frame. This movement creates a dynamic lighting effect, with surfaces flashing between bright illumination and deep shadow. The camera's height relative to the subjects cannot be determined, as both the camera and the object are in constant rotation.",
