    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit, circular space, a group of human figures is gathered on a raised platform. All are clad in long, flowing black robes that conceal their individual features. Several of these figures are looking around in panic, while others are falling down one after another. Some figures are lying motionless on the floor in various positions, some face down and some on their backs, with dark stains visible on the ground around them. The standing figures are positioned among and around the fallen ones.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, cavernous chamber with stone architecture, a raised semicircular platform sits at the center. A large, conical beam of blue light shines down from an unseen source, illuminating the platform and creating a glowing blue ring on its floor. The surrounding walls are lined with a grid of recessed squares, and two large numerals \"7\" are visible on pillars to the left. Several figures in long, black robes occupy the platform; some stand while others lie motionless on the floor, where dark red stains are visible. During the scene, multiple standing figures fall to the ground sequentially.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene is captured in a static wide shot from a high angle, looking down upon a circular chamber. A raised, semicircular platform occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground, illuminated by a large, conical beam of blue light that descends from the top of the frame. On this platform, a group of figures in black robes is centrally positioned. Initially, several figures are standing while others are already lying on the ground. During the shot, a standing figure on the right side of the group falls backward, and another figure near the center also collapses to the floor. The remaining standing figures are scattered across the platform. In the background, stone walls frame the scene, with a large numeral \"7\" visible on a pillar to the left. A dark, rocky surface is visible in the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame.",
