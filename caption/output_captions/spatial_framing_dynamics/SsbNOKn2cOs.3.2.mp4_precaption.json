    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a bird's-eye view, a young man with fair skin and short, light brown hair is seen suspended in the air. He wears a dark, short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants. His body is curled forward as he looks down, gripping a thick black rope with one hand, while the other hand is not visible. A harness with light gray and black straps is visible around his waist and attached to the rope, and it appears that a dummy is holding him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye view, the scene looks directly down into a vast, green valley during the daytime. The landscape below is a mix of green and brown vegetation covering rolling hills, with some exposed rocky ground. A narrow, winding path or dry riverbed meanders across the valley floor. A thick black rope descends through the center of the view, with a person in dark clothing, holding by a dummy,  positioned high above the ground. The overall color palette is muted under what appears to be an overcast sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot from a high-angle, bird's-eye perspective, a man is positioned in the top-center of the frame. He is suspended in the foreground, with a black rope extending from his position down through the center of the frame. The background is entirely occupied by a vast valley far below, with a winding path visible snaking from the top right towards the center of the scene. The camera and the subject remain relatively static, emphasizing the extreme depth between the man in the foreground and the valley floor in the background.",
