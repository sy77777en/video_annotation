    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a hospital room setting, a stylized male figure with white, statue-like skin, short white hair, and a white beard lies propped up in a hospital bed. He wears a light-colored hospital gown with a dark, repeating pattern. Facing him, with its back to the viewer, is another stylized figure, also with white skin and short white hair. This second figure wears glasses and a grey top and is seated in a chair, positioned as if in conversation with the man in the bed.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the setting is a hospital room. A monochromatic figure with styled hair lies propped up in a hospital bed with white linens and metal side rails, wearing a patterned gown. In the background, a dark curtain hangs behind the bed, and a wall-mounted unit with electrical outlets is situated in the midground above the headboard. A bedside tray holds a yellow cup, a red apple, and additional food items, including pieces of bread, providing the only distinct color in the otherwise desaturated scene. An overlay in the bottom left corner consistently reads \"[2]\". Additionally, there is another overlay, a blue box with white text \"2000\", which also appears in the bottom left but disappears later in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene is captured in a static full shot from an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. In the foreground, the back of a seated figure occupies the bottom left of the frame. In the middle ground, a second figure lies propped up in a hospital bed that extends from the center to the right side of the frame. To the left of this figure, also in the middle ground, is a bedside tray. The background consists of a dark curtain directly behind the bed and a wall-mounted unit on the upper right. A persistent overlay reading \"[2]\" is visible in the bottom left corner.",
