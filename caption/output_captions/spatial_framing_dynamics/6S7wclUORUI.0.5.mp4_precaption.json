    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a wide, high-angle view, a vast expanse of reddish-brown ground is covered by hundreds of men lying in rows. The men, appearing to be soldiers, are dressed in various 19th-century-style uniforms of grey, blue, and brown, with many showing signs of injury like bandages. A few people move among the prone bodies. A woman wearing a long, full-skirted pink dress and a hat walks down a path between the rows of men. Other men, some in uniform and some in civilian clothes, are also seen walking, with a few carrying wooden stretchers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective that slowly pulls back, a vast, open-air yard with reddish-brown dirt ground is filled with hundreds of men lying in organized rows. The men are dressed in varied clothing and military-style uniforms of muted grays and blues, with some wearing visible bandages. A set of wooden planks runs through the center of the expanse. A few individuals, including a woman in a pink dress and men carrying a stretcher, walk among the prone figures. The setting is illuminated by bright daylight, with simple wooden structures and a fence visible in the background.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle wide shot, a vast expanse of reddish-brown ground is covered by hundreds of men lying in rows, filling the frame from the foreground to the background. A path of wooden planks runs vertically through the center of the scene. In the middle ground, a woman in a pink dress walks along this path away from the camera, while other figures move among the prone bodies throughout the middle ground. Simple wooden structures are visible across the top of the frame in the background. The camera slowly pulls back and slightly upward, transitioning into an extreme wide shot that emphasizes the immense scale of the scene and the number of people within it.",
