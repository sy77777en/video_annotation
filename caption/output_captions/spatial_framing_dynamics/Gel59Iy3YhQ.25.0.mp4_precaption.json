    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a pixel-art character with slate-blue hair, wearing a brown top and pants, who rides a yellow motorcycle and wields a glowing pink sword. Initially positioned on the right side of the scene, the character gradually moves to the left. Several other subjects, rendered in grayscale, are also present. On the left, two characters in gray tactical gear ride gray motorcycles and are shown firing weapons. On the right, another grayscale character and their motorcycle are depicted tumbling and crashing on the road.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video featuring a 2D horizontal-scrolling scene on a multi-lane road running through a tunnel. The gray asphalt road is marked with both yellow dashed and solid lines. The tunnel's curved walls are lined with gray tiles, which appear pink and purple due to light reflection. Horizontal, rectangular light fixtures on the ceiling cast a blue-white glow. Several motorcycles, leaving motion trails, travel from left to right across the screen. Red, pixelated splatters and the wreckage of a dark motorcycle are visible on the road. The scene includes overlay elements: a blue bar and a \"ZL\" icon in the top left corner, a long blue and pink bar at the top center, and a framed set of icons, including a flesh-colored fist with a pink outer frame, in the top right corner.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera captures the players, each represented as an atypical character, in a wide shot from the side with a high angle. There are many players on screen, all in focus. The main subject is the one on a yellow motorbike, while all the other characters appear in gray.",
    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle wide shot from the side, the scene captures several characters on motorcycles within a tunnel. The main subject on a yellow motorcycle begins in the middle ground on the right side of the frame and moves horizontally toward the center. In the middle ground on the left, two other motorcyclists maintain their positions, one in the upper lane and one in the lower lane. A fourth character and their wrecked motorcycle are seen in the middle ground on the bottom right, remaining stationary as the scene scrolls past. The tunnel walls and ceiling constitute the background, while the road occupies the middle ground. The entire scene scrolls horizontally from left to right. In the foreground, user interface elements are fixed at the top left, top center, and top right corners of the screen.",
