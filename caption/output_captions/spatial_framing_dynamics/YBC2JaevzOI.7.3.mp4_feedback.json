    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a person is initially squatting in the center of the frame and the middle ground. They hold a light source in their right hand and a shoe in their left, both also positioned centrally. The person then places the shoe down, moving it to a lower central position, before standing up. This action causes the person to transition from a low central position to a taller one, while remaining in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The surrounding environment is completely dark, obscuring any other spatial elements. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a nearly pitch-black setting, a slender, pale-skinned young man is faintly visible. He is wearing a baseball cap and a long-sleeved hooded shirt, holding a small light source, resembling a mobile phone flashlight, in his right hand. Initially squatting and examining a canvas shoe in his left hand, he suddenly puts the shoe down and stands up. Due to the extreme darkness, specific details such as facial features and the exact style of clothing are indiscernible, with much of his body obscured by deep shadows.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a nearly pitch-black setting, a boy crouches, holding a small light source, akin to a cell phone flashlight, in his right hand. This light casts a steady, warm white glow, illuminating part of his hand, forearm, and the canvas shoe he holds in his left hand, while the rest of his body remains mostly in shadow. In the lower right corner, a withered plant branch is faintly visible. The boy is dressed in a dark green long-sleeved shirt and likely trousers, though the color of the trousers is indistinguishable. He quickly stands, revealing his upper body, with the light illuminating his face, fingers, and chest area. He wears a dark hat, and while facial details are blurry, the basic outline is discernible. A blurry oval reflection, possibly a lens flare, appears on the right side of the image. The rest of the environment remains dark.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
