    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a large, crowded concert hall with tiered seating, two men move quickly through the audience. The first man, dressed in all-black tactical gear, including a helmet and a large backpack, is leading the way. The second man, in pursuit and running behind, wears a dark suit and moves swiftly over the seats while staying low. As he moves, a small cloud of white smoke or dust erupts near him. The audience, composed of numerous light-skinned men and women in casual and formal attire, remains seated in the brown theater chairs, largely facing the stage where a full orchestra is performing. The video employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the orchestra members visible in the background but out of focus. The musicians in the orchestra are dressed in black.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective looking down into a large, modern concert hall, a performance is underway. The auditorium is filled with a large audience seated in curved, tiered rows of brownish-red chairs. On the stage below, an orchestra is visible. Two figures in dark clothing, one with a backpack, are moving toward the left side of the auditorium amidst the seated spectators. A small puff of white smoke briefly appears near one of the figures as they move through the crowd. The overall lighting is warm, with deep shadows cast across the seating areas.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a crowded theater where one person pursues another through the seats, captured in a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle wide shot, the camera looks down into a crowded concert hall. The audience, seated in curved, tiered rows, occupies the foreground and middle ground, filling the bottom, left, and central areas of the frame. In the center of the frame, two men move from right to left across the middle ground. The first man, in tactical gear, is positioned slightly ahead and to the left of the second man in a suit, who pursues him over the seats. A small puff of smoke briefly appears in the center of the frame, near the second man. The orchestra is situated in the upper right background on a stage below the audience. The curved architecture of the seating guides the viewer's eye across the scene, highlighting the central figures' movement through the stationary crowd.",
