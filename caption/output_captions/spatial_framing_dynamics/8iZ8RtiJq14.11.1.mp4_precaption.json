    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins focused on a closed, dark brown wooden door with a small, vertical glass pane. The door opens to reveal four stylized, featureless human figures, resembling mannequins, standing on a porch. In the center, two figures dressed in identical red short-sleeved shirts, red baseball caps with a yellow \"M\" logo, and dark pants hold a large, oversized check. The check is made out to \"Michael Hoover\" for \"One Million Dollars.\" On the left side of the frame stands a figure in a black polo shirt and dark pants, holding a large camera. On the right side of the frame is a fourth figure with a slender build, dressed in a black long-sleeved top and black pants, holding a microphone that also bears a yellow \"M\" logo.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From inside a dimly lit hallway, a dark wooden door with a narrow vertical window opens to reveal a bright daytime scene on a house porch. The porch features white pillars and a railing, with a lawn and another house visible in the background. Positioned on the porch are four faceless mannequins. Two central figures, wearing red shirts and caps with a yellow \"M\" logo, hold a large ceremonial check. On the left side of the frame, a mannequin in a black shirt holds a camera, and on the right side of the frame, another in a black outfit holds a microphone also bearing the yellow \"M\" logo. The oversized check is dated August 3, 2001, and is made out to Michael Hoover for \"One Million Dollars.\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera first captures a door. As the door opens, four people stand outside holding something like a banner. This is a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot, centrally framing a dark wooden door in the middle ground, as seen from a foreground hallway whose walls are visible on the left and right sides of the frame. The door opens inward to the left, transitioning to a full shot of four figures on a porch in the middle ground. Two figures occupy the center of the frame, holding a large check between them. A figure with a camera stands on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, while another figure holding a microphone is positioned on the right, also in the middle ground. The porch railing is in the middle ground, with a lawn and another house visible in the background. The camera remains stationary at the subjects' level, with the foreground door frame remaining on the left and right edges of the shot.",
