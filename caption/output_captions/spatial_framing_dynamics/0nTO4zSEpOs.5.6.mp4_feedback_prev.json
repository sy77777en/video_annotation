    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot with no main subject, filmed from an eye-level, first-person perspective. The video begins with a view through a large window into a bar, which occupies the middle ground of the entire frame. A patron is seated at the bar in the left-center, with a TV above her in the top-left. The camera then pans to the right, moving the view of the bar to the left and eventually out of the frame. This movement reveals a modern hallway that fills the scene. As the pan concludes, a large pillar stands in the right middle ground, partially framing an escalator in the right background. A dark, polygonal structure with low accent lighting occupies the center and left background, while a smooth concrete floor extends across the bottom of the frame. The \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\" overlay remains fixed in the bottom-left foreground throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an interior scenery shot of a modern commercial building at night. The video begins with a view through a large window into a stylish, dimly lit bar with exposed brick and numerous beer taps, where a lone patron in a pink sweater watches a baseball game on a TV. The camera then pans to reveal a sleek, minimalist hallway with smooth concrete floors, subdued accent lighting, and an escalator glowing with blue light in the background. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the atmosphere and architectural design of the contemporary indoor environment rather than any specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, begins by looking through a large glass window into a dimly lit, modern bar at night. The bar features a long wooden counter with numerous silver beer taps, backed by a concrete wall and a chalkboard menu. A woman sits on a high-top stool watching a baseball game on a television, while pendant lights hang from the ceiling. The perspective then pans right, passing the bar's entrance to reveal a spacious, modern hallway with a smooth concrete floor, dark polygonal walls, and recessed lighting along the base of the structure. The path continues towards an escalator descending to a lower level. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
