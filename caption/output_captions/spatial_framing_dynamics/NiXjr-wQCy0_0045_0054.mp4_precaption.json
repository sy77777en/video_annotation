    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows numerous small, irregularly shaped pieces of a translucent, bright blue, gel-like substance. A yellow and black tennis racket, with its oval head and white string grid, initially appears in the upper left portion of the scene and then moves to extend from the top to the lower center. The scattered blue pieces move toward the racket, passing through the strings and gradually merging. This culminates in the formation of a single, cohesive, roughly rectangular blob of the blue gel situated on the opposite side of the strings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting with green grass and a vertical wooden fence in the background, a yellow and black tennis racket appears in the upper left and moves to extend from the top to the lower center of the frame. A slow-motion sequence with speed ramping shows numerous small, translucent, blue gelatinous fragments converging from all directions toward the center. These pieces coalesce as they move toward the racket and pass the white strings, reforming into a single, wobbly, rectangular mass of the blue substance.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: At the beginning of the video, there is no visible subject. Then, water begins to converge along with a half-visible tennis racket. By the end, the water has formed a fully visible square-round shape being hit by the racket, suggesting that the video is played in reverse.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up showing small, blue, gel-like pieces scattered throughout the foreground and middle ground, set against a background of a wooden fence and middle-ground green grass. A yellow tennis racket, initially half-visible, enters from the top left and moves to position its head in the center of the frame. The scattered blue pieces then move upward and inward from various depths in the foreground, converging toward the center of the racket. They pass through the racket's strings, coalescing on the other side into a single, fully visible blue shape that rests in the center of the frame. The camera remains stationary and at the same height as the action throughout the video.",
