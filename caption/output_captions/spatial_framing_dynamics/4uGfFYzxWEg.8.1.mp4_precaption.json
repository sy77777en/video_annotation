    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main focus is on two posters displayed on a white wall. The poster on the left is a book cover for \"BAD SHOW\" by Bob Woffinden and James Plaskett, with the subtitle \"THE QUIZ, THE COUGH, THE MILLIONAIRE MAJOR.\" The cover is dark with white text and a bright, hazy light at the top. To its right is a poster for a 3-part limited event titled \"QUIZ.\" This poster features a man on the left with short dark hair, wearing a polo shirt and jeans. He leans forward with his hands clenched into fists and raised near his head, eyes closed, brow furrowed, and mouth wide open, revealing his teeth. His expression is excited and agitated, and his posture is full of tension. The man on the right, with short blond hair, is wearing a suit and sits upright with his head turned towards the man on the left, his mouth open. The text \"ARE YOU READY TO PLAY?\" is prominently displayed. To the far left of these posters, there are two other images: a newspaper clipping at the top featuring two photos\u2014one of a man in a suit with a blue tie and a woman in a dark coat, and another of the same woman in light-colored clothing with a red scarf. Their facial expressions are mostly calm or slightly serious. Below it, there is a photograph of a man in a dark suit and a woman in a pink scarf walking outdoors.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene features a light gray wall displaying several items. Positioned centrally is the dark cover of the book \"BAD SHOW: THE QUIZ, THE COUGH, THE MILLIONAIRE MAJOR\" by Bob Woffinden and James Plaskett. To its right is a poster for the AMC limited series \"QUIZ,\" which shows two men and the text \"ARE YOU READY TO PLAY?\". To the left, several photographs and a newspaper clipping are pinned to the wall, showing a man and women in various contexts, including a street scene. An overlay in the bottom left corner reads \"[14,16]\" in white font.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "A static full shot frames several items displayed on a wall. In the middle ground, a book cover for \"BAD SHOW\" occupies the center-left of the frame. Positioned to its right, also in the middle ground, is a poster for the series \"QUIZ.\" Further to the left, a newspaper clipping is located in the top-left and a photograph is in the bottom-left, both appearing in the middle ground against the background wall. The camera remains stationary at the subjects' level, providing a direct, straight-on view.",
