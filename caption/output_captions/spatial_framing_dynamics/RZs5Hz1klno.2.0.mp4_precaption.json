    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a faceless, metallic humanoid figure with a female form, seated at a desk in a dimly lit office. This figure has silver, reflective skin and matching hair styled in a bun. It is dressed in a black, long-sleeved, V-neck top. The figure is actively typing on a keyboard with both hands while sitting in a grey office chair. On the light-colored desk in front of it are a black computer monitor on a silver stand, a keyboard, a black mouse, a small black wallet, a larger black case, and a green pencil holder. In the background, an empty grey office chair is visible next to another chair occupied by an indistinct dark-grey figure, with one distant monitor displaying a mountain landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit, modern office. From a high-angle perspective, a figure with a reflective, metallic head and silver hair sits in a grey office chair, typing at a desk. The desk, which has a light-colored textured surface, is equipped with a black computer monitor on a silver stand, a keyboard, and a mouse. A small black case, a larger black portfolio, and a green pen holder also sit on the desk. The immediate area of the desks is illuminated, while the surrounding office space, including the space between the desks, is cast in deep shadow. In the background, there is an empty chair and a chair occupied by a dark-grey figure in front of another desk. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays the text \"Source: Drunk Hacking My Own Website (2019)\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle full shot, a metallic humanoid figure is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, seated at a desk. The desk occupies the lower half of the frame, extending from the center to the bottom right. In the middle ground, a computer monitor sits directly in front of the figure. A small wallet and a larger case are in the foreground at the bottom center and bottom right, respectively. The background, located in the top left and top center, contains other desks and chairs, with one indistinct figure and a monitor displaying a landscape visible in the top left. The camera remains static throughout the shot.",
