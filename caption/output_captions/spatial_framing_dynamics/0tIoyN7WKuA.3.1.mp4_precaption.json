    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a lean, athletic build is depicted wearing a form-fitting, dark red or maroon full-body suit. The suit features a cowl that covers both the top of his head and the upper half of his face, with small, wing-like protrusions on the sides. The figure appears translucent and ethereal, as if made of energy, with wisps of blue and white light swirling around and through his body, causing his form to shimmer and distort. He stands with his arms slightly extended to his sides.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark and turbulent outdoor setting at night, a vast, rocky ground stretches towards the horizon. The sky above is filled with swirling, dark, smoke-like formations and bright, electrical energy that flashes intermittently. The entire scene is presented with a blurry, distorted effect, featuring floating particles and light refractions. A translucent humanoid figure, wearing a red bodysuit, stands in the middle of this chaotic environment, consistently surrounded by blue energy currents.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a translucent figure standing in the center of the frame and in the middle ground of a dark, turbulent landscape. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, moves forward, transitioning into a medium full shot that frames the figure from the head to just below the hips. Throughout this forward movement, the subject remains centrally positioned within the frame, with the rocky terrain occupying the foreground and middle ground, and a swirling, energetic sky in the background.",
