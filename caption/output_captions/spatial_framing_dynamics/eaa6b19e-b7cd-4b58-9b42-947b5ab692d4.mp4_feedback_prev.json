    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from directly above, captures seven women arranged on a dark floor. One woman occupies the center of the frame, while the other six form a loose circle around her, distributed across the top, bottom, left, and right portions of the scene. The entire group performs synchronized movements, collectively rotating counter-clockwise on the floor. As they pivot, the women in the outer circle and the central woman extend and retract their limbs, causing the formation to shift dynamically as they pass through stationary, colored spotlights on the floor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of seven women are lying on a dark floor in a circular formation, performing synchronized dance movements. They are all dressed in vibrant, multicolored athletic outfits consisting of crop tops, shorts, and sneakers, with all wearing black knee pads. The outfits feature bright color combinations such as yellow and pink, orange, blue and white, and turquoise and red. Additionally, there is a woman in blue shorts positioned at the center of the circular formation, also performing dance movements. The women are illuminated by distinct spotlights of green, orange, blue, and pink light, which cast colorful glows on their bodies and the floor around them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a top-down perspective, an indoor scene is captured on a dark, matte floor. The environment is illuminated by vibrant, circular spotlights in shades of green, orange, pink, and blue, casting colorful pools of light across the surface. A faint yellow line is visible along one edge of the floor. Seven people in brightly colored athletic wear are arranged in a loose circle, performing synchronized movements by kicking their legs and shifting their positions on the floor, creating a dynamic, kaleidoscopic pattern within the colored lights. At the center of the loose circle, a woman in blue shorts is performing dance movements.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
