    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A fair-skinned woman with short, curly blonde hair styled in a 1920s fashion is seen performing on a stage. She wears a sparkly, silver, sleeveless flapper-style dress or leotard. Throughout the clip, she strikes various dance poses, including crouching and sitting, while looking toward the viewer. She is positioned on top of large, red, three-dimensional letters with a neon-light effect that spell out the name \"ROXIE.\" The letter 'I' in the name is topped with a red heart shape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid black background, a large, red, neon-style sign spells out the name \"ROXIE.\" The stylized letters cast a red glow and a faint reflection on the dark floor below. The dot on the letter 'I' is shaped like a heart. A woman with short blonde hair, wearing a silver sequined outfit, moves and poses along the top of the large letters.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a low angle, showing a woman in the center of the frame, posing on top of a large, red \"ROXIE\" sign that occupies the middle ground across the bottom half of the screen. A reflection of the sign is visible in the foreground. The shot then transitions into a full shot, zooming in as the woman moves from the center to the right side of the frame. She settles into a sitting pose on the letter 'I', now positioned on the right side of the frame in the middle ground, with the camera remaining at a low angle looking up at her.",
