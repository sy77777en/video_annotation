    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man and a woman, dressed in 18th-century attire, are the central focus. The woman, on the left, has fair skin and dark hair pinned up beneath a wide-brimmed straw hat adorned with a pale purple ribbon. She wears a light-colored, low-cut dress with ruffled details and is seen in profile, looking up at the man. The man, standing to her right, has fair skin and dark hair tied back. He is dressed in a red military coat with a black collar and silver buttons, topped with a black tricorn hat. He holds the woman's hand and looks down at her. As the scene progresses, the view widens to reveal a second man and woman in the background on the right. This second couple is dressed similarly: the man is in a red military uniform and the woman is in a light-colored dress and hat, and they stand together in a similar pose to the main couple.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in a vast, pastoral landscape during the day. A slow camera pullback begins on a couple in a green meadow, gradually revealing the expansive surroundings. The setting features rolling green hills, dense clusters of trees, and a wide body of water in the distance under a partly cloudy sky. As the view widens, many trees with gnarled branches becomes prominent on the left. A second couple dressed in similar period attire appears further back in the meadow, which is situated on a gentle slope. The continuous zoom-out transforms the composition from an intimate shot to a wide scenic vista.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The picture first focuses on a man and a woman in a medium close-up shot. As the camera zooms out, another man and a woman appear in the shot, and finally becomes an extreme wide/long shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a medium close-up of a woman on the left and a man on the right, both positioned in the foreground. The camera then executes a slow, continuous zoom-out, which transitions the frame from a medium close-up to a medium shot, and finally to an extreme long shot. As the camera pulls back, a second couple appears in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. The expanding view also reveals the surrounding landscape: a large tree becomes prominent in the left foreground, while the background is filled with rolling green hills and a distant body of water. In the final composition, the primary couple is positioned in the center-left foreground, with the vast landscape dominating the background. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
