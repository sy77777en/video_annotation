    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with an underwater view of a seabed covered in multicolored rocks and pebbles in shades of green, gray, and brown. The perspective then rises to break the surface of the clear water, revealing a rocky beach with several people. A young boy with light skin, wearing a black cap and blue swim trunks, sits at the water's edge. To the left, a young girl with light skin stands on the rocks, wearing a two-piece swimsuit with purple patterned bottoms. Further to the left, another young girl with brown skin and dark hair stands in a white one-piece swimsuit. Near them, a man with a darker complexion sits wearing a white shirt. In the midground, other beachgoers are visible, including a man in blue shorts walking near the water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins with an underwater view of a rocky seabed in clear, shallow water. The camera then rises to the surface, revealing a tropical shoreline during the daytime under an overcast sky. The beach is covered in pebbles and rocks, where several people are present near the water's edge. Lush green trees line the shore, and in the midground, thatched-roof huts are visible. A large, forested mountain rises behind the beach. The water gently ripples, creating a split view between the underwater rocks and the scene on land.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a wide shot of underwater rocks, and then moves upwards to the surface, capturing the people and scenery on the shore in a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the people appear, the camera is at the same height as them.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot where underwater rocks and pebbles fill the entire frame, extending from the immediate foreground into the middle ground. The camera then moves vertically upwards, breaking the surface to create a split-level view that places the underwater rocks in the foreground at the bottom of the frame and the shoreline in the middle ground above. As the camera settles at water level, the scene is framed as a wide shot of the beach. A young boy sits in the center-left middle ground at the water's edge. To his left, two young girls and a seated man are positioned along the rocky shore, also in the middle ground. In the background, lush trees line the shore from the left to the center, with a large, forested mountain rising behind them and extending to the right. Other beachgoers and thatched-roof huts are visible in the middle ground from the center to the right side of the frame. The camera remains at the same height as the people on the shore.",
