    "pre_caption": "In a wide, static shot, the scene is layered with depth. A blurred, dark fence occupies the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a passenger jet with its landing lights on is positioned on a runway in the right-center of the frame. To its left, a larger, parked airplane sits on the tarmac. A red and white lattice tower stands in the center-right, with a small, striped building at its base, positioned between the camera and the active runway. The background consists of a line of dark trees stretching horizontally across the scene, with hazy hills visible beyond them under a dusky sky. The camera is positioned at the level of the airplanes, maintaining a steady view across the airfield.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a wide shot of an airport at dusk, a white, twin-engine passenger jet with its bright landing lights illuminated is on a runway in the midground. To the left, also in the midground, a larger, white, four-engine passenger jet is parked. A red and white lattice tower and a small, red and white striped building stand near the runway.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At an airport during twilight, the scene is cast in a cool, teal-toned light. In the background, hazy hills rise above a line of dark trees. A large, white wide-body airplane is parked on the tarmac to the left. On a runway in the mid-ground, a smaller passenger jet is positioned with its bright landing lights shining. A red and white lattice communication tower and a small, red-and-white-striped building stand near the runway. The foreground is defined by the blurred, dark silhouette of a fence.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: A wide shot of an airport runway shows the camera keeping the approaching airplane in the right center of the frame as it moves. The plane occupies only a small portion of the frame, allowing the surrounding airport scenery to take up most of the shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
