    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An aerial, grainy video captures a police chase on a multi-lane highway. The main subject is a white, boxy SUV, a Ford Bronco, seen driving in the middle lanes. Following closely behind the white SUV are at least four black-and-white police cars. Other civilian vehicles, appearing as dark, indistinct shapes, are present in the opposite direction lanes. Yellow text at the bottom of the screen displays a police radio transmission: \"Regional 7, 10-4, Cobb could not see in the window of the vehicle,\" which later disappears.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, aerial perspective, the scene captures a multi-lane highway during the day. Long shadows cast by the vehicles suggest either early morning or late afternoon light. The highway, made of gray asphalt, cuts through a landscape with green trees and the tops of residential buildings visible at the bottom of the view. Several vehicles are in motion on the road, including a prominent white SUV, several black-and-white police cars, and other civilian cars. The video has a grainy, low-resolution quality with a distinct grid-like pattern. An overlay of yellow text at the bottom of the screen initially displays the caption: \"Regional 7, 10-4, Cobb could not see in the window of the vehicle,\" but this text eventually disappears during the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot from a high angle, showing a white SUV in the middle ground, slightly right of center, on a multi-lane highway. Several police cars are positioned to its left, also in the middle ground. In the foreground, the tops of trees are visible at the bottom of the frame. Yellow text is overlaid at the bottom of the screen. The camera then zooms in to a wide shot, centering on the white SUV as it moves across the highway. During this transition, the police cars move out of the frame, and the text overlay disappears. The shot concludes with the white SUV occupying the center of the frame in the middle ground, with the foreground trees remaining at the bottom.",
