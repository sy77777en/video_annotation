    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an urban scenery shot featuring a large-scale architectural structure. The video lacks a specific main subject, as the focus is on the imposing geometry and atmosphere of the environment. The camera begins with a low-angle view looking up at a pale, overcast sky framed by the converging lines of two parallel, elevated concrete tracks. As the view tilts down, it reveals the full structure: a monorail or elevated railway supported by a series of thick, weathered concrete pillars. The stark, grey tracks recede into the distance, creating a strong sense of perspective and scale, while below, a patch of green with tall grass and trees contrasts with the brutalist architecture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins with a low-angle view looking up at an overcast sky framed by two large, dark concrete beams. As the camera tilts downward, it reveals that these are parallel, elevated tracks supported by a series of thick, cylindrical concrete pillars that recede into the distance. The ground beneath the structure is covered with green grass and vegetation, flanked by trees on either side. In the background, apartment buildings are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot focused on an architectural structure. The video opens with a low-angle view looking directly up, where the overcast sky is framed in the center by two large concrete beams that occupy the left and right sides of the frame, converging toward the top. The camera then tilts downward, revealing the full scene from a low-angle perspective at ground level. In the final composition, the parallel elevated tracks and their supporting pillars recede from the middle ground toward the center background. Green grass and vegetation occupy the foreground at the bottom of the frame. Trees are positioned in the middle ground on the far left and right, while apartment buildings are visible in the distant background.",
