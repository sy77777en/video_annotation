    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, ape-like Titan stands as the central figure, leading a group of other Titans positioned within a thick mist over a grassy field. This main subject is a massive, muscular humanoid covered in dark brown fur, with a bare, well-defined chest and abdomen. It has long, powerful arms, a slightly hunched posture, and a humanoid face with a beard and glowing red eyes. Surrounding it are numerous other Titans of varying sizes and builds. These secondary figures are all naked, with disproportionate bodies; some are tall and thin, while others are short and stout. One notable Titan on the left is on all fours, carrying a large crate on its back. Only the Titans facing mostly forward have glowing red eyes, and they are all standing still or facing the camera as a unified force.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a grassy clearing during the day, a group of large, humanoid figures stands still, facing the camera within a thick white mist that blankets the ground and floats into the air. In the background, mountains are visible under a sunny sky with clouds, and a small cluster of pine trees stands on the right. The central figure is exceptionally large and covered in dark fur, while the surrounding figures are unclothed and have varying builds. Only the figures facing mostly forward possess glowing red eyes. One figure on the left is positioned on all fours, carrying a crate on its back, though the material is unclear.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a full shot where a large, ape-like Titan stands in the center of the frame and the middle ground, leading a group of other Titans. To its left in the middle ground are a short, stout Titan and another on all fours carrying a crate in the bottom-left corner. To its right in the middle ground stands a tall, thin Titan, with more figures scattered behind them in the middle ground and background. A thick mist blankets the foreground and lower middle ground, while a cluster of pine trees is visible on the right side of the middle ground, and mountains line the background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level and performs a slow, subtle push-in, causing the group to gradually enlarge within the frame.",
