    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured at the subject's level, a person is initially positioned in the middle ground, lying on a bed that occupies the lower half of the frame, extending from the center-left to the center-right. A pillow is in the left foreground. The person's red-haired head is in the center-left, with a small, glowing blue rectangle held near their eye. In the background, a bright window with a box fan on the sill is centered.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with red-dyed hair is shown in a dark, black-and-white room. Initially, the person is lying in bed, propped up on an elbow, with a digital effect in the shape of a rectangular eye mask emitting a bright blue glow covering their eyes. The individual, silhouetted against a window, then sits up in bed. They are wearing a light-colored short-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and dark shoes or boots, with other features obscured by the darkness.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, monochromatic bedroom. In the middle ground, a silhouetted person with red-dyed hair lies on a bed before sitting up. A glowing cyan rectangular overlay is visible near their eye. In the background, a bright window with blinds is partially covered by curtains, and a box fan sits on the windowsill, also in silhouette against the light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
