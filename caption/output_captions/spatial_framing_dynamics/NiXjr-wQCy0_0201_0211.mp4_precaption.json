    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The shot reveals an old, dark gray, boxy CRT television tilted backward. The television's screen is shattered, with broken glass pushed inward. Embedded in the center of the destroyed screen is a bowling ball. The bowling ball displays a swirled pattern of lime green and dark blue and features red lettering and logos. The brand name \"SHARP\" is visible in white on the front of the television's plastic frame, just below the broken screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place outdoors on a concrete surface, likely a driveway, in front of a red garage door with peeling paint and the corner of a brick building. A lime green and dark blue swirled bowling ball with red markings is shown with a speed ramp effect, having just crashed through the screen of an old, dark gray, boxy CRT television. The brand name \"SHARP\" is visible on the front of the television below the broken screen. The bowling ball comes to a rest inside the cavity of the television, surrounded by shattered glass. Small shards of glass and plastic debris are captured mid-air and scattered on the concrete ground.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the curved back of a television occupying the bottom foreground of the frame. The television then falls backward, revealing its front and transitioning the view into a full shot. As it falls, a bowling ball crashes through the screen, sending glass shards outward. The shot settles with the destroyed television tilted backward in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The bowling ball is embedded in the center of the shattered screen. In the background, a red garage door is on the left and a brick wall is on the right. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
