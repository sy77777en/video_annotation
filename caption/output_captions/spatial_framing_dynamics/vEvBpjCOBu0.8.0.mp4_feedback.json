    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot, filmed from a low angle level with the subjects, initially frames a clear glass suspended horizontally in the foreground and center of the frame. In the middle ground, the lower legs and feet of a person are positioned on the left and right sides, framing the glass. A dark object is visible in the background behind the person. The glass then falls vertically downwards through the center of the frame, tumbling as it descends. It comes to rest on the floor in the foreground, angled downwards and still positioned centrally between the person's static feet.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A clear, reflective drinking glass, shaped like a pint glass with a slight bulge near the middle, is shown falling and tumbling through the air. In the midground, the lower half of a person stands with their feet apart, wearing dark trousers and black slip-on shoes. The glass is positioned in the foreground, between the person's feet.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a level angle, an indoor scene is captured. A clear, reflective glass tumbler remains horizontal as it falls through the air and begins to tumble and point downward after hitting the smooth, light-colored floor. In the midground, the lower legs and feet of a person wearing dark pants and black shoes are visible, standing still. The background is dim, with a dark gray rectangular machine with small wheels visible. An overlay of white text reading \"[32]\" is present in the bottom left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
