    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A red car is seen from the rear, positioned in the middle of a road with patches of both light and dark areas, driving away from the viewer. The car's rear lights are faint and do not cast a red glow. Digital effects resembling panels and streaks emerge from the lighter areas of the road. The scene contains significant digital effects, particularly on both sides of the road and in the distant area beyond it. These effects primarily impact the light-colored areas of the surrounding green and yellow foliage-like structures and the light-colored areas on the road, stretching them into long, vertical, pixelated streaks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A red car with faint rear lights travels down a road that features patches of light and dark areas, creating a dynamic visual effect. The scene is characterized by prominent digital effects, with both sides of the road and the distant area beyond displaying pixelated, glowing greenish-white streaks. These streaks stretch vertically from the light-colored areas of the surrounding foliage-like structures and the road. Other parts of the scene are obscured by a dark mass, adding to the surreal atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, captured from the subject's level, where a red car is positioned in the center of the frame, driving away in the middle ground along a road. This road extends from the bottom of the frame toward the background. On the left and right sides of the frame, foliage-like structures with vertical digital effects occupy the middle ground and background. A large, blurry, dark mass is present in the foreground, primarily on the right side, partially obscuring the scene. As the car moves from the middle ground further into the background, the shot transitions to an extreme wide shot, causing the car to appear smaller as it recedes into the center distance.",
