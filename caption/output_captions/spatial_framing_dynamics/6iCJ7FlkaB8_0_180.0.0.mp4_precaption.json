    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a level camera angle, looking straight ahead at a weathered, light-brown stone statue of a robed and hooded figure, seen from the back with its arms raised high, holding two swords pointing upward. As the camera tilts downward, the angle shifts to a high angle, transitioning the focus to a group of young, fair-skinned people standing on a large green lawn. They are arranged in two long, parallel lines, facing one another, each dressed in a long, dark, uniform-like robe. On the grass in front of each individual lies a wooden broomstick.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an outdoor scene at a large stone castle during the daytime. The shot begins focused on a weathered stone statue of a figure holding two swords aloft. In the background, beyond a vast, manicured green lawn, stands the main castle structure with its towers, and a series of freestanding stone archways against a backdrop of rolling green hills. The camera then tilts down, revealing a group of people in dark robes standing in two parallel lines on the lawn. They are positioned on a wide, light-colored cobblestone path that curves across the grass.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot where a stone statue is positioned in the foreground on the left, its upper body and raised arms visible. A large green lawn occupies the middle ground, with a stone castle on the right and a series of stone archways in the background at the center. The camera then tilts downward, revealing a group of people arranged in two parallel lines in the middle ground, occupying the center and bottom of the frame. This movement transitions the scene to a wide shot of the group, who are standing on a cobblestone path that curves across the lawn, viewed from a high angle above them.",
