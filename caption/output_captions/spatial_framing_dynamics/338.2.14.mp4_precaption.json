    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light turquoise, retro-style record player is shown from a top-down perspective. On its spinning turntable rests a black vinyl record with an orange and red center label that has the word \"POLLYANNA\" printed on it. Several bottle caps of various colors and sizes, including silver, white, orange, and gold, are placed on the record, spinning along with it. A light-skinned hand, which appears to belong to an older person, enters the frame from the bottom right, reaches toward the turntable, and stops the record from spinning before retracting out of view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a top-down perspective, a turquoise record player rests on a light green tablecloth with a subtle floral pattern. A black vinyl record, featuring a red center label, spins on the turntable. Several small, cylindrical objects resembling bottle caps, with some appearing metallic and others in colors like orange and white, are placed on the surface of the moving record. A hand enters the scene from the bottom right, stops the spinning record player, and then withdraws from the scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: Initially, it's a full shot of a retro record player.  Then, a hand enters the frame from the bottom and exits the frame after stopping the player.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot is captured from a top-down perspective, with a turquoise record player centered in the frame against a light green tablecloth that serves as the background. In the middle ground, a black vinyl record with several bottle caps on its surface spins on the turntable. The player's tonearm is positioned on the left side of the record. A hand enters the frame from the bottom right, moving toward the center-right to stop the spinning record. After halting the motion, the hand retracts along the same path and exits the frame at the bottom right, while the shot size and camera position remain static.",
