    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A detailed, miniature-like model of a complex, linear structure is shown in a close-up, angled view. The model, which has a metallic, coppery color, is composed of long, rectangular sections. Some of these sections are framed and contain intricate, three-dimensional lattice-like structures, illuminated from within by a warm, yellow light. These illuminated sections are connected in a line, forming a central spine. The base of the model consists of a light gray panel featuring parallel raised silver metal strips. Positioned on either side of these strips are numerous smaller, dark, rectangular objects. The overall scene is rendered in cool, bluish tones, contrasting with the warm glow of the central structure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An intricate, miniature model is shown from a close, angled perspective. A long, rectangular section with a bronze-colored frame runs through the center, containing a complex, three-dimensional lattice structure. This central piece is situated on a base of light gray panels featuring dense, curved black and white textures. Several raised silver metal strips are arranged in parallel, with smaller dark block-shaped components spaced between them on either side. The scene is illuminated by warm, low-angle lights, casting long shadows and creating glowing highlights against a cool, gray background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static, close-up, high-angle shot, a detailed miniature model is displayed. The primary subject, a long, illuminated, lattice-like structure with a copper-colored frame, extends diagonally from the bottom left to the upper center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. On the light-colored base, numerous smaller, dark rectangular objects are positioned in the foreground at the bottom right and in the background toward the top left. The shallow depth of field keeps the central illuminated structure in sharp focus, while the elements in the immediate foreground and distant background are softly blurred.",
