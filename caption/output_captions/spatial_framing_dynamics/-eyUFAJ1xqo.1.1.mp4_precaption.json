    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short, dark, styled hair is shown in a dimly lit, purple-hued setting. He is wearing a dark suit jacket over a dark shirt. The man is initially seen bent forward with his hands resting on his knees. He then straightens his posture and turns his head to look toward the left, his face mostly obscured by shadow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a dimly lit outdoor space at night, bathed in a strong purple and magenta glow from an overhead light source. On a wall, three identical red posters are mounted in a single frame. Each poster displays the words \"SO LONG\" in white capital letters above a blue graphic depicting a cityscape. To the right of the posters is a short flight of stairs leading to a dark doorway. A person dressed in dark clothing, initially standing slightly to the right of the center of the frame, straightens up and stands silhouetted against the colored light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. In the background, a wall featuring three posters is located to the left, with a short flight of stairs on the right. As the man straightens his posture, the shot transitions into a medium close-up, reframing him from the chest up in the center of the frame and bringing him closer in the middle ground. He then turns his head toward the left, while the posters remain visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the scene.",
