    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot from a low-angle, forward-facing perspective, captured from a moving vehicle. The asphalt road occupies the bottom and center of the frame, extending from the immediate foreground into the background. A small, blurred portion of the vehicle's hood is visible at the bottom center in the foreground. Blurred buildings line the left and right sides of the frame in the middle ground. As the camera moves continuously forward, these buildings and other cars on the left streak past with significant motion blur. In the center background, distant cars remain stationary at a traffic light, and the camera steadily advances toward them throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, captured from the point-of-view of a vehicle driving down a multi-lane road at dusk. The scene is characterized by significant motion blur, conveying a sense of speed as the camera moves forward past indistinct buildings and other cars. In the distance, traffic lights glow against the fading light of the twilight sky. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the dynamic experience of moving through the urban environment, rather than on a specific object or entity. The rapid movement and wide perspective emphasize the overall scene and the feeling of travel.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures a drive down a multi-lane road at dusk. The sky is a pale, muted color above the urban landscape. The dark asphalt road features yellow and white lane markings, including a turn arrow. Buildings on either side of the street are indistinct due to motion blur. Other cars, with their red taillights illuminated, are visible on the road ahead, stopped at a traffic light that remains red throughout the scene. The entire scene is imbued with a sense of rapid forward movement, evident in the streaking blur of stationary objects.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
