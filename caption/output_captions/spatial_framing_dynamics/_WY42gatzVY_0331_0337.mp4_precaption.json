    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person's hand, clad in a blue and black glove, holds a large spiny lobster. The lobster has a reddish-brown, textured, and spiny carapace. The video shows the hand and lobster both underwater and then emerging from the water's surface. Out of the water, the lobster's dark, reddish-brown color and curled, segmented tail are visible, held by the person whose arm is covered in a blue sleeve.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a scene both underwater and at the surface of a clear, turquoise ocean during the daytime. Below the surface, the view looks down upon a rocky seabed with patches of dark vegetation and sand, where a school of small fish swims. The perspective ascends through the water, with bubbles rising, and emerges into the bright sunlight, revealing the vast ocean with gentle waves and a distant horizon. A gloved hand holds a large, reddish-brown spiny lobster with reddish-brown-tipped appendages.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a hand holding a lobster in the sea in a close-up shot. Then the object disappears from the camera, leaving only the seabed in a wide shot. Later, the object reappears and emerges from the water, showing in a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Initially, the camera is at the subject\u2019s height, then above, and ends at the subject\u2019s height again.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of a gloved hand holding a lobster, which occupies the foreground on the left side of the frame, with the camera at the subject's height. The rocky seabed and a school of fish are visible in the middle ground and background, extending across the right and center. The hand and lobster then move down and out of the frame, transitioning the view to a wide shot of the seabed, now seen from a higher camera position looking down. As the camera ascends, bubbles rise from the bottom of the frame, and the hand holding the lobster reappears in the foreground at the bottom. The camera emerges from the water, returning to a close-up shot with the hand and lobster now held in the center-left foreground, at the camera's height, against the backdrop of the ocean surface which fills the middle ground and background.",
