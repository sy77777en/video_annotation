    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot that slowly zooms out to reveal a detailed cross-section of a vast, multi-level building. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and intricate, symmetrical design of the structure, creating a formal and imposing atmosphere. The dimly lit interior shows numerous rooms across several floors, including various auditoriums with white or blue tiered seating, and a central, wood-paneled chamber containing an altar-like table. At the bottom level, a large hall features a mural and two simple benches. As the camera pulls back, the building's stark, fortress-like exterior is revealed, reinforcing the sense of a grand and sterile institution.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A cross-section view reveals the interior of a large, multi-level building rendered in a muted, monochromatic color palette. The surrounding space is dark, with focused artificial lighting illuminating various rooms. At the center is a two-story hall with a curved, wood-paneled back wall, a central table, and several chairs. On either side of this main hall, and on different floors, are smaller rooms containing rows of seating; some rooms have white chairs arranged in semi-circles, while another has rows of blue chairs. The lowest visible level is a wide, open area featuring a large mural on a curved back wall and two white benches placed in the center. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly zooms out, gradually revealing the building's massive, blocky, and tower-like exterior structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot focused on the architecture of a building. The video begins with a wide shot of a cross-section of a large, multi-level building, which fills the entire frame from a straight-on perspective. A central, wood-paneled chamber occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground, with smaller auditoriums positioned on the top left, top right, middle left, and middle right. A large hall with a mural is visible at the bottom center. The camera then slowly zooms out, transitioning into an extreme wide shot. This movement reveals the building's massive, blocky exterior, which frames the interior cross-section, now smaller and centered in the middle ground, while the outer structure occupies the surrounding foreground and background.",
