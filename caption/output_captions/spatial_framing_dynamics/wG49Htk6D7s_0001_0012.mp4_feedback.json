    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot that begins with a low-angle view looking up at a skyscraper in the background. A large, blue holographic advertisement is positioned in the center-left middle ground, with a smaller pink neon sign in the top-right middle ground. The camera then performs a continuous downward tilt, causing the initial advertisements to move up and out of the frame while following the building's facade. The shot concludes at a lower angle, revealing the base of the building in the middle ground, which occupies the center and left of the frame. Street-level neon signs enter the view in the middle ground on the right, with storefront signs appearing on the bottom left. A human silhouette enters the bottom right foreground, positioned below the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures the overwhelming scale and atmosphere of a futuristic, dystopian metropolis at night. It begins with a low-angle view looking up at a towering skyscraper, where a massive, blue holographic advertisement for \"SONY\" is projected onto its side, accompanied by a glowing pink neon sign that reads \"EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO SEE.\" As the camera slowly tilts downward, the pink sign changes to \"EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO HEAR.\" The descent reveals the immense, dark facade of the building, with the \"SONY\" advertisement appearing again to the left of the centered building, slightly lower, followed by a large area of pink spotlight projected onto the right side. Rows of dimly lit windows are set against a hazy, polluted-looking sky. Further down, smaller, colorful neon signs for street-level businesses, including a green symbol and a yellow sign for a noodle shop, pierce through the gloom. By the end of the video, a black silhouette of a male figure, with his back to the camera, enters from the lower right corner. The shot's purpose is to establish the environment and mood, focusing on the vast, technologically saturated, and impersonal scale of the city rather than any specific character or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at night in a hazy, futuristic urban environment, looking up at the dark facades of towering skyscrapers. A massive, horizontal blue \"SONY\" advertisement is projected onto the side of a building by a spotlight. Nearby, a smaller, purple holographic banner displays an image and neon text that changes from \"EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO SEE\" to \"EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO HEAR.\" A few windows in the central building emit scattered lights. The camera tilts downward, revealing the lower levels of the buildings and the street below, which is covered in a layer of snow. Various smaller neon signs are visible, including a green one, an orange one depicting steaming bowls, and a white sign featuring a circular symbol. Streetlights and parked cars are visible on the left, while a dark human silhouette enters from the lower right, also at street level.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
