    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From an extreme high-angle perspective at night, a dark car, identifiable by its two bright headlights and a single red taillight, travels from right to left across an industrial area. A large, thick cloud of white dust or smoke billows into the foreground, completely enveloping the scene and hiding the car from sight. As the smoke thins out, the car is revealed again, having continued on its path, now visible further in the distance within a wider shot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, an industrial complex is partially obscured by a massive, billowing plume of thick, white smoke or steam that dominates the foreground and left side of the view. In the background, the dark silhouettes of industrial structures, scaffolding, and a large cylindrical tank are visible. The dark scene is sparsely illuminated by a few artificial lights on the buildings and a pair of lights, possibly from a vehicle, on the ground level.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera tracks a car in an extreme high-angle shot, moving left. As the car drives, dust obscures the foreground, and the car disappears from the frame. The car keeps moving in the same direction until the dust clears, revealing the car again in an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "From an extreme high-angle perspective, a car is initially positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, with industrial structures visible in the background. A large cloud of smoke occupies the left foreground. As the car travels from right to left across the middle ground, the smoke in the foreground billows and expands to the right, eventually covering the entire frame and obscuring the car and the background. When the smoke clears, the view transitions to an extreme wide shot, revealing the car has continued its leftward movement and is now positioned further in the distance on the left side of the frame.",
