    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned young adult man with short, blondish-brown hair is shown in mid-air, wearing a black short-sleeved t-shirt, black pants, and a black skydiving harness. He is holding a camera to film himself, and his facial expression dynamically changes from a wide smile to an open-mouthed shout before closing his mouth. Initially, a large hot air balloon with a vibrant, multi-colored rainbow pattern arranged in a spiral is visible behind him, but as the video progresses, it disappears from view, revealing a brownish landscape as the perspective shifts. White text overlay in the top left corner reads \"SHOT ON OSMO ACTION 4\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a selfie POV shot where the camera is held by the person being filmed, a man wearing a black shirt and a harness is seen falling through a clear, light blue sky during the daytime. In the midground, a large hot air balloon with a vibrant, spiraling pattern of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, white, and brown is visible. As the scene progresses, the man and the balloon move relative to each other against the open sky. The balloon eventually moves out of the frame, primarily due to the camera movements, revealing a vast brownish landscape beneath the man. An overlay of white text in the top-left corner reads \"SHOT ON OSMO ACTION 4\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a man in the center foreground, captured from a low-angle perspective with the camera held below him. In the top-right middle ground, a multi-colored hot air balloon is visible against a sky background. As the man falls and brings his knees toward his chest, the framing tightens to a medium shot. Concurrently, the hot air balloon moves toward the top of the frame and exits, while a brownish landscape enters the frame at the bottom, occupying the background. The camera's position shifts from being below the man to being above him, resulting in a high-angle perspective by the end of the clip.",
