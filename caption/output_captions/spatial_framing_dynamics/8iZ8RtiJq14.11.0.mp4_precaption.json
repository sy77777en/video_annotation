    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a computer-generated, high-angle scenery shot of a suburban home. The focus is on establishing the environment rather than highlighting a specific subject, with the camera moving in a counterclockwise arc to capture the entire property and its immediate context. The two-story house features a light-colored exterior, a roof with a combination of gray and white tiles and a satellite dish, and an attached garage with a basketball hoop. A covered porch extends across the front, and the property is enclosed by a wooden fence on a neat green lawn. Details like a basketball on the driveway, a small slide in the backyard, and a portion of a neighboring house contribute to the typical suburban atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, a two-story suburban house with light-colored siding and a grey shingled roof is situated on a plot of green grass. An attached one-car garage features a basketball hoop mounted above the door, and a single basketball rests on the concrete driveway. A covered porch extends across the front of the residence, lined with small shrubs. The backyard is enclosed by a wooden fence, where a small children's slide is visible. A satellite dish is affixed to the roof of the main structure, and a portion of a neighboring house is visible in the midground.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, high-angle scenery shot focused on a suburban home. The house is centrally located in the frame, occupying the middle ground. In the foreground at the bottom of the frame, a driveway is visible, while the surrounding yard and wooden fence extend from the foreground to the background. A portion of a neighboring house is situated in the background on the top right. The camera, positioned high above the scene, executes a slow, counterclockwise arc, gradually shifting the perspective from a view of the side and back of the house to a more frontal angle.",
