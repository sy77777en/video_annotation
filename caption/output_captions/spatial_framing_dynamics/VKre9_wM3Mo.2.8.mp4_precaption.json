    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A frosted, glass-like figure of a person is bent over a toilet of the same material. The person is positioned in front of the toilet, leaning forward and looking down into the bowl. The toilet is a standard design with a tank and bowl, and a bright blue light glows from within the bowl, illuminating the base of the toilet and the lower leg of the person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, abstract setting with a black background, an opaque, glass-like figure of a person is shown bent over a matching opaque toilet. The scene is illuminated by a soft light source from outside the frame, creating a pool of light on the dark gray surface at the lower center of the frame. A blue glow emanates from within the toilet bowl. White subtitles appear as an overlay at the bottom-left of the screen, displaying \"[7]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot captured from a high angle, a translucent figure of a person and a toilet are positioned in the center of the frame. They occupy the middle ground, isolated within a dark, abstract space. A pool of light on the dark gray floor surrounds them, with the empty foreground leading to their central placement and the background fading into complete blackness. The figure stands directly in front of the toilet, bent over it. The entire scene remains static.",
