    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **At eye level, a person with blurry golden hair is partially visible, positioned slightly to the right of the center of the frame. They are wearing a dark blue long-sleeved shirt, dark shorts, and a black athletic shoe. The person uses their hand to set a light blue squash racket with a black grip spinning on its tip on a wooden floor. After giving it a twist, the person's hand moves away, and the racket continues to spin on its own before falling over. The person's lower leg and foot remain visible at the lower center of the frame, slightly to the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a top-down perspective, the scene is set on an indoor court with a light-colored wooden floor marked by a solid red line. A person, partially visible in dark athletic wear and black shoes, moves their hand away from a light blue racket with a black handle. The racket spins and clatters on the floorboards before coming to a rest.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person with golden hair making a blue tennis racket spin. The camera is facing the ground. On the right side of the frame, part of the person\u2019s body is visible. The focus is on the person\u2019s hand placing the racket on the ground and twisting it to make it spin. As the camera descends, the hand moves away from the racket, and it continues spinning before falling to the ground. At the end, only a small part of the racket is visible in the bottom-left corner of the frame, with part of the person\u2019s lower body appearing on the right side.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "From a static, high-angle perspective, the scene is initially framed on a person's hand in the center foreground, holding a squash racket upright on a wooden floor. A portion of the person's body occupies the right side of the frame, while a red line runs horizontally across the upper third of the scene. The hand moves up and out of the frame to the right, leaving the racket spinning in the center foreground. The racket then falls, moving from the center to the bottom-left quadrant, where it comes to rest on the floor. The final composition shows the stationary racket in the bottom-left foreground and the person's lower leg and foot in the bottom-right foreground.",
