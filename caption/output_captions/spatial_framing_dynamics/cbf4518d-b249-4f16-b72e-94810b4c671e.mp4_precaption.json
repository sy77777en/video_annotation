    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with fair skin, short dark brown hair, and stubble is seated in the center, wearing a blue and white checkered shirt. He initially looks down at a document on the table before looking up with a direct and serious expression, and then turns to his left. To the left, a partially visible man with brown skin, a beard, and short black hair is wearing a dark suit jacket. He initially looks down at another document on the desk in front of him before turning to his left. To the right, a partially visible woman with long brown hair is wearing a black top. All three are seated at a table.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting with a light gray, textured wall, three people are seated side-by-side at a long table. The central figure, a man wearing a blue and white patterned shirt, is positioned between a partially visible man in a dark suit and a woman in a black top. On the table before them are glasses of water, a blue folder, a brochure, and an orange object, though the woman's folder is not visible. The man in the center lifts his head from looking at the brochure to stare directly forward, and then turns to look to his left.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera begins by capturing part of the upper bodies of three people along with their reflections on the tabletop. It then tilts up, turning into a medium close-up shot of them.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The shot begins with a view of the upper bodies of three people seated side-by-side in the middle ground: a man in the center, a partially visible man on the left, and a partially visible woman on the right. A table with documents and glasses occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame, set against a wall in the background. The camera then tilts upward, reframing the scene into a medium close-up that captures the subjects from the shoulders up. As the camera moves, the central man, who was looking down at the foreground, lifts his head to look forward before turning to his left. The man on the left also turns his head to his left. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
