    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A metallic, circular object, identified as an astrolabe, is shown. It has a gold or brass-like appearance and features a small loop at the top for suspension. The front face is intricate, with a rotating pointer, or alidade, pivoted at the center. This face has complex cut-outs with scalloped, cloud-like edges, revealing a plate with grid-like markings underneath. The back of the astrolabe is simpler, featuring a different set of crossed arms. Throughout the sequence, the object is seen in both its metallic gold color and also bathed in a red light, giving it an uneven rust-red appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an objective shot, a golden, circular, and ornate astrolabe is suspended against a black background filled with small, out-of-focus white dots that resemble a swirling starfield. The astrolabe, which has a pointer and intricate markings, slowly rotates, at times catching a red light that illuminates its surface. A small white number \"2\" is overlaid at the bottom left corner of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Due to insufficient background information, it is difficult to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a metallic, circular astrolabe suspended in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground against a black background filled with small, out-of-focus white dots resembling a swirling starfield, which extends across the entire frame and remains in the background. The astrolabe is centrally positioned both horizontally and vertically, with its entire form visible and unobstructed. A small white number \"2\" is overlaid at the bottom left corner of the frame, remaining in the foreground. The astrolabe slowly rotates on its vertical axis, causing its front and back faces to become visible at different moments, and at times, a red light illuminates its surface, altering its appearance but not its spatial position. The camera maintains a consistent distance and framing throughout, with no significant changes in shot size or camera angle. The camera\u2019s height relative to the astrolabe cannot be determined from the available information.",
