    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot, where a sheet of paper occupies the foreground in the bottom half of the frame, with a person's torso positioned in the middle ground on the right. The camera then pulls back to a medium shot, revealing the person from behind in the center of the frame, running down a long hallway that extends into the background. In this final composition, a briefcase is visible on the right side of the frame, held by the person. Several sheets of paper are suspended in the air: one is in the foreground at the bottom left, and another is in the middle ground to the left of the person. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person, viewed from behind, appears to be running away from the camera, although they remain stationary throughout the video. They wear a tan, uniform-style jacket and matching trousers tucked into tall black boots. In their right hand, they carry a reddish-brown briefcase. Several white sheets of paper with black text printed on them appear to fall from their left hand and flutter through the air, but they are actually stationary and suspended in the air.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A person, seen from behind, is positioned in a long, narrow hallway with light-colored walls and closed doors, creating the illusion of running with a briefcase. Several sheets of paper are arranged to appear as if they are falling and floating through the air. The entire scene is illuminated by a dim, artificial light that casts a strong yellowish, sepia-like hue. An overlay is present at the bottom left, displaying \"[24]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
