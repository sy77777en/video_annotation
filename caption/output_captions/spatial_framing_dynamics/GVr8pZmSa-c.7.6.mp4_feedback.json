    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot frames a section of a circular, metallic mechanism, with a large, dark disc occupying the foreground on the left side of the frame. In the middle ground, concentric rings with raised letters and spheres curve from the bottom center toward the top right. Initially, the letter 'B' is visible in the bottom center, while the letter 'A' and adjacent metallic spheres are positioned in the center-right. The entire mechanism rotates slightly clockwise, shifting the letter 'A' toward the center, and then rotates counter-clockwise, bringing the letter 'B' more prominently into the bottom-center of the frame as the letter 'A' moves back toward the top right. The camera remains stationary and positioned at the subject's level throughout the movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up view shows a portion of a complex, circular, mechanical device made of dark, weathered metal with a bluish-gray tint and a scratched texture. The device consists of several concentric rings. The outer rings feature raised, blocky letters and symbols, including the Latin letters 'A' and 'B'. Uneven, polished, metallic spheres are set into the mechanism, with at least two positioned next to the letter 'A'. The central component is a large, dark, circular disc with a heavily scratched surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A close-up, objective shot focuses on a complex, circular mechanism made of dark, weathered metal. The device consists of multiple concentric rings that rotate together as a single unit, each inscribed with raised, blocky letters and symbols. The metallic surfaces are heavily scratched and worn, suggesting age or use. Unevenly polished metal spheres are positioned on the rings. The entire large circular mechanism rotates first clockwise and then counter-clockwise. The scene is dimly lit, with focused light creating stark highlights and deep shadows that accentuate the rough texture of the monochromatic, grey-toned device.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
