    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing the iconic waterfront of Venice, Italy, under a clear blue sky. The video shows the camera performing a counterclockwise arc across the ornate, Gothic facade of the Doge's Palace, with its intricate patterns and arched loggia, and also reveals the towering St. Mark's Campanile. The turquoise waters of the Venetian Lagoon are active with various boats, including a white motorboat speeding past. There is no main subject, as the camera's broad, sweeping movement is designed to showcase the magnificent scale and bustling atmosphere of the environment rather than any individual element. The focus is on the overall scene and the interplay between the historic architecture and the waterway.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A daytime view from the water in Venice, Italy, shows the iconic Doge's Palace under a clear blue sky. The ornate palace, an example of Venetian Gothic architecture, features a lower section with arches and a middle-lower colonnade of pointed arches, with an upper facade displaying a beige and white diamond pattern. To the left, the tall, brick St. Mark's Campanile is visible. The scene is set on the greenish-blue waters of a canal, where a white motorboat and other boats navigate the surface, while gondolas are docked along the crowded waterfront promenade.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot. Initially, the Doge's Palace is framed in the center-right middle ground, with the canal occupying the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The camera, positioned at a low angle from the water, executes a counterclockwise pan to the left. During this movement, the palace shifts to the right side of the frame, while St. Mark's Campanile enters from the left, also in the middle ground. Concurrently, a white motorboat moves from right to left across the foreground. The shot concludes with the Campanile on the left and the palace on the right, both situated in the middle ground beyond the foreground canal.",
