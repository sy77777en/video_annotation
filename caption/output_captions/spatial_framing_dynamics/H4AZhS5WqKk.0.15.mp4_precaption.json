    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two cartoon cats. The main subject is a large, gray-blue cat with a white muzzle, a black nose, long whiskers, and yellow eyes. Initially, this cat has a surprised expression. A smaller, red cartoon cat, styled like a devil with pointed ears and a tail, appears to the right, standing on a small white cloud and holding a red trident. After the red cat disappears, the gray-blue cat's expression changes to a wide, mischievous grin with narrowed eyes as it moves partially out of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a dark, ambiguous setting at night, characterized by a textured, dark-colored wall and soft, out-of-focus white lights in the background. Some of these lights intermittently flicker on and off, adding to the atmosphere. A small, red, devil-like cat holding a red trident materializes on a small, white, fluffy cloud. As this occurs, stylized red, liquid-like trails swirl through the air.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features two cartoon cats. It begins with a close-up of a gray-blue cartoon cat, followed by the appearance of a red cartoon cat on a cloud with a full body visible on the right side of the frame. The red cat then disappears, and the gray-blue cat moves to the right, likely to chase the red cat. In the final shot, only part of the gray-blue cat's body and an ear remain in the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a large, gray-blue cat occupying the left foreground. A smaller, red cat, visible in a full shot, materializes in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, standing on a white cloud and surrounded by swirling red trails. In the background, a dark wall is punctuated by out-of-focus white lights. The red cat, its cloud, and the red trails then disappear from the right side of the frame. Subsequently, the gray-blue cat moves from the left towards the right, partially exiting the frame until only the right side of its head and ear remain visible on the far left. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the sequence.",
