    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a tranquil cityscape scenery shot capturing a wide river at sunset. In the distance, the silhouette of a modern city skyline, including a prominent, large building under construction, is visible against a hazy, golden sky where a few birds are flying. The setting sun reflects brightly on the water's surface, where several small, traditional boats are scattered. In the immediate foreground, a small, rustic wooden hut with a simple roof stands on the grassy riverbank, silhouetted against the bright water. The video lacks a main subject, as the composition emphasizes the overall serene atmosphere and the juxtaposition of the natural, rural foreground with the distant urban landscape. The focus is on the environmental mood created by the golden light of sunset rather than any specific object or action.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene captures a wide expanse of water at sunset, with a city skyline silhouetted in the hazy, golden distance. The low sun creates a bright, shimmering reflection across the water's surface. Several small, dark boats are visible on the river. In the foreground, from a grassy riverbank with some simple fencing, a small, simple hut is silhouetted against the bright background. Birds can be seen flying in the pale yellow sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a scenery with no main subject. The composition is layered in depth. In the foreground, a grassy riverbank with a small, silhouetted hut occupies the bottom third of the frame, with the hut positioned in the bottom center. The middle ground is dominated by a wide river, where the sun's bright reflection is located in the center. Several small boats are scattered across the middle ground on the water, to the left and right of the reflection. In the background, a city skyline stretches horizontally across the frame, silhouetted against the hazy sky which fills the top third. A few birds are visible in the top left and top center of the sky. The camera is positioned at a low height, level with the foreground riverbank, and the shot remains static throughout.",
