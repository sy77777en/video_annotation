    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a rural landscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet road that stretches through a small village area. The scene features a broad, sunlit sky filled with scattered, fluffy clouds, and the road is flanked by green fields, trees, and a few houses with red and blue roofs. A prominent red archway with colorful flags and Vietnamese text spans the road, adding a cultural touch to the otherwise tranquil environment. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the sense of openness and calm provided by the natural and built environment, rather than on any specific object or individual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors on a sunny day, showing a rural road leading toward a village entrance marked by a large red archway with yellow text and several small flags on top. The road before the arch is initially bordered by metal railings and later by red and white short posts, and the scene is flanked by green fields and scattered trees. A few houses featuring red-tiled roofs and white walls are visible beyond the arch. The sky is mostly clear with scattered, fluffy clouds. The scene transitions as the camera moves forward, getting close to the arch and reaching the village. The environment is calm, with no visible vehicles or pedestrians, and the overall setting is defined by open space, rural architecture, and natural elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture a rural landscape with no main subject, focusing on the overall scenery. In the initial frame, the road runs from the bottom center foreground toward the center background, flanked by metal railings on both sides in the foreground and green fields and trees in the middle ground to the left and right. A large red archway with flags spans the road in the middle ground, positioned centrally in the frame, with houses visible beyond it in the background, mostly to the right and center. The sky fills the upper half of the frame, occupying the background and top center. As the camera moves forward at road level, the archway transitions from the middle ground to the foreground and then overhead, while the houses and village elements shift from the background to the middle ground and foreground, becoming more prominent. The camera maintains a height at or slightly above the road, providing a level perspective throughout the movement.",
