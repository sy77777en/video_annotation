    "pre_caption": "The scene is captured in a static full shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. Initially, the main subject, a man in a dark suit, is on the left side of the frame in the middle ground, moving toward the right to engage with opponents in the center and right middle ground. As the action unfolds, the main subject moves to the center, kicking an opponent who falls into the bottom left foreground. He remains in the center middle ground as more opponents enter from the right, and he strikes down two more attackers, who fall consecutively to the bottom center and bottom left foreground. The main subject's movement is primarily horizontal across the center of the frame, while his defeated opponents accumulate on the ground in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit, green-tinted room, a man in a dark suit is the main subject, engaged in a chaotic fight against a group of several other men. The opponents include a shirtless man with tattoos exclusively on his back, a man in a dark hooded jacket, and others in dark, casual clothing, some of whom are holding sticks. The main subject, wielding a hammer, is in the midst of a violent brawl, shown kicking and striking his attackers as they swarm him from multiple directions. Three of the attackers are seen falling to the ground consecutively during the fight.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This scene takes place in a dim, narrow indoor corridor with a pervasive green tint. The walls appear to be made of dirty, green-painted panels, and the low ceiling is a dense tangle of black pipes and electrical conduits with exposed wiring. A white electrical box is mounted on the right wall. The space is sparsely lit from an overhead source, casting harsh shadows and often reducing the moving figures to silhouettes. In the background, several doors line the wall, with a pipe running next to them. A red circular light is installed at the bottom of the right wall. The scene is filled with rapid, blurred motion as several people move violently through the confined area.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
