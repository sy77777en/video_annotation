    "pre_caption": "This scenery video presents a static wide shot of the upper portion of a stone tower, captured from a low-angle perspective. The tower is positioned in the center of the frame, extending from the bottom edge upwards, and occupies the foreground. In the background, a blue sky with white clouds fills the rest of the frame, surrounding the top of the tower. There is no camera movement, and the tower remains stationary throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is an architectural scenery shot, featuring a low-angle perspective looking up at a massive, cylindrical stone tower. The structure is composed of multiple stacked tiers, each encircled by an open gallery of slender columns and rounded arches, creating a repeating, intricate pattern against a vibrant blue sky filled with drifting white clouds. The focus is not on a specific subject performing an action, but rather on the overall atmosphere, emphasizing the monumental scale and grandeur of the architecture in relation to the vast, dynamic sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A low-angle, outdoor shot captures the upper portion of the Leaning Tower of Pisa during the daytime. The cylindrical, multi-tiered tower is made of light-colored stone and features rows of colonnades with rounded arches. The structure is set against a bright blue sky filled with scattered, puffy white clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
