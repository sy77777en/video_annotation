    "pre_caption": "In this medium shot, a silhouetted man occupies the center foreground, his back to the camera as he stands just outside a glass door. Through the glass, a second man is visible in the middle ground, positioned in the left-center of the frame, actively playing squash within a brightly lit court that extends into the background. The glass door acts as a framing device, separating the dark foreground from the illuminated middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level and remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short, light-colored hair, seen from behind, stands in the foreground wearing a black sleeveless shirt. He is silhouetted as he raises his hands toward his ears. Through a glass door in front of him, another man with dark hair is visible inside a squash court. This second man, wearing a grey t-shirt and dark shorts, is actively playing squash, holding a racquet with a green frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in an indoor squash court, viewed from just outside through a glass door. A person in a dark silhouette stands in the foreground, looking into the brightly lit court where another person is actively playing. The court features white walls, a light-colored wood floor, and a red horizontal line running across the walls. The player inside, wearing a grey shirt and shorts, swings a racquet with a green frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
