    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This animated video shows a white, two-engine commercial airplane positioned on a runway at an airport. The plane is angled toward the right, situated at an intersection where a gray-purple curved taxiway meets a gray-brown main runway, which is marked with white stripes. The runway and taxiways are bordered by brown, grassy terrain. The entire scene is presented with a monochromatic, reddish-brown color filter.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A high-angle view captures an airport scene under a hazy, reddish-brown sky. A white passenger airplane is first seen on a gray-purple taxiway with yellow markings before moving onto the gray-brown main runway with white markings. The runway is part of an intricate network of taxiways interspersed with patches of brown grass. In the background, silhouettes of some buildings are barely visible through the thick haze. The entire scene has a monochromatic, sepia-toned appearance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot from a high-angle perspective, capturing a white airplane in the center-left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a taxiway. An intricate network of runways and taxiways fills the foreground and middle ground, while a hazy city skyline is visible in the distant background across the top of the frame. As the camera slowly zooms in, the shot transitions to a wide shot. During this zoom, the airplane moves from the taxiway onto the main runway, repositioning itself slightly to the right but remaining in the center of the frame as it aligns for takeoff.",
