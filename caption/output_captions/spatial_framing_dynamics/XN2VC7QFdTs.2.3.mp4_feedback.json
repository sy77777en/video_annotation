    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a man in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a rooftop, with a large building in the background. He walks from the center toward the left side of the frame. As he drops into a kneeling position behind a low, reddish-brown wall in the middle ground, the framing changes to a medium shot. He settles in the left-center of the frame, still in the middle ground, and aims a rifle over the wall toward the right. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with short, blond hair is shown on a rooftop. He is wearing a dark gray suit, a white collared shirt, and black dress shoes. He walks across the rooftop, holding a black, short-barreled assault rifle with a suppressor. He drops into a kneeling position behind a low, reddish-brown wall, holding the rifle in a ready stance before aiming it over the wall.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds on a flat, reddish-brown rooftop during the day, under a warm, yellow-toned light. The roof is bordered by a low parapet wall of the same color, featuring some decorative shapes with a curved, scalloped top on its edge. In the background, a multi-story, yellowish-beige concrete building rises, its facade marked by a grid of dark-framed windows, some with visible curtains. Wires and a satellite dish are affixed to the building's exterior. A man in a dark gray suit moves across the rooftop, eventually kneeling behind the parapet wall with a black rifle. Smoke or dust emanates from below, between the rooftop and the building.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
