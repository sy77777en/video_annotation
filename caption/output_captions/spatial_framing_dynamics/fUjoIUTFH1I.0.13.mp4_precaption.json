    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot focusing on the entrance of a historic-style building. There is no main subject as the composition is designed to establish a sense of place and atmosphere, emphasizing the building's character rather than a specific entity. The off-white facade features a central arched wooden door, above which a sign reads \"HOTEL PROVINCIAL\" in golden lettering on a blue background. The entrance is flanked by two dark, gas-style lanterns and two blue shields bearing a coat of arms. On the second story, a window with light blue louvered shutters and an ornate black iron railing is visible. The scene is framed by the bare, dark branches of two trees, contributing to the cool, overcast ambiance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An eye-level shot captures the entrance of the Hotel Provincial on an overcast day, with a slightly shaky camera. The building features a light-colored facade with a central arched doorway containing dark wooden double doors. Above the entrance, a curved blue sign displays the hotel's name in gold lettering. The doorway is flanked by two black, vintage-style lanterns and two blue shields bearing coats of arms with gold and red details. The windows on the upper floor are adorned with light blue shutters and black wrought-iron railings. In the foreground, the bare branches of trees frame the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, eye-level scenery shot centered on the entrance of the Hotel Provincial, which is positioned in the middle ground. In the foreground, the bare branches of a tree frame the scene from the left, extending toward the top of the frame, while other branches are visible in the top right. The central arched doorway is flanked by two lanterns and two shields, placed symmetrically on its left and right sides in the middle ground. Directly above the door, the hotel's sign is located in the top-center of the frame, with a second-story window positioned above it. The camera remains mostly stationary, exhibiting only a slight, subtle shake throughout the clip.",
