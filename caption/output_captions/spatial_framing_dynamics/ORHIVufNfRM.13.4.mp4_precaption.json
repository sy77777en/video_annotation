    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video shows a first-person perspective of a dark, underwater, alien-like environment, framed by the red edges of a visor. The scene features massive, dark green, porous structures that resemble giant, gnarled tree trunks or coral formations, creating arches and columns. Attached to these large structures are clusters of reddish-orange, flat, mushroom-like organisms. Throughout the water, dense schools of small, bioluminescent creatures swim; these creatures have purple, fish-like bodies that glow with a vibrant green light. A few elongated animals glow with bright blue. The seabed below is sandy with patches of dark green growth.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, moves through a dark, alien underwater world. The scene is dominated by massive, dark, trunk-like formations with a porous texture, some arching over the sandy seabed while others stand straight like columns. Clusters of reddish-orange, mushroom-like growths sprout from these large structures. The teal water is filled with life, including swarms of tiny, glowing white particles, schools of small, fish-like creatures with purple bodies and bright green bioluminescent outlines that swim in coordinated patterns, and elongated creatures glowing bright blue. The camera glides forward, passing under one of the large arches. The entire view is framed by a red and black overlay, resembling the inside of a helmet or diving mask.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective framed by a visor, the scene is initially dominated by a large, porous structure in the right foreground, extending from the bottom to the top of the frame. In the middle ground, another large structure forms an arch from the top left towards the center, with reddish-orange growths attached to it. The sandy seabed occupies the bottom of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the background. Schools of green bioluminescent creatures are scattered in the middle ground, primarily around the structures. The camera moves forward and slightly left, passing under the central arch. As it advances, this arch transitions from the middle ground to the foreground, eventually moving over the top of the frame and out of view, revealing more of the underwater environment behind it. Simultaneously, a school of green creatures on the right moves from the middle ground toward the foreground before the camera passes them.",
