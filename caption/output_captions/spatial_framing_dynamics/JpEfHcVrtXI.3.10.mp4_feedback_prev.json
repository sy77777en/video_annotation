    "pre_caption": "In a wide, high-angle shot, a large man is positioned in the center-right middle ground, hunched over a wooden table. A small figure in yellow appears in the left middle ground, standing on a wooden crate. The figure jumps rightward onto a taller crate in the center-left middle ground, then leaps leftward to a grated wall in the background. As the figure begins to climb the wall on the far left of the frame, the camera pans left and tilts up to follow, causing the large man and the table to move out of the frame to the right. The camera's position shifts from a high angle to become level with the climbing figure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit room, a large, bald man with pale, wrinkled skin is hunched over a wooden table, illuminated by a single hanging bulb. He wears a dark, form-fitting shirt and is intently focused on putting sausages into his mouth on the blood-stained tabletop, where there are also piles of raw meat. Other similar bald men are visible either next to or opposite him. The main subject is a small, child-like figure who appears to be wearing a bright yellow raincoat with a gray hood that completely obscures their head and face. This figure navigates the scene by jumping from the table onto some wooden crates and then climbing a dark, grated wall, moving stealthily past the men who are eating.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the scene is set in a dark, indoor space. A single, bare light bulb hangs from a lampshade, casting a focused light on a wooden table where a large, bald figure is hunched over, eating sausages and meat. The table is stained and also holds a bucket of sausages and several wooden crates of different sizes, with a large pot visible on top of one of the crates. Other similar bald figures are near the main bald figure, and they all exit the frame as the camera moves. A small figure in yellow attire jumps from the table toward a crate, then to a larger crate, before finally jumping onto a dark, grid-like wall structure to the left and begins to climb upwards into the surrounding gloom.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
