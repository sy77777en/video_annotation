    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From the perspective of a car's back seat, a person wearing a solid blue helmet is visible in the driver's seat. The dashboard and the interior of the driver's seat are clearly visible, while most other elements in the car, including the seats, appear as silhouettes against the view through the windshield. Directly ahead is an orange car, with other vehicles faintly seen in the background. As the car moves forward, a parked gray car is seen passing by in the opposite direction from the left side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From the back seat of a car at night, the silhouettes of the two front seats and a rearview mirror frame the view through the windshield. A figure wearing a blue helmet sits in the driver's seat, facing forward. Outside, in a dark and hazy environment with visible trees, an orange car moves in sync with the camera, with other vehicles partially visible in the background. An overlay of white text appears as a subtitle in the bottom left corner of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows unknown of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "From a point-of-view perspective in the back seat of a car, the scene is framed by the silhouettes of the two front seats in the foreground, with the driver's seat on the left and the passenger's seat on the right. In the middle ground, a driver wearing a blue helmet is positioned on the left, with the car's dashboard and a central rearview mirror also visible. Through the windshield, an orange car is centrally located in the middle ground, with other indistinct vehicles and a hazy environment in the background. The camera, positioned at the level of a seated passenger, moves forward slowly, maintaining its distance from the orange car ahead. As the car advances, a gray car enters the frame from the left background and passes by, moving toward the left foreground.",
