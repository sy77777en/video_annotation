    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a man with brown skin is engaged in masonry work. He wears a light-colored shirt and a purple, black, and white patterned lower garment, with a black band on his right wrist. His left hand holds a rectangular, reddish-orange brick. His right hand grips a pointed masonry trowel with an orange handle and a mortar-stained blade. A green plastic bucket containing more wet, grey mortar is located near him, close to a partially constructed brick wall.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a scene at an outdoor construction site during the day. From this downward perspective, a person's hands are visible, holding a rectangular, reddish-orange brick in one hand and a trowel with gray-stained mortar in the other. A green bucket containing more mortar sits on the concrete ground near the partially constructed brick wall. Wet mortar is visible at the base of the wall. In the surrounding area, a large, gray concrete block with a white guide string rests nearby. Loose brick fragments are scattered across the concrete and dirt surface surrounding the person.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective looking down, the scene is framed with the person's torso and legs occupying the bottom center of the foreground. The person's left hand, holding a brick, is positioned in the center-left foreground, while their right hand, holding a trowel, is in the center-right foreground. In the middle ground, a green bucket is located on the left, a partially constructed brick wall is at the top left, and a large concrete block is at the top right. Greenery is visible in the background at the top left corner. The entire scene remains static, with no significant movement or change in spatial composition.",
