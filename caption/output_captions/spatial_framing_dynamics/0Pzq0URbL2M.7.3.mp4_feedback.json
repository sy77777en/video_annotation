    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot, captured from a high angle looking down. A person in a white lab coat occupies the right foreground, partially obscuring the view. In the middle ground, a collection of petri dishes is scattered across the center and left of a lab table. In the background, racks of test tubes and a flask are visible on the left. The camera then slowly pushes in and pans slightly to the left, transitioning into a full shot that focuses on the petri dishes. In the final framing, the dishes dominate the foreground and middle ground from the bottom left to the center, while the person on the right is now mostly out of the frame, with only a small part of their back visible in the right foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main focus is a collection of glass petri dishes resting on a white, scratched laboratory table. The dishes contain various cultures; one in the center is filled with lumpy, greenish growths, while others hold dark, murky liquids or streaked bacterial colonies. All of the dish lids are open, and a white cotton swab lies on the table nearby. A person, seen from the back and wearing a white lab coat, stands on the right side of the frame, partially obscuring the scene. In the background, other scientific equipment is visible, including a glass flask and two racks of test tubes: one filled with test tubes topped with red caps and another with no visible caps.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a laboratory, characterized by a cool, desaturated color palette. The focus is on a worn, white workbench cluttered with scientific equipment. Several glass petri dishes are scattered across the surface, all without lids, containing various cultures, including one with greenish, lumpy growths and others with dark liquids or streaked patterns. In the background, a rack holds test tubes,one of which filled with blue liquid, alongside another rack with test tubes that have red lids, as well as an Erlenmeyer flask and other glassware. A figure in a white lab coat stands on the right side of the scene, with their back partially toward the camera.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
