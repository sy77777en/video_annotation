    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with brown skin and short, dark, curly hair appears throughout the video, speaking and gesturing expressively. He is wearing a dark, long-sleeved, quarter-zip pullover with a bright yellow-green zipper and collar lining. On the left side of his chest, there is a white logo featuring the word \"SPUNK\" and a small emblem containing white, yellow, and dark colors. He has stubble on his face and uses various hand movements as he talks, including waving, pointing with both index fingers, and gesturing with open palms.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene is set during the day under a hazy, overcast sky. In the background, the faint, blurred outlines of buildings create an indistinct urban skyline against the uniform, pale-colored sky. A young man wearing a dark quarter-zip pullover with a lime green collar stands in the center of the composition. The video is framed with black letterbox bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a young man is consistently positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground of the scene, with a blurry urban skyline in the background. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout. Initially, the man raises his right arm, which occupies the upper-left portion of the frame. He then lowers his arm back to the center before raising both hands to the center of the frame to point forward. He concludes by lowering his hands to the bottom-center area, gesturing with open palms. His body stays centrally located while his arm movements create spatial dynamics within the frame.",
