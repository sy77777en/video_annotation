    "pre_caption": "This full shot, captured from the subjects' level, presents a centrally composed scene within a dark, misty space. In the middle ground, a person lies on a transparent pedestal located at the center of a circular platform, which occupies the bottom center of the frame. Five robed figures are arranged symmetrically around them: two stand on the left and two on the right in the middle ground, with a fifth figure positioned in the center background, forming a semi-circle. Beams of light descend from the top right, illuminating the central action. Throughout the shot, a white, web-like structure of particles materializes and swirls dynamically above the person on the pedestal in the center middle ground, while the camera and all figures remain stationary.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark, open space with a circular raised platform at the center, focused beams of cool white light illuminate the scene from above. A person in light-colored clothing lies on a translucent, crystalline table. A glowing, white, web-like structure made of dots materializes and moves over their body. Five skeletal figures dressed in dark, hooded robes stand symmetrically around the pedestal, their hands clasped in front of them as if in prayer or ritual, forming a semi-enclosed circle. Two figures are positioned on each side, with one in the middle, all focused on the person on the pedestal.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, empty space, a slightly elevated circular platform at the center supports a transparent pedestal. The background is enveloped in heavy shadows and a cool-toned mist. Multiple soft yet focused beams of cool white light descend at an angle, illuminating the center, while the surrounding area gradually fades into darkness. At the focal point, a figure lies upon the translucent pedestal. Five figures in dark, hooded robes, revealing skeletal features, stand in a circle around the pedestal with their hands clasped. A white, web-like field of energy particles materializes and swirls in the light above the central figure. The overall scene is rendered in dark, monochromatic tones.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
