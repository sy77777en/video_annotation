    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit setting, two white, featureless, mannequin-like figures walk deeper into the frame towards the right. The figure on the right has a masculine build and shoulder-length hair, while the figure to its left has a feminine form and wears a simple dress. To their right, a dark, 1980s-style two-door sedan is parked in the foreground, featuring a chrome trim line and hubcaps with gold-colored centers. Behind it is a light-colored, vintage sedan with a rounded, bulbous body shape. A third, dark car is positioned in the midground behind the vintage vehicle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit and hazy parking area at night, illuminated by a single overhead spotlight, two white, featureless figures walk past a line of parked cars. A dark, angular sedan is in the foreground, with a white, rounded vintage car visible behind it. The scene is characterized by a desaturated, greenish-gray color palette and strong shadows cast on the ground, which is marked with white parking lines. In the midground extending into the background, several thin vertical poles stand in the gloom. A white overlay with the text \"[10,17]\" is present in the bottom left corner of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot frames two white figures on the left side of the frame in the middle ground as they walk towards the right and deeper into the scene. A dark sedan is positioned in the foreground, occupying the bottom right quadrant and angled toward the left. In the middle ground, a light-colored vintage car is parked to the right of the figures' path, with a third dark car visible behind it. Several thin vertical poles are situated in the middle ground, extending from the left towards the center. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level.",
