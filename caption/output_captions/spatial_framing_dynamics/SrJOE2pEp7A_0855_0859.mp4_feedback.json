    "pre_caption": "A static shot shows a video editing software interface filling the screen. In the top-center portion of the frame, a preview window displays a video of four cameras arranged in a horizontal row in the middle ground, filmed from a camera positioned at their height. Below the preview, a timeline occupies the bottom half of the screen, where a red playhead travels from left to right. The main spatial change occurs as the white text \"SAMPLE TEXT\" fades into view in the foreground, remaining fixed in the center of the preview window and layered over the video of the cameras. Static interface panels are positioned on the left and right sides of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video shows a screen recording of a video editing software interface with a dark gray theme. In the main preview window, a video clip displays four cameras standing in a row: three are black, rectangular 360-degree cameras, with the one in the center bearing a \"LEICA\" logo, and the fourth camera on the far right is a taller, silver, rectangular model. Centered over the image of the cameras, the words \"SAMPLE TEXT\" in a white, sans-serif font fade into view. The lower half of the screen is occupied by a timeline with multiple video and audio tracks, including a title clip on the top track and a green audio waveform at the bottom. On the left side of the interface, a list of title effects is visible, with the \"Fade On\" option highlighted by a red outline.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a video editing software interface shows a project in progress. The layout features a central preview window displaying several black, vertical 360-degree cameras arranged in a row against a plain, light-colored background. Below this is a multi-track timeline with video clips, one showing thumbnails of a person's face, and an audio track with a green waveform. Panels flank the timeline and preview window, with a list of title effects on the left where \"Fade On\" is selected, and an inspector panel with text controls on the right. As the sequence progresses, the white, capitalized overlay text 'SAMPLE TEXT' fades into the center of the preview window over the cameras.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
