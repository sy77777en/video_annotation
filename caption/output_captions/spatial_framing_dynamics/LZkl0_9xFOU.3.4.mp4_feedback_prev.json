    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot from above, capturing a portion of a cluttered desk. Initially, a stack of hard drives is positioned in the middle ground, slightly left of center, with a portable cassette recorder to its right. In the background, an oscilloscope is visible at the top left and a computer tower is at the top right. The camera then pans slowly from right to left, revealing more of the desk. As the pan progresses, a Nintendo controller and a small circuit board enter the foreground near the center. The final frame shows the hard drives on the right side of the frame in the middle ground, a soldering station in the background on the top right, a digital clock in the background on the top left, and a motherboard with a fan in the middle ground on the far left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A desk with a green surface is cluttered with various electronic components and tools. A stack of three silver 3.5-inch internal hard drives with green and white labels sits next to a fourth, identical drive. Nearby is a small, silver and black portable cassette recorder with its tape door open and a black wrist strap attached. A classic gray Nintendo Entertainment System controller with red buttons and a black D-pad is connected by a wire to a small red circuit board. The workspace also features a black soldering station with a digital temperature display, a soldering iron, and a hot air gun. Other visible items include a black calculator, a black digital clock displaying \"12:08\", a large green motherboard, a black computer fan with a silver logo, and a black box with a small screen displaying a pink sine wave, consistent with an oscilloscope. A red box labeled \"Interface\" with green lights, various other circuit boards, and a tangle of black wires are also scattered across the desk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit room with cool, blue-toned lighting, a camera pans across a cluttered green desk laden with electronic equipment. The surface is covered with a variety of components, including a stack of 3.5-inch hard drives, a vintage portable audio recorder, and a classic video game controller. Wires connect these items to other devices, such as a small red interface box with green lights, various exposed circuit boards, a calculator, and a soldering station with digital temperature displays. In the background, a digital clock reads \"12:08,\" and an oscilloscope screen glows with a pink sine wave, positioned near a computer motherboard and a black computer tower.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
