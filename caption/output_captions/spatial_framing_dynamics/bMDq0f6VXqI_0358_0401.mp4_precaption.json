    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A digital illustration of a mountain landscape is displayed within a software interface. The scene features a large, rocky mountain with tan and brown cliffs and green, tree-covered lower slopes, set against a light blue sky with faint white clouds. In the foreground and midground, a dense forest of dark green pine trees is visible. Among the trees stands a brown wooden utility pole with a single crossbar, giving it the appearance of a cross. To the right of the main composition, a single, tall, dark green pine tree is isolated against a transparent checkerboard background, indicating it is a separate visual element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, shown from a screen recording of a software or system interface, takes place within a digital workspace featuring a layered composition window. The main area displays a stylized landscape with green pine trees in the foreground, a wooden utility pole, and a large rocky mountain under a blue sky with scattered clouds. The interface includes multiple panels, such as a timeline with colored bars and labeled tracks at the bottom, and various toolbars and menus along the top and sides. The workspace background is dark, contrasting with the lighter scene in the composition window. Overlay elements include window borders, icons, and text labels that are part of the software interface, clearly separated from the illustrated landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The static scene is presented within a software interface, where a central composition window displays a layered digital illustration from an angled, slightly elevated perspective. Within this illustration, a mountain under a blue sky forms the background, occupying the upper portion of the artwork. In the middle ground, a forest of trees and a centrally located wooden utility pole are positioned at the base of the mountain. A cluster of darker trees sits in the foreground on the left side of the artwork. To the right of this main composition, a single, separate tree layer stands in the foreground against a transparent background. Wireframe guides visible in the workspace reveal the 3D spatial separation between these layers, showing them as flat planes arranged at different depths.",
