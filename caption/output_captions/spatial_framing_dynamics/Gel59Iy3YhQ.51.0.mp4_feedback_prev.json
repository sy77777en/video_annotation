    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the camera is positioned above an ornate, circular platform that occupies the bottom of the frame, looking forward. In the foreground, a complex metallic object is partially visible on the right, while HUD elements are fixed in the top-left, bottom-left, and top-right corners. Initially, a single post with a glowing cyan orb stands in the center foreground on the platform. The platform moves forward through a milky, blue-green river in the middle ground, which is flanked by rocky cavern walls. As it advances, a second glowing post slides into view from the left, positioning itself in the left foreground. The entire platform and camera then pass through a rocky archway, entering a wider section of the river, with the dark cavern walls and distant pale structures remaining in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A first-person perspective from inside the cockpit of a small flying vehicle or probe shows a view over a circular, brown-colored platform with intricate, carved patterns. Rising from this platform are two posts, each topped with a glowing, cyan-colored orb. The view is framed by a heads-up display (HUD) that includes several elements: in the top left, a circular gauge with a human silhouette shows meters for \"O2\" and \"FUEL,\" with the fuel at 100%; in the bottom left, the text and value for \"GRAVITY\" are displayed, with a white, crosshair-like player orientation indicator below it; and text prompts for \"Focus\" and \"Conceal\" are in the top right. On the right side of the screen, a complex, metallic object with ornate designs is partially visible. The player is in the cockpit, drifting along a blue-green river surrounded by rocks, passing through an arched rock formation and entering a wider body of water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a journey through a dark, rocky cavern. The perspective is from an ornate, circular platform with four pillars, each topped with spheres that alternate between a non-luminous green state and a glowing cyan state, illuminating the immediate surroundings. The platform glides through a body of milky, light-blue water, causing splashes and ripples around it. In the background, pale, tree-like structures stand against the dark cavern walls. The view is framed by a heads-up display (HUD) with several elements: in the top left, a circular gauge with a human silhouette displays meters for \"O2\" and \"FUEL,\" with the fuel level at 100%; in the bottom left, the \"GRAVITY\" text and value are shown, accompanied by a white, crosshair-like player orientation indicator below it. Text prompts for \"Focus\" and \"Conceal\" appear in the top right. Additionally, a complex, metallic object with ornate designs is partially visible on the right side of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
