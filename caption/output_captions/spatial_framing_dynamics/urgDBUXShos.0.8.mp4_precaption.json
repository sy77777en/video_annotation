    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, seen from over his right shoulder, confronts a woman in a close-up shot. The man has messy, wavy, blondish-green hair and is wearing a purple jacket. His face, partially visible, is covered in white makeup with dark coloration around his mouth. His right hand, clad in a purple leather glove, cups the right cheek of the light-skinned woman. The woman has brown hair pulled back, a dark sleeveless top, and a small earring in her left ear; her expression is tense. The man holds a metallic knife, positioning the blade near the corner of the woman's mouth.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, captures an indoor scene at a nighttime social gathering. The environment is dimly lit, with out-of-focus figures in formal wear visible in the dark background. From this perspective, a figure in a purple coat is seen up close with a woman who has her brown hair styled up and is wearing a dark dress and a small earring. The figure's hand, clad in a purple leather glove, rests on the woman's cheek. During the scene, the tip of a small, metallic knife blade emerges from the gloved hand and is pressed against the woman's face near her mouth.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a close-up, over-the-shoulder shot, a man's head and shoulder occupy the foreground on the left side of the frame. A woman is positioned in the middle ground on the right, facing him. The man's gloved hand, also in the middle ground, cups the woman's right cheek. In the background, out-of-focus figures are visible. During the shot, a metallic knife blade emerges from the man's hand in the middle ground and is placed against the corner of the woman's mouth. The camera remains static and positioned at the subjects' level throughout the action.",
