    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a medium skin tone, wearing a maroon t-shirt and dark blue jeans with a black belt, holds a rectangular photograph over a round, metallic bowl filled with gray ash. Using a lit, black, flip-top lighter in his right hand, he sets the bottom of the photograph on fire. The photo is a headshot of an older, light-skinned man with short black hair and a slight smile, wearing a white collared shirt. The man then drops the burning photograph into the bowl.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit outdoor setting on a wooden deck, a person holds a rectangular photograph of an older, bald man over a metallic, bronze-colored bowl. The bowl, filled with grey ash, sits on a light-colored wooden railing. Using a black flip-top lighter, the person ignites the bottom of the photograph. The flame spreads across the paper before the person releases the burning photo into the bowl. The background is softly blurred, showing an indistinct natural environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video uses a close-up shot, framing the man\u2019s torso and hands as the main subject, with his arms and the objects he holds occupying the center and lower center of the frame in the foreground. The man\u2019s hands, holding a photograph and a lighter, are positioned just above a round metallic bowl filled with ash, which sits on a wooden railing at the bottom center of the frame in the foreground. The photograph, initially held above the bowl, is set on fire with the lighter, and then dropped directly downward into the bowl, remaining in the foreground and center of the frame throughout the action. The camera remains at the same height as the man\u2019s hands and the bowl, maintaining a level perspective. The background, which is softly blurred, occupies the upper part of the frame and remains in the background, showing indistinct outdoor scenery with no major elements drawing focus away from the central action. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera angle, and the spatial dynamics are defined by the downward movement of the photograph from the man\u2019s hand into the bowl.",
