    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The interior of a light-colored, vintage Volkswagen Beetle is visible through its open driver's side door. The passenger seat is conspicuously absent, and in its place on the floor is a collection of items: a coil of rope, a pair of white gloves, a dark flashlight, a length of chain, and a white mask with a red object placed on top of it. The driver's seat is a simple, light-gray upholstered seat, positioned in front of a dark, three-spoke steering wheel. A person in a dark outfit with bright red gloves and a bright red face, along with shoulder-length black hair, stands outside the car, looking in through the rear passenger-side window.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, the interior of a light-colored vintage Volkswagen Beetle is viewed from the outside through the open driver's side door. The car's interior is illuminated, showing a simple dashboard and steering wheel. The front passenger seat is missing, and on the floor in its place are a coil of rope, a white mask with a red object on top, a pair of white gloves, and a black flashlight. A silhouetted figure in a dark outfit with red gloves stands outside the passenger window, looking in. An overlay of white text is located in the bottom left corner of the screen and reads \"[3]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene is presented in a medium shot from a high angle, looking down into a car's interior through the open driver's side door, which occupies the left foreground. The car's interior fills the center and right of the frame, extending from the middle ground to the background. In the center-left middle ground is the driver's seat, with the steering wheel in front of it. A collection of items rests on the floor in the center middle ground, where a passenger seat would be. A figure wearing red gloves is positioned in the right foreground, looking into the car through the rear window. The camera slowly pans to the right and lowers its angle, shifting the perspective to be more level with the car's window line and bringing the items on the floor into greater focus.",
