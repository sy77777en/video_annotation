    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a high-angle cityscape scenery shot capturing a sprawling European city with a dense collection of buildings featuring characteristic terracotta-tiled roofs and ochre-colored walls. In the foreground on the left, a tall, ornate Gothic bell tower, constructed from ochre and black materials, rises majestically, providing a sense of scale. The tower is characterized by intricate geometric patterns, decorative stonework, arched windows, and layered sections. The view extends over the rooftops, revealing narrow streets bustling with tiny figures of people, and stretches towards rolling green hills in the distant background. There is no single main subject; the composition is designed to emphasize the grand scale and historic atmosphere of the urban environment rather than focusing on a specific element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, a sunlit, sprawling cityscape of Florence, Italy, is seen during the daytime. On the left, the ornate, slender form of Giotto's Campanile, a bell tower with ochre and dark marble patterns and Gothic windows, rises into view. In the foreground, the long, brown-tiled roof of the Florence Cathedral stretches towards the center. The dense urban environment is characterized by yellow and ochre-colored buildings with terracotta roofs, separated by narrow streets where small figures of people can be seen walking. In the far distance, green, rolling hills are visible under a bright sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.",
