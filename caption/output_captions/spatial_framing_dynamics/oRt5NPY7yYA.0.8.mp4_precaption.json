    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An aerial, top-down view shows a convoy of vehicles traveling on a multi-lane highway through a desert landscape. The convoy consists of a dark-colored car at the front, followed by three green, military-style armored vehicles in front of a large, white semi-trailer truck. Two more green armored vehicles are positioned behind the truck, with another dark-colored car at the rear of the formation. During the sequence, the green military vehicles are highlighted with a bright green glow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a top-down view of a convoy of vehicles traveling from right to left along a two-lane highway that cuts through a vast, arid desert landscape. The dark asphalt road features white dashed lane markings and solid yellow edge lines. The convoy includes several olive-green military-style vehicles, a large semi-truck with a long white trailer, and dark-colored cars positioned at the front and back. The surrounding desert terrain is a dusty, light-brown color with a hazy atmosphere. As the convoy proceeds, a green glowing effect is overlaid on the military vehicles, highlighting them.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot, captured from a direct top-down perspective, shows a multi-lane highway running horizontally across the center of the frame, set against a vast desert landscape that occupies the top and bottom portions. A convoy of vehicles, positioned in the middle ground, travels from right to left along the highway. Initially, the formation consists of a dark car on the left, followed by several green military vehicles, a white semi-truck, and another military vehicle. As the sequence progresses, additional military vehicles and a second dark car enter the frame from the right, extending the length of the convoy while maintaining a consistent formation. Throughout the shot, a green glow is overlaid on the military vehicles, highlighting their positions within the centrally-framed group.",
