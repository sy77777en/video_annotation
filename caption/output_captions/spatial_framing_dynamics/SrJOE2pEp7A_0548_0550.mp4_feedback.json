    "pre_caption": "The scene is a screen recording of a video editing interface, where a video preview window is located in the top center and a timeline occupies the bottom half. Within the preview window, a man is framed in a medium shot, centered and at eye level with the camera. He is positioned in the middle ground of his own scene, with a window in the background to his left and a wall of graphics behind him. During the clip, the man raises his hands from below the frame into the foreground of his shot to gesture. Synchronized with this action, a red playhead on the timeline below moves from left to right across the video and audio tracks. Static control panels are positioned on the left and right sides of the overall interface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video shows a screen recording of a video editing software interface, which features a clip of a light-skinned man. The man, appearing to be in his 30s or 40s, has short dark hair, a trimmed beard and mustache, and is wearing a black short-sleeved shirt. He is centered, shown from the chest up, and speaks while gesturing with his hands. The surrounding software interface has a dark theme and is organized into several panels, including a video preview window displaying the man, and a timeline below with video and audio tracks. The audio tracks are visualized as green waveforms.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a video editing software interface shows a project titled \"My Vlog\" within DaVinci Resolve. The dark-themed interface is organized with a video preview window at the top center, a multi-track timeline below it, and various control panels on the left and right. The preview window displays a man in a dark shirt sitting indoors, with a white slatted window and a wall of colorful square graphics extending from the midground to the background. The timeline below contains video clips, represented by a series of thumbnails of the man in a blue editing track, and the corresponding audio tracks are green. A red playhead indicates the current position in the edit. Panels on the sides, labeled \"Master,\" \"ES_Hemisphere - Ooyy.wav,\" and \"Titles,\" display various editing options and controls. The man's hands are shown when he gestures, corresponding to the progression on the timeline.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
