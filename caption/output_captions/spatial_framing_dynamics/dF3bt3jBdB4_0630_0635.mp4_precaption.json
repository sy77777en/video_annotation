    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on a young, light-skinned boy with brown hair floating in the ocean, holding onto a light blue and white boogie board. He wears blue and white swim goggles and a blue and orange snorkel. In the background, a large white and black catamaran with a tall mast and the name \"Kai Kanani II\" on its side is visible. The camera then submerges, and the boy and the boat are no longer in view. The scene transitions to an underwater view of a large, textured coral reef, which is mostly light green and beige. Small, spiny sea urchins and other small red marine creatures are scattered across the coral.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins on the surface of a calm, blue-green ocean during the day, under a blue sky with white clouds. A white and black catamaran with \"Kai Kanani II\" written on its side is anchored in the middle ground, near a distant shoreline with palm trees. A person wearing a snorkel mask floats on a blue and white boogie board. The view then submerges, transitioning to an underwater perspective that glides over an expansive coral reef. The reef consists of light green and beige formations with varied textures, set against the turquoise-green water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, where a boy on a boogie board is positioned in the center-left foreground, at eye level with the camera. To the right, a catamaran sits in the middle ground, with a distant shoreline in the background on the far right. The camera then moves downward, submerging beneath the water's surface, causing the boy and the boat to disappear from the frame. The view transitions to an underwater perspective, with the camera positioned above a large coral reef that fills the bottom and center of the frame. The camera then glides forward and pans slightly to the right, moving over the reef and revealing its expansive, textured surface in the foreground and middle ground.",
