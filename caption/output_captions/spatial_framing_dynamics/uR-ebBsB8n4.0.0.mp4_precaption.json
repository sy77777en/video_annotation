    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a scenery shot captured from inside a small aircraft, looking out at a teal-tinted sky filled with clouds. A large, vibrant rainbow arches across the view, with a fainter, secondary rainbow visible just outside of it. Far below, a sprawling cityscape is visible in the distance. The scene is framed by interior parts of the aircraft, including a dark, scuffed dashboard at the bottom of the frame and a light-colored side window through which a white, cylindrical wing strut can be seen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video opens with a view of a double rainbow arching across a teal-tinted, cloudy sky, as seen through the front window of a small airplane. Below, the sprawling cityscape is visible, with scattered lights dotting the landscape. Inside the cockpit, the black dashboard is prominently visible. As the perspective shifts to the side window, the rainbow remains in view, along with the ground below, framed by the white wing struts and a portion of the white wing.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a scenery shot captured from inside a helicopter in the sky. The frame includes part of the helicopter, as well as distant scenery, which also features a rainbow.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a scenery shot from a high-altitude perspective inside an aircraft, with the dashboard in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A double rainbow arches across the middle ground, stretching from the lower left towards the upper right. In the background, a cityscape is visible below the rainbow, and a cloudy, teal-tinted sky fills the upper two-thirds of the frame. The camera then pans to the right, transitioning the view to a side window. In this final framing, the window frame and a vertical wing strut are in the foreground on the left, while the rainbow is repositioned in the middle ground, now arching from the bottom right. The ground remains visible in the background through the window.",
