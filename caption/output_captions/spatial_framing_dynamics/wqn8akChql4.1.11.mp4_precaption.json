    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an aerial disaster scenery shot, capturing the catastrophic destruction of a large football stadium. From a high-angle perspective, the circular structure, identified by a sign as \"GIANTS STADIUM,\" is engulfed by a massive, dark, swirling shockwave that tears it apart. The stadium, with its visible red seating and green field, crumbles and disintegrates as the immense force sweeps over it. The focus is not on a specific character or object but on the overwhelming scale and power of the destructive event, emphasizing the environmental catastrophe and the atmosphere of devastation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a high-angle, aerial view of Giants Stadium being engulfed by a massive, dark, swirling cloud of dust and debris. The oval-shaped stadium, featuring red seating and a green football field, is situated in a vast, gray parking lot under an overcast sky. A banner on the exterior reads \"2007 WORLD CHAMPIONS\" and \"NEW YORK GIANTS.\" The dark, turbulent mass rapidly advances, crashing into the structure and causing it to violently break apart and crumble under the force.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot presented as an extreme wide shot from a high-angle perspective. Initially, Giants Stadium is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. A large, dark, swirling mass is visible in the background at the top of the frame. This mass rapidly moves from the background toward the foreground, advancing across the scene. As it reaches the middle ground, it engulfs the centrally located stadium, causing the structure to break apart and disintegrate. The camera maintains its high-angle position, observing the destruction as the mass continues to sweep across the entire frame from top to bottom.",
