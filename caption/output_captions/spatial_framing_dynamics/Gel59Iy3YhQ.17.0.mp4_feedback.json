    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a small figure hangs from a cable in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. A large net stretches horizontally across the middle ground below the figure, with several boxes resting on it. The top of the frame is obscured by a dark structure in the foreground. The camera pans down and zooms out slightly as the figure detaches from the cable and falls. The figure descends from the center of the frame toward the bottom, moving deeper into the background. As it falls, small, fish-like shapes become visible swimming in the background in the lower half of the scene. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a small, pale-skinned humanoid figure, possibly a child, wearing dark shorts and a small, glowing yellow light on its chest. The figure is initially seen hanging from a thin, dark cable above a large, dark, web-like net. Several black, rectangular boxes are scattered across this net. The figure then detaches from the cable, creating a small puff of white vapor, and falls into the dark, murky space below. As it descends, several small, dark, fish-like shapes can be seen swimming in the gloom.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a vast, dark, and cavernous indoor space, a large, sagging net is suspended horizontally, holding several dark, box-like objects. A small figure, distinguished by a single point of yellow light on its torso, hangs from a thin wire above the net. The figure detaches from the wire and falls into the dark expanse below, where small, dark, fish-like shapes are seen swimming. The environment is rendered in a nearly monochromatic palette of dark grays and blacks, with indistinct industrial structures and cables in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
