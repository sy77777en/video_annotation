    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a square, gray stone pedestal with a scratched, worn texture. On this pedestal, a cube with a primarily light blue front face and a reflective side that appears gold is positioned between two circular discs patterned with yellow and black diagonal stripes. A large, cylindrical stone column, matching the pedestal's texture, is positioned above the top disc. The scene then shifts to a similar stone pedestal, which supports a single striped disc and an identical blue cube with reflective sides. A large, dark, rusty-looking metallic sphere then falls from above, striking the cube and causing it to shatter into numerous small, dark fragments. The sphere comes to rest on the striped disc, surrounded by the debris.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, industrial setting, a large, scratched metal cube rests on the floor, serving as a base for a vertical metal cylinder. Two circular rings, marked with yellow and black diagonal hazard stripes, are positioned around the cylinder. A translucent, light blue cube is initially held between these two rings. A rusty, textured metal sphere then falls from above, shattering the blue cube and sending small fragments flying outward before coming to rest on the lower ring. The scene is illuminated by a focused light source against a solid black background.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a dark background with a square stone pedestal, upon which a cube is being pressed by a stone column from above. Yellow and black striped circular discs are placed above and below the cube. The camera quickly moves to the right, revealing another square stone pedestal with a cube on it and a yellow and black striped disc beneath the cube. A spherical object then falls from the top of the frame and crushes the cube.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, centrally framing a stone pedestal in the foreground. In the middle ground, a light blue cube is positioned between two striped discs, with a large stone column extending from the center-top of the frame. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, then quickly moves to the right, revealing a new composition. In this second shot, another stone pedestal is centered in the foreground, supporting a cube and a single striped disc in the middle ground. A spherical object then enters from the top of the frame and falls vertically downward, striking the centrally located cube. The cube shatters, and its fragments scatter outward from the center across the foreground and middle ground, while the sphere comes to rest in the center of the frame where the cube was previously located.",
