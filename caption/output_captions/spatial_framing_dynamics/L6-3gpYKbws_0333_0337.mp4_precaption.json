    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with dark hair and a medium skin tone, wearing blue swim trunks, is seen from the side or the back swimming in clear, turquoise water. Subsequently, another person appears, snorkeling in the same water. This person is wearing a top, a black and orange snorkel mask, and a black snorkel with an orange tip. They are shown both on the surface and diving underwater, while the first person is not visible after diving underwater.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at a beach in Klein Cura\u00e7ao during the daytime, under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. The view shifts from above the clear, turquoise water to an underwater perspective. At the beginning of the video, a person swims away from the camera, creating splashes in the water. On the shore, a white sandy beach is lined with low green vegetation and a few simple, rustic buildings, one of which is white with a green interior and a corrugated metal roof. A person is swimming and snorkeling in the water, which reveals underwater rock formations. Throughout the video, an overlay of white text in the bottom left corner reads \"Klein Cura\u00e7ao.\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is now on the sea surface, showing a swimming person and the distant scenery, which is a wide shot. Then the camera pans left and moves downward to show another swimming person and the underwater scenery.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from the water's surface, showing a person swimming away from the camera in the middle ground, moving from the center towards the right. A shoreline with buildings occupies the background across the top of the frame. After a large splash erupts in the foreground, the camera pans left to frame a snorkeler swimming from the left towards the center in the middle ground. The camera then tilts down, submerging for an underwater view. In this final shot, the camera is positioned above the snorkeler, who is now on the right side of the frame, diving downwards in the middle ground next to a rock formation that extends from the foreground to the middle ground on the right. The sandy seabed is visible in the background on the left. A text overlay remains in the bottom left foreground throughout.",
