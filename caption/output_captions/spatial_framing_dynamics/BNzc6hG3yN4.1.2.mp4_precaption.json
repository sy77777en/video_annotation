    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From an overhead perspective, a Black man with cornrows stands on a gray surface, looking up and smiling. He is wearing a black jacket, black pants, and dark shoes with white soles. Standing beside him are two other individuals, one of whom is wearing a gray and black plaid jacket. Next to the central man is a four-wheeled ATV parked upright, featuring a purple seat and a body adorned with a colorful blue, pink, yellow, and white pattern. A smaller, blue ATV is also parked upright in the lower right corner, with a man in a yellow shirt seated on it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a top-down perspective, the scene is set on a wide, gray paved surface. Positioned on the ground are several people and two all-terrain vehicles. One larger ATV features a light blue base color with patterns in blue, yellow, white, and pink, and a textured purple seat. A smaller, blue ATV is partially visible in the lower right. A person dressed in black is standing near the center of the frame at an inverted angle, while other individuals are also standing at an inverted angle at the bottom of the view. A motorcycle wheel is visible on the left. The lighting is even and diffuse.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a full, top-down shot where all subjects are positioned on a flat, gray surface. A man in black lies on his back in the center of the frame, oriented with his head toward the bottom. To his right, a large, colorful ATV is positioned in the top right quadrant. At the bottom of the frame, two other people are also lying on their backs. A smaller, blue ATV is partially visible in the bottom right corner, while a single wheel is seen in the bottom left corner. The camera remains static and positioned directly above the scene.",
