    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot showing an ice hockey player (#26) in the center-left of the frame, skating in the middle ground away from the goal, which is positioned on the right. As he skates, the camera zooms in, transitioning to a medium shot that keeps him centered. He is quickly joined by teammates who enter from the right and left sides of the frame, converging in the center to form a celebratory huddle in the middle ground. During this huddle, an opposing player skates past in the background on the right, and another opposing player is partially visible in the bottom right foreground. The entire sequence is captured from a camera positioned above the players.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of male ice hockey players in gold and black uniforms celebrate on the ice. A player with the name \"UHER\" and the number \"26\" on the back of his gold, black, and white jersey is the first to celebrate. He is quickly joined by his teammates, including a player with an indistinct name and the number \"16\" on his back, another with \"SAMUELSSON\" and the number \"5\", and a third player with an indistinct name and the number \"8\". They all wear matching uniforms with white helmets, black pants, and black gloves, and they come together in a group hug. In the midground around them are players from the opposing team in dark blue, red, and white jerseys. Their goalie is on his knees on the ice in front of the net, wearing large white pads and a matching dark blue uniform.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at an indoor ice hockey rink with a white ice surface marked by a red circle and lines. The rink is enclosed by white boards featuring prominent advertisements, including a large blue and green \"Commonwealth Health\" logo and a blue and red \"AHL TheAHL.com\" logo. A clear protective barrier sits atop the boards. On the right, a hockey goal with a white net is visible. Several hockey players are on the ice. A group of players wearing gold, black, and white uniforms skates together and gathers in a celebratory huddle, while other players in dark blue and red uniforms are skating around the ice.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
