    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a medium shot, three separate images of individuals have been combined to create the appearance of them being seated together in a television studio setting. In the center of the frame is a woman with light skin and long, straight brown hair, wearing a white jacket over a black top, with a serious expression as she looks forward. On the left side of the frame is a man with light skin, short, dark, receding hair, and a clean-shaven face, dressed in a beige suit jacket and a white shirt, looking down at a paper in his hands. On the right side of the frame is another man with light skin, short dark hair, and a full dark beard and mustache, wearing a dark blue suit, a white shirt, and a dark blue tie, sitting with his hands clasped and a serious expression on his face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a broadcast-style viewpoint typical of television production, capturing an indoor studio setting. The background predominantly features red and black colors, accented by white light strips and some blue lettering. The images of three individuals have been digitally combined, with a man in a tan jacket on the left, a woman in a white jacket in the center, and a man in a blue suit on the right. A prominent red overlay banner is positioned at the bottom of the screen, displaying the white text '\u00c7\u0130FTL\u0130K BANK TARTI\u015eMASI' in the center, 'TELEFON' on the left, 'GECE G\u00d6R\u00dc\u015e\u00dc' to the right of the center, and the 'CNN T\u00dcRK' logo on the far right. Just above the banner on the left side, another overlay shows the text 'MEHMET \u00c7EV\u0130K - T\u0130YATROCU' in white, next to a small CNN logo.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: It's a TV program, showing a woman in the center with two men on either side. Each person is shown in a separate medium shot, occupying one-third of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It's a TV program , showing a woman in the center with two men on either side. Each person is shown in a separate medium shot, occupying one-third of the frame. They are filmed with different cameras and backgrounds. All three are filmed at their level.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene is composed of three separate medium shots, digitally combined to appear as a single panel. A woman occupies the center of the frame, with one man positioned to her left and another to her right, each filling roughly one-third of the screen. All three subjects are situated in the middle ground of their respective shots, with distinct studio backgrounds behind them. In the foreground, a large red graphic banner spans the bottom of the screen, featuring text elements across its length. Just above this banner, a smaller text overlay is positioned in the bottom-left quadrant. The camera maintains a static position throughout, filming all three subjects at their eye level.",
