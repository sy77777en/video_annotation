    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a small, stylized human character with light skin, dark hair, and a brown hooded cap, wearing a red shirt and moving along a set of narrow wooden and metal minecart tracks that cross over a dirt path bordered by dark materials on both sides. The character is holding a tool, possibly a piece of minecart tracks, and has a blocky and pixelated appearance, consistent with a retro video game style. Several yellow-orange torches, each mounted on short posts, are spaced evenly along the minecart tracks and nearby ground, casting light on the scene. A large, orange mushroom with a thick stem and wide cap is visible near the tracks, accompanied by a smaller mushroom, both of which eventually go out of frame. Other creatures are scattered in the scene. The ground is scattered with small green patches and stones, and the overall setting suggests an underground or cavernous environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides, shows a scene inside a dark, underground cave. A horizontal minecart track runs across the middle of the screen, crossing over a dirt path bordered by dark materials on both sides. The cave, made of brown earth and rock, is illuminated by numerous torches on the walls and ground, casting a warm glow. On the left, there is a body of dark water, which later goes out of frame as the camera moves, and the dirt ground features patches of green plants around the scene. Initially beside the track, a large, orange-capped mushroom with another smaller mushroom is visible; they also go out of frame later due to camera movement. A small, pixelated character moves from left to right along the track, and the camera follows, revealing a stone archway from the lower right and gradually moving to the lower left. Overlays are visible on the screen, including a status bar in the top left, a mini-map in the top right, an inventory hotbar at the bottom, and controller button prompts in the bottom right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In this extreme wide shot captured from a high-angle, top-down perspective, a pixelated character is initially positioned in the middle ground on the left side of the frame, standing on a minecart track that runs horizontally across the scene. A body of dark water occupies the foreground on the left, with torches and mushrooms scattered in the middle ground nearby. As the character moves from left to right along the track, the camera pans right, keeping the character in the middle ground. This movement causes the water and mushrooms to exit the frame on the left, while revealing more of the cavern and a stone archway that enters from the bottom right and shifts toward the bottom left. Throughout the video, UI elements, including a status bar, mini-map, and inventory, remain in fixed positions at the top, bottom, and corners of the screen.",
