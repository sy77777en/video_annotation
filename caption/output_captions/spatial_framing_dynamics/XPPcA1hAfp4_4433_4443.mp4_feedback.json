    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a high-angle, top-down perspective, a pixelated character is initially positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, on a wooden bridge that spans a dark body of water. On the right side of the frame, also in the middle ground, a grey, mound-like creature is stationary, while a small, winged creature flutters in the bottom-right area. The winged creature moves toward the mound-like creature on the right. Subsequently, the main character walks left off the bridge and onto a sandy bank in the left middle ground, where a four-legged animal briefly appears on the left side of the frame. The character then moves back to the center of the bridge, and the winged creature flies from the right side of the frame to hover around the character in the center. The camera remains static, with UI elements fixed in the top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-center of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pixelated character, who appears to be a person with dark hair wearing a brown hooded red top and blue pants, is the central figure. On a bank to the right, a grey, mound-like creature with a rocky texture is present. A small, winged creature with a glowing yellow outline and yellow dots resembling eyes flutters in the scene. Briefly, a white, four-legged animal with a prominent, fluffy pink and purple mane and orange horns appears on the bank to the left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides, depicts a pixel art scene set in a dark, outdoor environment. The area is illuminated by torches and features a large, dark body of water crossed by a simple wooden bridge. The left portion of the bridge is initially covered by dark materials, which the character later clears. To the right of the water, minecart tracks run along a path of dirt and grass. On this path, a grey, mound-shaped creature is present. On the left side of the water, a sandy area contains an orange-leafed tree, barrels, and crates. A character stands and moves on the bridge while a small, winged creature initially flies around the path of dirt and grass, and later flies near the character. The scene includes several overlay elements: a status bar in the top-left corner, a mini-map in the top-right, a hotbar with tools at the bottom-center, and controller prompts in the bottom-right. Temporary overlays include a text box in the bottom right that appears in the first part of the video reading \"Swap hotbar up Shortcut: R3+R1,\" with R3 and R1 outlined by simple shapes. The number \"1\" intermittently appears around the mound-shaped creature when it is attacked by the flying creature, and the number \"34\" appears when the character first passes by a four-legged creature to the left of the bridge.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
