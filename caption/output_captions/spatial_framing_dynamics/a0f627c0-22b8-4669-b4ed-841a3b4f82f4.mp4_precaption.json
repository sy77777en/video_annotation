    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot set within a dense bamboo forest, characterized by a focus-pulling technique. The view transitions from a soft, abstract blur of shimmering bokeh created by light filtering through the canopy to a slightly clearer image, revealing the tall, dark green, segmented stalks of bamboo. There is no main subject because the shot is atmospheric, designed to immerse the viewer in the tranquil and enveloping environment. The focus is on the overall texture, light, and feeling of the forest rather than a specific object within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dense, shaded bamboo forest. Initially, the view is out of focus, rendering the light filtering through the high canopy as soft, circular bokeh against a green backdrop. The focus then pulls to reveal numerous tall, dark green bamboo stalks, their segmented forms standing vertically throughout the environment. The overall lighting is dim, with brighter light visible through the leaves at the top of the forest.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot of a dense bamboo forest begins completely out of focus, presenting a view of dark, vertical shapes and bright, circular bokeh scattered across the frame. Numerous bamboo stalks are positioned vertically throughout the scene, creating layers in the foreground, middle ground, and background. A focus pull transitions the view, bringing the stalks in the middle ground into slightly sharper focus while the foreground and the background canopy remain blurred. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up towards the tops of the tall bamboo.",
