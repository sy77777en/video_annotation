    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A reddish-brown motorboat with a white windshield frame and an open cabin travels through the water. An indistinct flag with red, green, and white colors is on its stern. A man wearing a white short-sleeved shirt is visible steering the boat from inside the cabin. Along the shoreline to the left, the large, ornate Doge's Palace with its white and beige arched facade is visible, alongside the tall, red-brick St. Mark's Campanile. As the viewpoint moves forward and overtakes the motorboat from the front, the boat and its driver exit the frame at the bottom center.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a polished motorboat speeding across the open water of the Venetian Lagoon in Venice, Italy. The camera follows behind the vessel, hovering just above the churning white foam of the wake as the boat moves away. As the viewpoint moves forward and overtakes the motorboat from the front, the boat and its driver exit the frame at the bottom center. The historic waterfront is situated in the upper portion of the frame, extending from left to right. In the upper-left, the distinctive Doge's Palace with its Gothic arches and patterned facade stands alongside the towering red-brick Campanile di San Marco. The sun sits low on the horizon to the right, creating a bright glare and casting golden reflections across the dark teal, rippling water, suggesting late afternoon or sunset. The sky is a clear gradient of blue, transitioning to bright white near the sun, while the distant shoreline is lined with a continuous row of historic buildings.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a motorboat positioned in the center of the frame within the middle ground, cutting through the water and generating a foamy wake in the bottom foreground. The camera is positioned above the subject, capturing the scene from an aerial perspective. In the background, the historic waterfront extends across the horizon, with the Doge's Palace and Campanile situated in the upper left and center, while the sun shines brightly in the top right. As the camera moves forward rapidly, the boat transitions from the middle ground to the immediate foreground at the bottom center. The camera eventually overtakes the vessel, causing the boat to exit the frame at the bottom center, shifting the focus entirely to the open water in the foreground and the architectural skyline in the background.",
