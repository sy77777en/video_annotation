    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a middle-aged man with fair skin and short, light-colored hair. He is wearing a full-body, long-sleeved, light blue-grey wetsuit with a black device encircling his neck, connected to a nose clip by a black string. He is shown both underwater, where he removes the nose clip, and at the surface of the water, where he takes a large breath. A second person is also present, seen underwater near the man. This person wears a black wetsuit, a white-framed diving mask, a white snorkel, and black and white fins.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins with an overhead underwater view in deep blue water, with a sandy seabed visible far below. The perspective then transitions to the surface of the choppy sea during the daytime. In the background, a coastline with arid, brown mountains stretches under a clear, pale purple sky. A white text overlay is present at the bottom of the screen, which reads, \"i have a depth wish,\" and eventually disappears.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a high-angle perspective, looking down at two divers in the middle ground. The main subject is in the center-left of the frame, and a second diver is to his right, both suspended above the distant seabed in the background. A text overlay is visible in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The scene then cuts to a medium shot at the water's surface, with the camera positioned at the subject's level. The main subject emerges in the center-left middle ground, with the water occupying the foreground and middle ground. A mountain coastline stretches across the background, and the second person briefly appears in the middle ground on the right.",
