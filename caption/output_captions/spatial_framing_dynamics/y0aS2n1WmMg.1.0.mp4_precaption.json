    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, shot from a partially obscured viewpoint as if looking through a doorway, reveals a dimly lit bedroom. A man with dark hair tied back walks into the room, his body initially a dark silhouette. He is wearing a dark, long-sleeved shirt. He proceeds to the side of a bed with a wooden headboard and sits on the edge. The bed has a white pillow and rumpled sheets. Next to the bed, on a nightstand, sits a lamp with a white, pleated shade. The entire scene is cast in a very low, cool-toned light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a partially obscured viewpoint, a dark bedroom is seen at night, bathed in a dim, cool-toned light. In the center of the room, an unmade bed with a wooden, slatted headboard is visible, with white pillows and sheets. To the right of the bed, a small lamp with a white, pleated lampshade sits on a nightstand. A silhouetted figure enters the room, walks to the side of the bed, and sits down on the edge. The foreground is dominated by a dark, out-of-focus shape, framing the view as if looking through a narrow opening.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene is framed as a revealing shot through a narrow vertical opening, with large, dark, out-of-focus shapes occupying the foreground on the left and right. Initially, the view shows a bed in the middle ground, positioned in the center of the frame, with a nightstand and lamp to its right. A silhouetted figure then enters from the left, moving into the middle ground and walking towards the right, transitioning the view into a full shot. The figure comes to a stop and sits on the edge of the bed, now located in the center-right of the frame. The camera remains static and positioned at the subject's level throughout the action.",
