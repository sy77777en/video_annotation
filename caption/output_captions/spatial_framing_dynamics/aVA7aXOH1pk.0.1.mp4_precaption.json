    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white man with light-colored hair, the main subject of the video, stands on a stage wearing a dark suit and a white collared shirt. He initially spreads his hands open, then lowers them, and finally begins clapping to a large crowd. In front of the stage, a dense group of people, seen mostly from behind, hold up their smartphones to record the event, with many wearing red hats. Behind the man on stage, another large, cheering crowd holds up various signs, including blue and white ones that read \"TRUMP 2024\" and \"TRUMP,\" and white signs with red lettering that say \"YOU'RE FIRED!\". The stage is adorned with a red, white, and blue banner featuring white stars on a blue background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor daytime scene, a man in a dark suit stands on an elevated stage, waving to a large, dense crowd. The front of the stage is adorned with a red and white striped banner that includes a blue section with white stars. The enthusiastic crowd, many wearing red hats, holds up smartphones to record the event. Various signs are visible throughout the crowd, with some reading \"TRUMP 2024\" and \"YOU'RE FIRED.\" A text overlay is present in the bottom-left corner, stating, \"Donald Trump rushed off stage in Pennsylvania after gunshots ring out during rally (2024).\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, a man in a suit stands on a stage positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. A dense crowd, seen from behind, occupies the foreground and the bottom of the frame, holding up smartphones that create a layer in front of the stage. The stage itself extends horizontally across the middle ground. In the background, another large crowd fills the top portion of the frame, positioned behind the man on stage. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a fixed perspective on the scene.",
