    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a landscape scenery shot of a vast, snow-covered expanse under a clear twilight sky. In the middle ground, a white, multi-story building topped with a large, spherical radome stands alone, with a separate circular device visible nearby. A dark line of coniferous trees stretches across the horizon, separating the snowy field from the sky, which displays a striking gradient from dark blue at the top to purple and pink, then back to dark blue just above the treeline. The composition emphasizes the immense scale and serene, cold atmosphere of the remote environment, making the overall landscape the focus rather than any single object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A wide, snow-covered landscape is seen at twilight. In the center of the frame, a white, multi-story building is topped with a large, spherical dome. An external staircase is visible on the side of the building. The foreground is a vast, flat expanse of blue-tinted snow. In the background, a dark treeline sits below a clear sky that exhibits a gradient of colors, transitioning from deep blue at the top to purple and pink near the horizon, and then back to dark blue above the tree line. The scene is serene, with subtle changes occurring in the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static extreme wide shot of a landscape. A vast, snow-covered field occupies the foreground and the bottom half of the frame. In the middle ground, positioned in the horizontal center, is a building topped with a large spherical dome. A dark treeline stretches across the background, separating the snowy field from the sky, which fills the top half of the frame. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking straight across the flat terrain toward the horizon.",
