    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a first-person view from inside a car at night. The car's dark interior is illuminated by warm, orange light from the outside. Visible components include a dark-colored dashboard, on which sit a few small, light-colored, indistinct objects. The car's left A-pillar and the windshield are prominent in the view. At the top, the car's headliner has a sunroof and a roof console that features a small, round gauge glowing with a blue light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A scene captured from a camera positioned inside a moving vehicle at night shows the view ahead as it travels through a tunnel. The tunnel is illuminated by warm, yellow-orange lights, which reflect off the horizontally paneled walls, creating a sense of motion blur. Visible from inside the vehicle are the dark dashboard, the left A-pillar, a closed sunroof, and a side mirror reflecting the passing scenery. A small, circular gauge with a blue light is situated on the overhead console, and a few small, light-colored objects rest on the dashboard. A digital clock on the dashboard displays the time \"12 13\". Through the windshield, the tunnel stretches forward into the darkness, with distant lights visible at its end.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is positioned inside a car, providing a close-up shot of the scenery inside the car and a wide shot of scenery outside.",
    "pre_caption": "From an eye-level perspective inside a car, the shot provides a close-up of the interior in the foreground and a wide view of a tunnel outside. The car's dashboard occupies the bottom of the frame, with the left A-pillar running diagonally along the left edge. An overhead console is visible at the top center. The camera moves forward with the car, causing the tunnel walls in the middle ground, seen through the windshield and left window, to rush backward with significant motion blur. In the background, the distant end of the tunnel remains centered in the frame, appearing to grow closer as the car advances. Reflections from the tunnel's lights continuously sweep across the glass surfaces from right to left.",
