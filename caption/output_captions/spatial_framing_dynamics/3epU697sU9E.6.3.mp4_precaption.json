    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two white men in a professional setting. The initial focus is on an older, seated man with white hair, wearing a dark suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a patterned black and gray tie. He holds a pen and looks up attentively toward his upper right. A second, middle-aged man with short, graying hair and glasses is then revealed, standing and leaning slightly forward, facing the seated man on his left. This second man wears a light-colored pinstripe shirt, a red patterned tie, and a security badge on a lanyard around his neck. He is looking down and speaking to the seated man. As the camera moves, the profile of a Black woman enters from the bottom-left corner of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a formal indoor room with light-colored walls. Prominently displayed in the background is a large, circular wooden carving of the Great Seal of the United States, with the word \"STATES\" visible in an arc. A seated man in a dark suit and patterned tie holds a pen and looks up toward a standing man who leans in to speak. The standing man wears a pinstriped button-down shirt, a red patterned tie, and an ID badge on a lanyard. A black rectangular overlay with white text appears in the lower-left portion of the scene, accurately identifying \"JOSHUA BOLTEN.\" His title, \"WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF, 2001-2003,\" is presented with black text on a white rectangular background.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The scene begins on a close up shot of a man, before zooming out to a medium shot of a second man standing over his shoulder.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a close-up shot of a seated man positioned in the bottom-right middle ground, looking up toward the upper right. The camera then zooms out to a medium shot, revealing a second, standing man who occupies the left and center foreground, leaning over the seated man. In the background, a large, circular seal is visible in the upper right. As the standing man is fully revealed, a black rectangular text overlay appears in the lower-left portion of the frame. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
