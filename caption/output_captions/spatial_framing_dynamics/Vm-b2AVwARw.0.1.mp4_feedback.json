    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle, close-up shot looking down at the curved, star-patterned surface of a building, which fills the frame from top to bottom, with blurred architectural elements visible in the background. The camera moves downward along the surface before tilting upward, shifting the perspective to an extreme low-angle shot. In this final composition, the base of the building is centered at the bottom of the frame, and its facade tapers toward the top center, creating a sense of immense height against a dark background. Glowing blue lines frame the structure on the left and right. During the upward tilt, text appears in the upper left corner of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a high-angle shot. As the camera descends and tilts upward, it transitions to a low-angle perspective of a tall, futuristic building. The structure has a dark, curved facade that tapers toward the top. Its surface is covered in a dense, repeating pattern of small, illuminated white three-pointed stars, which are the logo for Mercedes-Benz. The vertical edges of the building are sharply defined by a glowing blue light, creating a strong visual contrast. During the tilt upward, white text reading \"Estimated Cost: 1,000,000,000$\" appears in the upper left corner, and additional white text \"[2]\" appears in the lower left corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a futuristic, blue-lit indoor environment, the perspective moves downward along a dark, curved surface. This surface is covered in a repeating pattern of small, illuminated, white, three-pointed stars. The edges of the curved structure are framed by glowing blue light strips, creating a tunnel-like effect. At the beginning of the video, the background consists of blurred architectural structures, which gradually transition to complete darkness as the camera tilts upward. An overlay appears in the upper left corner, displaying the text \"Estimated Cost: 1,000,000,000$\" in white. In the lower left corner, the white text \"[2]\" gradually appears.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a tall building, first moving down to capture its lower half, then tilting up to capture its upper half.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
