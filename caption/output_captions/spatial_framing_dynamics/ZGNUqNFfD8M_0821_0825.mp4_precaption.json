    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a close-up, in-focus shot of a young man with fair skin and short, dark hair, viewed in profile from the right. He is wearing a light blue collared shirt under a dark jacket. As the camera shifts focus away from the man, rendering him blurry, both the midground and background become sharply focused. In the midground, a woman stands in a doorway on the left, depicted as a dark silhouette in a dimly lit setting, wearing dark clothing. In the background on the right, another woman is visible in a dimly lit alley, also portrayed as a dark silhouette in dark attire.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor urban scene unfolds at night, characterized by dark, cool-toned lighting. In the foreground, a man is seen in profile against some dark foliage. The camera's focus transitions from the man to the midground and background, enhancing the depth of the scene and revealing a narrow alley between buildings. In the distance, another figure is visible at the top of some steps, and a lit window can be seen on an adjacent building. A sign with the word \"SLOW\" is partially visible in the alley. The video includes overlay elements: in the bottom left corner, a purple box contains a purple humanoid figure with the white text \"RACK FOCUS\" positioned to its right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a close-up of a man in the left foreground, who is in sharp focus against a blurry background. A rack focus then shifts the plane of focus from the foreground to the background. As the man becomes blurry, a woman in a doorway comes into focus in the left midground, and another woman standing at the top of steps becomes sharp in the right background. The camera remains at a level height with the subjects throughout this transition.",
