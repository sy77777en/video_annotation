    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a massive, dark alien spaceship with a complex, biomechanical structure, appearing as a chaotic assembly of dark gray and black, sharp-edged plates. On its dark underside, several circular engines emit a bright orange glow. This colossal vessel is surrounded by numerous smaller, gray fighter jets, which are flying in formation around it. In the foreground, two fighter jets enter from the bottom right of the frame, quickly moving to the midground on the upper left. These jets, dwarfed by the spaceship's scale, have the typical design of modern military aircraft, with their engines glowing a fiery orange as they fly close to the larger ship.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **High in the atmosphere, a massive, dark, and complex metallic structure with glowing orange circular lights on its underside flies through the sky, positioned between a bright, sunlit cloud layer below and a dark, heavy expanse of clouds above. Numerous gray fighter jets, some with their orange afterburners ignited, fly through the air around the large structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is above the main subject\u2014a spaceship\u2014but at the same height as some other aircraft and lower than others.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot frames a massive alien spaceship in the middle ground, positioned centrally and extending toward the right side of the frame. The vessel is situated between a bright cloud layer in the background below and a dark cloud ceiling occupying the top of the frame. Numerous smaller fighter jets are positioned in the middle ground and background, flying around the main ship. A prominent fighter jet enters from the bottom of the frame into the foreground and moves quickly toward the center-left, its glowing engine facing the camera, before receding into the middle ground. The camera is positioned at a high angle relative to the main spaceship but at a similar height to some of the jets, tracking alongside the formation as it moves forward.",
