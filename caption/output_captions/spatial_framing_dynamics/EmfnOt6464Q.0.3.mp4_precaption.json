    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a park scenery shot capturing a tranquil autumn day, viewed through the dark, ornate silhouette of a structure like a bridge or gazebo. The framing creates a window onto a landscape filled with trees displaying vibrant orange and yellow foliage under a warm, soft light. The ground is carpeted with fallen leaves, and in the background, the faint outlines of city buildings peek through the treeline, while a few distant figures stroll leisurely through the park. There is no single main subject; the video's focus is on the overall picturesque atmosphere, the rich seasonal colors, and the layered composition of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is viewed from behind the dark, silhouetted latticework of an ornate structure, looking out onto a city park during autumn. The foreground frame consists of a diamond-patterned railing over a row of decorative cutouts. Through this opening, the park is bathed in the warm, golden light of late afternoon, casting long shadows across rolling hills covered in grass and fallen leaves. Large, mature trees with orange and brown foliage dominate the landscape, with the faint outline of city buildings visible in the distance. A few small figures of people are seen walking through the park.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of a park, viewed from a level perspective through a framing structure. The entire foreground is occupied by the dark silhouette of an ornate structure, which creates a window-like view with its latticework at the top and decorative cutouts at the bottom. Through this frame, the middle ground reveals an autumn park scene with large trees positioned in the center, left, and right. A grassy hill slopes down from the right side of the scene. In the bottom left, two small figures and a dog walk from left to right. Another figure is visible walking in the center-right area of the middle ground. In the background, the faint outlines of city buildings can be seen behind the trees in the top left and top right portions of the view.",
