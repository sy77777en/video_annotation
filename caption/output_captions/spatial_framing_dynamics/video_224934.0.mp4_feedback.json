    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot, captured from a high-angle perspective, presents a vast landscape. Dark, heavy clouds occupy the top and middle portions of the frame. In the background, a mountain silhouette extends horizontally across the lower third of the scene. At the very bottom of the frame, city lights are visible in the foreground and middle ground. Initially, pink and red illuminated clouds are positioned in the center of the sky, just above the mountains, with a bright patch of light in the lower right. In this time-lapse, the pink and red colors in the central clouds quickly fade as the entire sky darkens, leaving the bright patch of light in the lower right as the remaining prominent light source.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot, specifically a time-lapse of a stormy sunset over a distant mountain range. The sky is filled with dark, heavy clouds, but breaks in the cloud cover reveal vibrant patches of pink and red, along with a large area of bright white light, illuminated by the setting sun. As the video progresses, these pink and red colors quickly fade, leaving the last vestiges of bright yellow and white light in the lower right portion of the frame. The focus is on the vast, changing atmosphere of the skyscape rather than a specific object, using the environmental shift to create a powerful and moody visual experience. The sheer scale of the cloud formations and the fading light are the central elements, emphasizing the natural spectacle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a time-lapse of a dramatic sunset over a mountain range. The outdoor scene is dominated by a sky filled with heavy, dark grey and black clouds that move across the view. As the sun sets, patches of clouds are briefly illuminated in shades of pink and red, with a bright spot of light visible near the horizon. These colors quickly fade as the sky darkens, leaving only the bright spot of light. Below, the dark silhouette of the mountains stretches across the horizon, and the faint lights of a city are visible from the foreground to the midground.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
