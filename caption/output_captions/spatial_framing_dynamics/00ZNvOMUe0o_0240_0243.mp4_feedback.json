    "pre_caption": "In this extreme wide shot, a red off-road vehicle is positioned in the bottom left of the frame, situated in the foreground on a dirt track. The track extends from the foreground through the vast, arid plain that occupies the middle ground, leading toward a mountain range in the background that spans the horizon. A partly cloudy sky fills the top portion of the frame. As the red vehicle drives forward along the track, the front corner of a dark-colored vehicle enters the scene from the bottom left corner, following the first vehicle in the foreground. The camera is positioned high above the subjects, maintaining a consistent aerial perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A red, two-door off-road vehicle with a white roof rack is seen from a rear three-quarter view, equipped with large, rugged tires. Initially, only the red vehicle is visible, but then a dark-colored vehicle enters the frame from the bottom left, showing only the partial outline of its front corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an expansive, arid plain covered in low, brown vegetation under a partly cloudy sky. A faint dirt track winds through the landscape, leading toward a distant range of dark mountains, some of which have snow on their peaks. In the lower-left portion of the scene, a red off-road vehicle with a roof rack drives along the track, followed closely by a dark vehicle entering the frame, with only its front visible as it advances along the track.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
