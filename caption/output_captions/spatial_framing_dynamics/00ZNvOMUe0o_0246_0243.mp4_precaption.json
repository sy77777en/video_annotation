    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an expansive landscape scenery shot capturing a breathtaking coastal view from a high vantage point. In the foreground, a dense, vibrant green forest canopy stretches out, covering rolling hills. Beyond the forest, a long, curving coastline with a sandy beach meets the calm, blue ocean, which extends to the horizon under a bright blue sky dotted with a few fluffy white clouds. There is no main subject in the video, as the composition is designed to emphasize the vast scale and serene beauty of the natural environment, focusing on the overall atmosphere rather than a specific entity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a high-angle, scenic view of a tropical coastline during the daytime. In the foreground, the lush green canopy of a dense forest covers rolling hills. Beyond the forest, a wide expanse of blue ocean meets the horizon under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. A sandy beach follows the curve of the land, which extends into the water to form a distinct point in the distance. Small white waves can be seen breaking along the shore.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape, captured from a high angle. A dense, green forest canopy occupies the foreground and middle ground, filling the bottom and right portions of the frame. In the background, the ocean and a curving coastline are positioned across the top half of the frame, with a blue sky and clouds at the very top. The camera slowly descends and moves slightly to the left. As it moves, the treetops in the right foreground rise, revealing more of the expansive forest in the center and left middle ground, while the background coastline remains visible beyond the trees.",
