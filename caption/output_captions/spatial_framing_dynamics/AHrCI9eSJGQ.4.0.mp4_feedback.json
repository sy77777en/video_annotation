    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot captured from a high-angle perspective, looking out from the stern of a container ship. In the foreground, stacks of shipping containers occupy the bottom half of the frame from the bottom left to the bottom right, forming a V-shape that leads into the scene. The middle ground is composed of the open sea, which stretches from the center of the frame toward the background. A small boat is positioned in the middle ground on the right, moving across the water. The background is dominated by the sky, which fills the top half of the frame above the central horizon line. Along the horizon in the background, several distant ships and a faint landmass are visible. A text overlay is located in the bottom right corner. The streaking clouds and the wake of the small boat indicate movement over time from a fixed camera position on the moving vessel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a seascape scenery shot filmed from the stern of a massive container ship. The focus is not on a single object but on the expansive environment and the atmosphere of a sea voyage. The composition emphasizes the scale of the ship against the vastness of the ocean and sky. Stacks of red, blue, and orange shipping containers fill the foreground, leading the eye towards the open, calm, greenish-blue sea under a vast, pale blue sky with wispy, streaked clouds, while a few other ships are visible as small silhouettes on the hazy horizon.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From the stern of a large container ship, the view looks out over stacks of multicolored shipping containers\u2014primarily red, blue, and orange\u2014towards the open sea. The vessel moves through calm, greenish-blue water under a vast, overcast sky with wispy, streaking clouds, suggesting a time-lapse. In the distance, a faint landmass is visible on the horizon, along with several other ships. A smaller boat is also seen moving across the water, creating a wake. An overlay in the lower right corner displays the text \"YouTube JEFFHK\" in white and red.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
