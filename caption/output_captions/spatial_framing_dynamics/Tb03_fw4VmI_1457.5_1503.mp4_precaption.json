    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a dramatic coastal or fjord environment from an immersive, water-level perspective. The view looks across dark, choppy waves towards a distant range of majestic, snow-covered mountains under a clear, deep blue twilight sky that fades to a pale glow at the horizon on the right side of the frame. The lens is momentarily covered by seawater before submerging, which then reveals the dark, teal-colored depths. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the vast, cold atmosphere of the natural setting. The focus is placed on the scale of the environment and the feeling of being present within it, rather than on any single object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a perspective at the surface of dark, choppy water, the scene captures a view of distant, snow-covered mountains under a clear sky during dawn or dusk. The sky transitions from a deep blue to a lighter shade, culminating in a faint glow at the horizon on the right side of the frame. The camera, influenced by the waves, bobs up and down, briefly submerging into the seawater before descending to the bottom. This reveals a dark, teal underwater scene with small bubbles visible. The movement creates a split perspective, providing a brief alternating view between the mountainous landscape above and the underwater depths below.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle, water-level perspective. Initially, dark, choppy water occupies the foreground in the bottom half of the frame. A range of snow-covered mountains extends across the middle ground in the center, with a clear sky filling the background in the top half of the frame. The camera then submerges, transitioning the view to an underwater scene where the water's surface is visible at the top of the frame. The camera continues to bob, creating a split perspective that briefly alternates between the underwater view and the above-water landscape.",
