    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with light skin and dark hair, wearing a dark blue blazer over a white button-down shirt, light-colored pants, and dark sunglasses, is the central figure walking forward. He is surrounded by an entourage of several other men, most of whom are dressed in black t-shirts. The man with short dark hair and a muscular build is positioned in front of him to his right, while the man with short brown hair is slightly behind him to his right. Additionally, a bald man in dark clothing is positioned behind him to his left. In the background, a man in a black outfit is standing on an outdoor staircase, and a man in a grey t-shirt and sunglasses is in the midground near a white tent where other individuals are seated.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place outdoors during the day in a paved area next to a white, two-story building. An external white staircase with a metal railing, which has a small Turkish flag attached at the top, runs up the side of the building. To the right, a large white event tent is set up, sheltering white round tables and matching chairs. A group of people walks through the space, with a central figure wearing a blue blazer and sunglasses. Other individuals are visible in the background, some standing on the staircase and others seated at the tables. A small, black square overlay containing the text \"[2]\" is present in the bottom-left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a man in a blue blazer occupies the center of the frame, walking forward. He is surrounded by an entourage, with a man in a black t-shirt positioned in the left foreground and other men in the middle ground to his left and right. The entire group moves toward the camera, which tracks backward to maintain the framing. In the middle ground on the right, a man in a grey t-shirt stands near a large white tent where people are seated at tables. The background features a white building with an external staircase on the left, where another individual is standing. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level. A small, static overlay is visible in the bottom-left corner.",
