    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video first reveals a man, seen from behind as a dark silhouette, wearing a long coat and walking away from the camera. As he moves forward, two more figures appear behind him. One individual is wearing a dark, long overcoat and is pushing another person who is in a wheelchair. The last person is positioned closely behind them and is nearest to the camera, holding a small, dark dog on her left shoulder. All three people are presented as silhouettes moving towards the light at the end of the alley.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dark, narrow alleyway framed by a stone arch. The unpaved ground is a dirt path littered with paper and other debris. The dark, grimy walls of the alley lead towards a brighter, foggy opening at the far end, where the faint outline of a building with windows is visible. The entire scene is cast in a desaturated, greenish-blue light. Several silhouetted figures, including one person pushing a wheelchair and another carrying a dog on their shoulder, move away from the camera down the path and into the fog.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera shows a wide shot of an empty alley initially, then reveals three people one by one into the scene with a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject, and the camera height remains unchanged.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a dark, narrow alley, framed by an arch in the foreground that creates a tunnel effect. The dirt path runs down the center of the frame from the foreground to the background, with debris scattered along the bottom left and bottom right. A silhouetted man enters the frame from the foreground, positioned in the center, and walks away from the camera into the middle ground. As the shot transitions to a full shot, two more silhouetted figures\u2014one pushing a wheelchair and another carrying a dog\u2014emerge from the foreground, following the first man down the central path. The group moves together through the middle ground, receding towards the bright, foggy opening that occupies the center of the background.",
