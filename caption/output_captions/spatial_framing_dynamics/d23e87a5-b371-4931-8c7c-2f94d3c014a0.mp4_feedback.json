    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a man is initially seen from behind, positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of a long, narrow hallway. The hallway's walls, lined with doors and pictures, occupy the left and right sides of the frame, receding from the foreground into the background to create significant depth. As the man walks away from the camera toward the background, he turns his upper body and head to his left, looking back toward the camera while remaining in the center of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with short, dark hair is seen from behind, wearing a black hooded sweatshirt. He turns his head and upper body to look back over his shoulder, revealing a facial expression with wide eyes and a slightly open mouth.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot framing the character from the hip up follows a young man in a dark sweatshirt walking down a long, dimly lit indoor hallway. The narrow corridor features light-colored walls with white trim and is lined with closed white doors. Dark-framed pictures hang on the walls between the doorways, and a patterned carpet covers the floor. The hallway is illuminated by a series of rectangular ceiling fixtures, with the corridor receding into darkness at the far end. During his walk, the man turns his head to look back over his shoulder.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
