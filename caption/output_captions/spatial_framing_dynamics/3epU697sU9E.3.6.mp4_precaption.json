    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated, high-angle, top-down view shows a large, four-engine passenger jet on an airfield. The aircraft, which resembles a Boeing 747, is painted white on its top half and light blue on its bottom half, separated by a dark blue stripe. The words \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" are printed in blue capital letters along the side of the fuselage. The tail features a United States flag, while the letters \"USAF\" are located on the right wing. The plane is positioned at an intersection of taxiways, which are marked with yellow lines on the brown-gray tarmac. A large, dark shadow of the aircraft is cast onto the ground beneath it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a high-angle view of a large, four-engine airplane on an airport tarmac. The aircraft, painted white and blue with \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" on its fuselage and an American flag on its tail, is positioned at an intersection of yellow taxiway lines. The flat, brownish-gray surface of the tarmac is illuminated by a low sun, which casts a long, distinct shadow of the plane. The camera moves forward while tilting down, then arcs clockwise toward the airplane while tilting up slightly, capturing the aircraft as it turns to its right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "A wide, high-angle shot shows a large, four-engine airplane from above. The aircraft is positioned in the center of the frame, located in the middle ground at an intersection of taxiways on a brown tarmac. Yellow lines marking the taxiways extend from the center toward the edges of the frame. A large shadow of the plane is cast on the tarmac beneath it, slightly offset to the bottom right. The entire scene remains static throughout the shot.",
