In the middle ground, a yellow robotic arm is positioned in the center-left within a circular enclosure. Further back and to the left, another robotic arm in the upper-left corner emits sparks from welding. A group of people in hard hats is gathered on a platform in the center-right middle ground, while another person sits on a concrete wall in the bottom-right.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In an industrial setting, several individuals are gathered on an elevated platform, wearing a mix of light gray jumpsuits, light-colored shirts, white lab coats, and dark-colored attire, with most donning white hard hats. Two large, yellow, articulated robotic arms are at work. One robotic arm, positioned in the center-left, moves in front of the stainless steel tanks and equipment as if it has just finished manipulating them within a circular, white-padded enclosure. A second robotic arm, located on the upper left, emits sparks as if welding. In the background, other men in dark work attire are present, while in the bottom right middleground, a man in a dark shirt, dark-grey pants, and a hard hat sits outside on a concrete wall, and another man stands next to him. Numerous out-of-focus white rectangular papers appear to be falling or flying in the foreground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in an industrial facility featuring concrete walls and columns, along with large yellowish-brown metal structures. In the center-left, a yellow robotic arm is positioned inside a circular enclosure lined with padded, light-colored material, with black and yellow caution tape lining its opening. Several people in mostly gray uniforms and white hard hats are gathered in the midground near control panels and equipment, while some are also visible in the distant background and others stand or sit along the perimeter. Sheets of white paper are seen fluttering through the air, adding a sense of movement to the environment. The lighting is bright and even, illuminating the machinery and the people present. No overlays or digital elements are visible within the scene.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
