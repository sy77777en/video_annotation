    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a high-angle, over-the-shoulder close-up, where the back of a person's head and shoulders occupy the bottom-left foreground, leaving the background blurred. The focus then racks from the person to the middle ground, bringing a wooden desk into sharp view while the person's shoulder remains as an out-of-focus element in the bottom-left foreground. On the desk in the middle ground, a stack of two hard drives is positioned on the left, with a single hard drive to its right. A telephone and papers are visible further back in the middle ground, toward the left side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with an over-the-shoulder view of a person with short, black hair and pale, smooth skin, wearing a black, textured shirt. The focus then shifts to a wooden desk in front of them, revealing three external hard drives in clear, transparent rectangular cases. Two of these cases are stacked on the left, while a single one sits on the right. The top surface of the cases has a grated texture, and the internal components, including a circular platter, are visible through the plastic. Each transparent rectangular casing has a circular white logo on its side. In the midground on the desk, a grey landline telephone and some white papers are also visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins by focusing on the back of a person with short black hair in the foreground. As the camera moves, the focus transitions to a wooden office desk in the midground. On the desk are several electronic devices encased in clear, translucent plastic with a gridded texture on top; some are stacked. A grey landline telephone and white papers are also visible on the desk. White text subtitles on a black background are located in the lower-left corner of the frame, displaying the text \"[10]\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera first focuses on the back of the person, which is considered a close up shot, and then focuses on the objects on the table in the background.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
