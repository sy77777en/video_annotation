    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a wide, static cityscape scenery shot depicting a panoramic view of London along the River Thames. The scene is framed by two iconic modern skyscrapers: the tall, pointed Shard on the far left and the distinctively curved \"Walkie-Talkie\" building (20 Fenchurch Street) on the right. The wide, brown river flows through the center, with a historic warship, HMS Belfast, moored near a bridge in the mid-ground. The entire vista is bathed in the warm, hazy glow of a low sun, casting a golden hue over the water and the mix of glass-fronted and traditional buildings lining the banks. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to capture the expansive scale and atmosphere of the urban environment, emphasizing the grandeur of the location rather than any specific object or action within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The London skyline is captured along the River Thames on a hazy day with a warm, golden-toned sky. The wide, brown river flows through the center of the scene, its surface appearing smooth. On the left bank, the tall, pointed glass skyscraper, The Shard, stands next to modern, green-tinted glass buildings. On the right bank, the distinctive curved shape of the \"Walkie-Talkie\" building is prominent among a mix of architecture. A historic warship is moored in the middle of the river, with a bridge visible in the background. A small white logo overlay is positioned in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide, static scenery shot captured from a high-angle, elevated perspective. The River Thames flows horizontally across the lower half of the frame, occupying the foreground and extending into the middle ground. The composition is framed by two prominent skyscrapers in the background: The Shard is positioned on the far left, and the \"Walkie-Talkie\" building is on the right. In the middle ground, a warship is moored centrally within the river, just in front of a bridge that spans the water further in the background. A small white logo is statically positioned in the bottom right corner of the frame.",
