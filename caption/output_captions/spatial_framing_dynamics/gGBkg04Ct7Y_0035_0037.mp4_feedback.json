    "pre_caption": "In a static close-up shot, a woman is centered in the frame from the chest up, occupying the middle ground. She is seated in a high-backed chair, which is also centered in the middle ground. In the background, two vertical light tubes are positioned symmetrically behind her, with a textured wall visible in the far background. A text overlay is located at the bottom of the frame in the foreground. The camera is positioned at the woman's eye level, and while she moves her head slightly, her central position within the frame remains constant.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with brown skin and a black, shoulder-length bob with straight bangs is shown sitting in a high-backed chair. She wears a sheer, black, long-sleeved top with a white-outlined, black circular patch on her left chest. Around her neck is a thick, silver metal chain choker. Her facial expression changes as she sings or speaks, with her mouth open at one point and her lips pressed together in another, shifting from a slight smile to a more intense look.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors within a dimly lit, hazy room cast in a greenish-yellow light. A woman with a black bob haircut is seated in a high-backed chair with a dark frame. Positioned behind the chair are two tall, vertical, white light tubes that illuminate the smoky atmosphere against a plain, textured wall. An overlay at the bottom of the screen features a black bar with white text, which reads \"CARDI B - BODAK YELLOW\" on the top line and \"DIRECTED BY PICTURE PERFECT\" on the bottom line.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
