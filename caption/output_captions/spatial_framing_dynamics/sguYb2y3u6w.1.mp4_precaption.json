    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A green, cartoon crocodile is depicted from the chest up, sitting in the driver's seat of a vehicle. The crocodile wears a small, white nurse's cap that has a red cross on the front. The vehicle is a white ambulance with a red horizontal stripe running along its side and a red cross symbol on a white square panel. On the roof of the ambulance is a small light bar with one red and one blue light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a 2D cartoon animation, a white ambulance with a red horizontal stripe and a red cross on its side drives from left to right. The vehicle, which has a red and blue siren on its roof, is driven by a green alligator wearing a small white cap with a red cross. The ambulance travels along a grey paved road. The background features a stylized, daytime landscape of rolling hills in shades of light green, dark green, and teal, with simple tree shapes under a pale sky. The camera moves to the right, tracking the ambulance to keep it centered in the frame while gradually zooming out.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins as a full shot with a cartoon ambulance, driven by a crocodile, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. A grey road occupies the bottom of the frame, also in the middle ground, while a stylized landscape of green hills and trees fills the upper portion of the frame in the background. As the ambulance moves from left to right, the camera pans to track its movement, keeping the vehicle centered. Concurrently, the camera zooms out, transitioning the framing to a wide shot where the ambulance appears smaller within the scene. The camera maintains a level height relative to the ambulance throughout the shot.",
