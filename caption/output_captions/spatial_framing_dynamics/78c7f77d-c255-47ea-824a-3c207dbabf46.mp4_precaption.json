    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned woman is seen from behind as she moves through a dark, narrow space with intermittent cool-toned lighting. She has short dark hair and is wearing a dark, sleeveless top or dress with thin straps. A small, dark tattoo is visible in the center of her upper back, just below her neck. Her face is not shown.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, the scene progresses through a narrow outdoor alley at night. The confined space is flanked by building walls, one of which has a doorway with posters and a lit sign, while the other features a plain, light-colored surface beside a doorway with a mounted rectangular object resembling an air conditioning unit. The entire scene is cast in a cool, blue-green light. A dense web of electrical wires crisscrosses overhead, and various small, illuminated signs and street lamps are visible further down the passage. The camera follows the character, who has dark hair and is wearing a dark top, as they move forward through the alley.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In this medium shot, a woman is positioned in the center foreground, viewed from behind. She is framed by the walls of a narrow alley that occupy the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the background. A lit doorway is visible in the left middle ground, while overhead wires and distant lights are situated at the top of the frame. The camera, positioned at the woman's level, follows her as she moves forward down the center of the alley, maintaining a consistent distance from her back as she progresses deeper into the scene.",
