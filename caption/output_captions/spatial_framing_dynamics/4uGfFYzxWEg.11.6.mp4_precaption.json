    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two stylized, human-like figures stand in the foreground, their backs to the viewer, looking at a large stack of money. The figures are rendered in a dark, low-polygon style, giving them a faceted, crystalline appearance with white, red, and gray highlights on their edges. Between them, positioned centrally, is a large, rectangular block composed of neat stacks of what appears to be paper currency, resting on a red pallet. In the lower-left corner of the scene, white text reads, \"25% of the winnings went to Keith Burgess & Paddy Spooner.\" A white text label \"[19]\" is also present in the bottom left corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, indoor space with a prominent red and black color scheme. A red path extends down the center of the floor, leading to a pallet heavily stacked with bundles of cash. On either side of this path, two silhouetted, low-polygon figures stand facing the money. The surrounding area is furnished with red office desks and chairs. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays white text that reads, \"25% of the winnings went to Keith Burgess & Paddy Spooner,\" along with a white text label \"[19].\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This static medium shot is framed from a high angle, looking down upon the scene. In the foreground, two stylized figures are positioned at the bottom left and bottom right of the frame, their backs facing the viewer. A red path runs from the bottom center of the frame through the middle ground and into the background. Situated centrally in the middle ground, on top of this path, is a large stack of money on a pallet. Red office desks and chairs occupy the middle ground and background on both the left and right sides of the central path. White text is overlaid in the bottom left corner of the frame.",
