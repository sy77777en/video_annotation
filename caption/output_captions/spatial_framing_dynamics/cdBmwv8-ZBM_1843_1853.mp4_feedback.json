    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium-full shot of a man positioned in the left foreground, viewed from a camera angle slightly above and behind him. As he moves toward the center, the camera follows, maintaining its position as he starts to descend a staircase that occupies the right side of the frame. During his descent, the camera pans left, briefly showing figures in the background through a window on the left before recentering on the man as he moves from the upper middle ground to the lower middle ground. Upon reaching the bottom floor, the camera's height adjusts to the subject's level. The man then walks forward from the center of the frame into the background, moving past a table in the left middle ground and a barrel in the right middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a third-person perspective, a person with short blond hair is seen from behind, walking through a dimly lit interior. They are wearing a dark brown leather jacket with a light-colored shearling collar, a dark shirt, and dark pants, with a gun holster visible on their right thigh. As they descend a wooden staircase, the camera briefly pans across a window, revealing several figures gathered closely together. These appear to be middle-aged adults dressed in simple, worn clothing, including a woman wearing a light-colored headscarf. They are carrying tools that resemble shovels. The person in the jacket then continues walking on the lower floor and eventually shoots a bald man who is holding a shovel with a long stick.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot, framing a character from the hip up, follows them as they move through a dimly lit, rustic house. The interior features rough stone and plaster walls, wooden plank floors on the upper level, and red tiled floors below. The scene is illuminated by candlelight placed in several areas, including multiple hanging chandeliers and wall sconces, along with the faint, gloomy light filtering through windows, including a small, multi-paned one. The character descends a wooden staircase with a carved banister into a lower room. Beneath the staircase, there is a dimly lit space where the candlelight from the ceiling casts a dark red hue. This area is cluttered with wooden furniture, including a table and several chairs, which illuminate a small section of the surrounding stone walls and floor tiles. A white subtitle overlay at the very beginning of the video reads, \"Oh, nice,\" and disappears quickly.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a third-person perspective game video. The camera follows the character from behind, showing him in a medium-full shot while leaving more space for a wide shot of the scene. At the end, as the camera zooms in, it shifts to a close-up of the character while he shoots another fully visible person.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
