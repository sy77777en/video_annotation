    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a woman with long, dark, curly hair entering the frame in profile. She turns her head, providing a view from behind before exiting the frame. The scene then shifts to a large crowd of humanoid figures running across a vast desert. The figures, appearing as light-colored and dark-colored silhouettes, clash and interweave as two opposing factions charging at each other, casting long shadows on the sand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a profile shot of a woman with long, dark hair. As the camera tilts downward, the perspective shifts to an over-the-shoulder view, revealing a vast desert landscape under a bright, clear sky. The scene is dominated by immense, rolling sand dunes that stretch to the horizon, their surfaces a mix of golden-brown sand and dark shadows. Gradually, the woman is no longer in the frame, unveiling a large group of human figures appearing in the desert expanse below. These figures represent two opposing factions, advancing from the left and right sides of the frame toward the center, where they converge and clash, kicking up dust and casting long shadows in the daytime sun.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera first captures a close-up of the woman\u2019s profile, then moves forward and tilts downward, revealing a crowd in the distance in an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a woman in profile, positioned in the foreground on the right side of the frame, with a vast desert landscape visible in the background. The camera then moves forward and tilts downward, transitioning from a shot at the woman's level to a high-angle, extreme wide shot. As the camera moves, the woman exits the right side of the frame, revealing a large crowd of figures emerging in the middle ground, occupying the lower half of the frame. These figures run from the bottom left and bottom right, converging towards the center of the frame, while the expansive desert dunes remain in the background.",
