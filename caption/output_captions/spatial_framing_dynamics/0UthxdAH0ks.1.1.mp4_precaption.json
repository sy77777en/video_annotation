    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subjects are a group of about ten young men, appearing to be of East Asian descent, lined up and performing a synchronized stretching routine. They are dressed in athletic attire, with some being shirtless and others wearing tank tops or t-shirts in colors like grey, white, and light blue, paired with dark shorts and white sneakers. One man in the line is distinguished by his bright red hair, while the others have short, dark hair. In the background, a middle-aged man, also of East Asian descent, stands observing them. He acts as an instructor or coach, wearing a green and white tracksuit jacket over dark pants with a whistle on a lanyard around his neck, and he shouts out numbers to count the repetitions of the exercise.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors during the daytime on a paved surface in front of a large, empty stadium. The background is dominated by rows of weathered, grey concrete bleachers that form a tiered, imposing structure. A line of young men in athletic attire is arranged on the paved ground. To the right, a man in a green and white tracksuit stands and observes. The group of men moves in unison, performing a series of stretching movements. One of the men in the line has bright red hair. The lighting is bright, and the overall color scheme is desaturated.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a group of young men is arranged in a diagonal line that extends from the bottom left foreground toward the center middle ground, with an instructor standing in the right middle ground. The background is filled with the tiered concrete bleachers of a stadium. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level. The men, initially in a bent-over standing position, move in unison, lowering themselves into a low lunge position with their hands on the ground. They then perform a synchronized twisting stretch, raising one arm toward the sky before returning to the lunge position. The camera and the instructor remain stationary throughout the sequence.",
