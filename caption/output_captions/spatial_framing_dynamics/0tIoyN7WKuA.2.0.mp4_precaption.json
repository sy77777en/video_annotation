    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two owls in flight. One is a large, predominantly white owl with black speckles on its wings, wearing a silver and gold metallic helmet that covers its forehead. The other is a smaller owl with brown and tan feathers on its back and wings and a lighter-colored underside, resembling a barn owl. The larger, helmeted owl is flying from the left toward the right side of the frame, while the smaller, brown owl on the right is flying leftward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A turbulent, dark teal sea is churned into white-capped waves during a heavy snowstorm. A bright, hazy light emanates from the upper left, illuminating the falling snow and water spray, creating a chaotic and misty scene. Two large, winged creatures fly low over the tumultuous water. One is primarily white with dark markings and wears a silver and golden metallic helmet, while the other is brown with lighter-colored wing feathers.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot captures two owls flying over a turbulent sea. Initially, a large white owl is in the middle ground on the left, and a smaller brown owl is in the middle ground on the right. The white owl flies from left to right while the brown owl flies from right to left, causing them to converge near the center of the frame. Both owls remain in the middle ground throughout their movement. The sea serves as the background, with falling snow visible in the foreground, middle ground, and background, adding depth to the scene. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
