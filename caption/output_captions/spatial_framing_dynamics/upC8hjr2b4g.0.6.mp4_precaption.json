    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two men with obscured faces are shown in a dimly lit interior. The man on the left, seen in profile, wears a light blue, long-sleeved, collared shirt and has short, black hair. Standing slightly behind him and to the right is another man, also in profile, wearing a black, short-sleeved t-shirt and with short, black hair. Both men are looking towards the left, and their faces are rendered as smooth, featureless surfaces, making their expressions and identities indiscernible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This is an animated indoor scene set in a dimly lit hallway with warm, neutral-colored walls. On the left, a doorway with a white frame is visible, and a white rectangular object, identified as a switch, is mounted on the wall beside it. Two male figures with obscured faces stand in the hallway. The figure in the foreground wears a light blue collared shirt, while the one behind him is in a black t-shirt. Both are looking towards the doorway. An overlay of yellow subtitles appears at the bottom of the screen, displaying dialogue such as, \"They claimed they are police,\" \"They're saying: 'Okay, do you know this person?',\" \"...which is a name I never heard of,\" and \"They said he's in trouble. He got picked up yesterday.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static medium close-up shot, a man in a light blue shirt is positioned in the left foreground, while a second man in a black t-shirt stands slightly behind him in the right middle ground. Both are shown in profile, looking towards a doorway that occupies the far left of the frame in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, and the spatial composition remains fixed throughout the scene.",
