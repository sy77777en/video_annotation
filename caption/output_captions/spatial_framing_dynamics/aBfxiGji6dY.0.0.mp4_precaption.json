    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a video call between two women. The main screen shows a light-skinned woman with long, wavy, reddish-blonde hair, identified as \"Kate.\" She is lying in bed, propped up on pillows and covered by a white duvet, wearing a grey knit cardigan over a white shirt. Her face is contorted as she cries. In a smaller window in the bottom right corner, a dark-skinned woman with short black hair is seen. She is wearing a yellow, short-sleeved top with a dotted pattern and has a concerned expression on her face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a software or system interface shows a video call in progress. The main, larger portion of the screen displays a top-down view of a woman with reddish-blonde hair lying in a bed. She is propped up on white pillows, wearing a gray, textured cardigan over a white shirt, and is partially covered by a white comforter. In the bottom right corner, a smaller, picture-in-picture window shows another woman with short, dark hair in a yellow, patterned shirt, against a light blue wall. Initially, stairs are visible behind her, although they later move out of the frame. Overlaying the video call interface are several elements: at the top, the name \"Kate\" is displayed in white text next to a small pink heart icon. At the bottom, there is a white camera icon within a solid grey circle on the left and a white 'X' icon within a solid red circle in the center.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene is presented as a video call interface. The main video feed, occupying the majority of the central frame, displays a woman from the chest up in a high-angle, top-down shot as she lies in bed, positioned in the foreground of her immediate environment. In the bottom right corner, a smaller, picture-in-picture window contains a straight-on, chest-up view of a second woman, who is in the foreground relative to the wall behind her. Overlaid in the absolute foreground of the entire screen are several interface elements: the name \"Kate\" is at the top center, a camera icon is at the bottom left, and an 'X' icon is at the bottom center. The subjects remain static in their respective positions within the frame.",
