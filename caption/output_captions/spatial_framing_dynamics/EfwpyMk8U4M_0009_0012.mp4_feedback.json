    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium close-up of a boy, whose upper body is centered in the bottom half of the frame. In the background, trees and houses are situated in the middle ground, with the sky and power lines occupying the top of the frame. The camera, positioned at the boy's level, then performs a downward tilt. As it moves, the boy's upper body exits the top of the frame, and the shot reframes into a medium shot, showing his lower body from the waist down in the center. This reveals the paved street in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A white text overlay is consistently positioned in the foreground at the very bottom of the screen throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young boy with light skin and short, dark hair is shown standing and stretching his arms. He wears a dark blue t-shirt with a yellow sun-like graphic and the word \"Shine\" on the front, paired with red shorts that have a small cartoon character patch on the left leg. Initially, the view is focused on his upper body and head as he holds one arm across his chest with the other. After the perspective shifts to reveal his lower body, the camera angle changes, leaving only his lower body in a standing posture visible in the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a paved residential street on a bright, sunny day. In the background, houses with tiled roofs are visible behind lush green trees, all under a clear blue sky crisscrossed by numerous power lines. A low, decorative concrete wall runs along the side of the street. The camera performs a downward tilt, gradually shifting the view from the upper body of a person standing in the road to a composition that includes the paved surface and the lower body of the person. An overlay, a white rectangular box with black text, is positioned at the bottom, stating: \"Tilt is a cinematographic technique in which the camera stays in a fixed position but rotates up/down.\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera starts with a standing boy with only his arms and head visible at the bottom, then the camera tilts down, eventually showing his lower body and becoming a medium shot.\n\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
