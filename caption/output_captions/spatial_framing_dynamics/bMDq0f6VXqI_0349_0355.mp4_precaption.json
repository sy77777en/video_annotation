    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A digital illustration of a mountain landscape is shown being deconstructed into its component layers. The complete scene depicts a valley filled with dark green pine trees, flanked by a large, rocky, tan and brown mountain under a light blue sky with white clouds. A brown wooden utility pole with crossbars stands among the trees. The illustration is then rotated horizontally, revealing its 3D layer structure, with the foreground trees, midground utility poles, and the combined forest and mountains in the background. Some individual pine trees are shown isolated on a transparent background before the layers rotate back together to form the composite view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a software interface shows a digital animation project in Adobe After Effects. The main window displays a stylized landscape painting of a forested valley with a large, tan-colored mountain on the right side against a light blue sky. The scene is composed of multiple layers, including green evergreen trees in the foreground and midground, a wooden telephone pole, and the background mountain and forest. The view within the software initially pans to the right, then shifts to the left, and finally returns to panning to the right again, revealing the 3D separation of these layers, with a transparent checkerboard pattern visible in the gaps between them. The software's user interface, including a timeline with labeled layers at the bottom and various tool panels, frames the central artwork.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video shows a digital landscape illustration, initially presented from a frontal, level perspective and centered in the frame. The scene is composed of multiple layers arranged in 3D space: dark green pine trees occupy the foreground across the bottom of the image, a wooden utility pole and more trees are in the middle ground, and a large mountain on the right with a forested valley on the left forms the background. The view then rotates horizontally, first panning to the right to reveal the spatial separation between the foreground, middle ground, and background layers. It then pans back to the left, moving past the initial frontal view to show the layered depth from the opposite side, before panning right again. This continuous rotation deconstructs and reconstructs the composite image, demonstrating the depth between the elements which are positioned progressively further from the camera.",
