    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a serene nature scene within a tranquil wooded area. The camera is positioned among several tree trunks, initially focusing on the trees in the midground. The focal plane then shifts to a tree in the midground that is closer to the camera, before finally focusing on a tree in the left foreground. The \"f/3.5\" text on screen indicates the use of a shallow depth of field, emphasizing the visual interplay between different planes of the environment and enhancing the peaceful atmosphere without highlighting a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene in a wooded area features several trees with rough, textured bark. The ground is covered in brown pine needles and patches of green grass under soft, natural daylight. In the background, a line of trees stands before a brighter, open space. The camera's focus shifts during the shot, moving from the distant trees to a closer trunk, briefly losing focus before settling on a tree in the left foreground. An overlay of white text reading \"f/3.5\" is positioned at the bottom center of the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a close-up shot.",
    "pre_caption": "This scenery video begins as a wide shot of a wooded area, framed by two out-of-focus tree trunks in the left and right foreground. The initial focus is on a row of trees in the middle ground, positioned across the center of the frame, with an open space visible in the background. The ground is visible at the bottom, and the text \"f/3.5\" is overlaid at the bottom center. The camera's focus then shifts forward, briefly sharpening a tree in the right middle ground before settling on the tree trunk in the left foreground. This transition changes the shot to a close-up on the bark of the foreground tree, rendering the middle ground and background completely out of focus. The camera remains stationary at a medium height throughout the shot.",
