    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A muscular, humanoid creature with a light skin tone is the main subject, shown climbing along a thick, dark metal chain. The creature is in a crouched position, using its hands and feet to traverse the chain. It wears minimal dark clothing with gold-colored trim around its waist and torso. A bow and arrow are slung over its back, and a quiver is hanging at its waist. At the beginning of the video, the head of a giant white-furred creature appears on the left side of the frame. At the conclusion of the video, another humanoid creature can be seen in the lower-right corner of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds within a vast, dark cavern illuminated by a murky green light. In the background, large, blocky structures resembling ancient ruins or ice formations are visible through a hazy atmosphere. A thick, dark metal chain extends from the lower-left corner of the foreground to the right side of the midground, providing a clear path for a figure traversing it. At the beginning, a large, furry object is partially visible on the left side of the frame. As the camera arcs, this furry object gradually moves out of the frame, enhancing the dynamic nature of the scene. Small, bright particles drift throughout the space, contributing to the underwater or dusty quality of the environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot opens with a large, white-furred creature occupying the foreground on the left, while the main subject, a humanoid creature, is positioned in the middle ground, slightly left of center. The main subject climbs along a chain that extends from the bottom-left foreground toward the right side of the frame. In the background, large, blocky structures are visible on the right. As the camera arcs to the right, the foreground creature moves out of the frame on the left, and the main subject travels along the chain from the center-left toward the right, remaining in the middle ground. The background structures shift with the camera's movement, moving from the right side toward the center of the frame. Throughout the shot, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
