    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot angled up at the white canopy of a gas station, which occupies the top of the frame. Two red gas pumps are in the foreground on the bottom left and bottom right, framing a view of mountains in the background at the bottom center. The camera then tilts down, transitioning to a wide shot at the subjects' level. As the camera settles, a red convertible enters from the right and stops in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. A white car is parked in the middle ground on the left, with a person standing beside it. The two foreground gas pumps remain on the bottom left and right, framing the entire scene, while the gas station building and mountains are visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a gas station scene as the camera tilts down from the white overhead canopy. A vintage-style, red, two-door convertible with the top down pulls into view, occupied by a driver with dark hair. In the midground, a person in a light pink, long-sleeved outfit stands beside a white vintage car parked at a gas pump. The scene is framed by two large, red and white gas pumps in the foreground, one marked with the number \"8\" and the other with the brand \"XLX GASOLINE.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at an outdoor gas station during the daytime, with a backdrop of large mountains under a clear sky. A white canopy extends over the area, supported by pillars. In the foreground, two red, white, and black gas pumps frame the view, featuring partially visible white text that reads \"SELF\" and \"XLX GASOLINE\" in a red and yellow gradient on a white background. A red convertible car drives into the station and stops at a pump, where a white car is also parked. A person in a pink outfit stands near one of the pumps. The scene is captured from a dynamic perspective.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a wide shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
