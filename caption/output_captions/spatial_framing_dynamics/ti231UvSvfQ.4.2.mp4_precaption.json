    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **On the deck of a ship, two people are dressed in winter attire. Initially, both individuals stand together. The person on the right, wearing a dark parka with a fur-lined hood and a dark beanie, is the first to walk to the railing and lean against it, looking out at the water. Subsequently, the person on the left, a man in a long, dark winter coat, dark pants, and a dark beanie, walks over to join her at the railing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds on the long, wet outer deck of a large vessel in a cold, overcast environment. The deck is partially covered by an overhanging structure with fluorescent lights, while the open side reveals a vast, gray sea stretching to the horizon. The ship's interior wall is made of white metal and features several watertight doors with heavy latches. A solid, light-colored railing runs along the edge of the deck. An individual wearing a dark parka stands on the deck and walks toward the ship's railing on the right, where she leans against it, gazing out at the sea. Meanwhile, another person, dressed in a long dark coat, walks from the left side of the deck toward the right, eventually stopping near the person at the railing. There are no overlays visible on the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, two people are positioned in the middle ground on the deck of a ship. One person stands in the right middle ground, leaning against the railing and looking out at the sea in the background. The second person, initially positioned in the left middle ground, walks horizontally across the frame from left to right, stopping in the right middle ground near the first person. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the subjects' level.",
