    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot provides a top-down view of a pixelated cave. Initially, the character is in a minecart in the center of the frame, situated in the middle ground on a horizontal railway track. In the background, red slime covers the ground in the top portion of the frame, while a wooden structure occupies the foreground at the bottom. As the character moves from right to left along the track, the camera pans left, keeping the character centered. This movement causes the initial scenery to exit to the right, while revealing new areas on the left, including a large, grey stone archway that appears in the foreground in the bottom-left corner. Throughout the pan, the character and the track remain in the middle ground, traversing from the right side of the scene to the left. UI elements are fixed in position, with a health bar in the top-left, a mini-map in the top-right, and an inventory bar at the bottom.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel-art video game scene, a small character with dark hair, a brown top, and blue pants rides a minecart along a set of railway tracks while holding a lit torch. The area contains several round, orange, translucent, blob-like creatures. Additionally, there are several green plants and a grey stone door frame on the ground, adorned with turquoise decorations.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows a pixelated character moving through a dark, underground cave. The environment is composed of brown dirt walls and floors, illuminated by numerous small torches. A straight railway track initially extends from the center of the frame to the left side. As the camera pans, the tracks continue horizontally across the scene, eventually stretching from the right side of the frame to the center. Large, irregular patches of a red, slime-like substance cover parts of the ground, and several round, orange, gelatinous creatures are scattered throughout the area. As the character walks from right to left along the tracks, the camera pans to reveal more of the cave, including a large, gray, arched rock formation with blue-green details in the lower-left corner. Overlays are visible on the screen: a health bar in the top-left, a mini-map in the top-right, an inventory hotbar at the bottom-center, and controller button prompts in the bottom-right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
