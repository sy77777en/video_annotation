    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a selfie perspective shot featuring a person with light skin, bright pink shoulder-length hair, large black-framed glasses, and a black face mask. They are wearing a dark-colored jacket over a dark t-shirt. In the scene with them is another person wearing a light beige long-sleeved top, dark pants, and white shoes. This second person is bent over at the waist, turned sideways toward the camera and toward the base of a yellow pole on the sidewalk. As the perspective shifts, the person with pink hair moves from the right side to the lower left of the view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors on a sidewalk next to an asphalt road during dusk. The environment is a campus or park-like area, featuring a prominent tree with pink blossoms, while other nearby trees are mostly bare. A grassy, landscaped area separates the sidewalk from background buildings, which include a modern structure with large windows and a more traditional stone building. A black pole on the sidewalk holds a yellow sign displaying two red 'M' letters. A person in a light-colored coat, without a hood, is bent over near a yellow pedestrian signal post, while a person with pink hair, wearing glasses and a black face mask, is in the foreground. The sky is light blue and overcast.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a street scene with two people. It starts with a person with pink hair, glasses, and a black mask, whose chest-up body occupies 50% of the right side of the frame's height. On the left, a person in light clothes is bent down, with their full body occupying less than 50% of the frame's height. The camera then pans right, leaving the pink-haired person in the lower left corner, revealing more of the street.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium close-up from a point-of-view perspective, with a person with pink hair positioned in the right foreground, their upper body filling half the frame's height. In the left middle ground, a second person is bent over near the base of a yellow pole, their full body visible but smaller in the frame. A tree with pink blossoms is located in the left middle ground, with a sidewalk extending from the foreground into the background. A road runs along the right side of the frame, and buildings are visible in the background. The camera, held at the subject's eye level, moves forward and pans slightly to the right, causing the pink-haired person to shift to the bottom left of the frame. This movement also causes the second person to exit the frame on the left, while revealing more of the street and sidewalk ahead.",
