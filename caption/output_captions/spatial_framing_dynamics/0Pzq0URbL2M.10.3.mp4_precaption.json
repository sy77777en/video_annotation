    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows four people standing with their backs to the camera in a dimly lit room, facing a framed portrait. On the far left, a woman with dark skin and short, reddish-brown hair, wearing a dark sleeveless top, rests her hand on the shoulder of the woman beside her. This second woman also has short, reddish-brown hair and is wearing a dark, sleeveless dress. To their right stand two men, both dressed in light green, long-sleeved outfits. The man in the center stands looking forward, while the man on the far right has his head bowed. The group is gathered in front of a table, upon which rests a framed, black-and-white portrait of a man with a mustache, who is wearing a high-collared military uniform.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at night within a dark room with a wooden floor, where the backs of four people are visible as they stand around a small table. On the table is a framed black-and-white portrait of a man in a military uniform. The camera slowly pulls back, revealing the room is part of a traditional Japanese-style building. The wider view shows the building's exterior, featuring a wooden porch, a large barrel, a tree with pink blossoms, and glowing white paper lanterns that illuminate the otherwise dark surroundings.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows several people mourning in front of a portrait. It begins with a wide shot of the portrait, partially blocked by a woman's shoulder. The camera then pulls back, moving past people's shoulders to fully reveal the individuals. It continues to pull back, gradually unveiling a wide shot of the environment around the house where they stand.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot where a framed portrait is positioned in the center middle ground, partially blocked by the back of a woman in the left foreground. The camera slowly pulls back, revealing a group of four people standing in the middle ground, with their backs to the camera, facing the centrally placed portrait. As the camera continues its backward movement, the shot transitions into a very wide shot, framing the scene from outside the building. A large wooden barrel appears in the left foreground, while the branches of a blossoming tree enter from the top left. A glowing paper lantern becomes visible in the right foreground, hanging from the building's exterior. The group of mourners remains in the center middle ground, viewed through the building's open doorway. The camera stays at the subjects' level throughout this transition.",
