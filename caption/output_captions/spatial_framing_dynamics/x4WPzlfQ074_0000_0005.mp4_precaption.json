    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a seascape and underwater scenery shot, beginning at the surface of clear, turquoise water looking towards a lush, green tropical island with a mountainous backdrop under a blue sky dotted with white clouds. The perspective then dips below the surface, revealing a sunlit underwater environment with a sandy and rocky seabed scattered with coral. There is no main subject in this video because the focus is on capturing the expansive natural environment and immersing the viewer in the serene atmosphere of the location. The shot emphasizes the scale and beauty of the tropical setting, both above and below the water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a water-level perspective in a clear, turquoise ocean, a tropical island with lush, green mountains is visible in the distance under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. The camera gently bobs on the waves, offering a split view of the island above and the water below. As the scene transitions to a fully submerged underwater view, the coral-filled seabed is beautifully revealed, with sunlight filtering through the rippling surface to illuminate the sandy and rocky ocean floor.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot with no main subjects. Initially, the camera is positioned at water level, capturing the turquoise ocean surface in the bottom half of the frame from the foreground to the middle ground, with the seabed visible below. A tropical island with green mountains stretches horizontally across the center of the frame in the middle ground, while the blue sky and clouds occupy the top half of the frame in the background. The camera then tilts downwards, submerging completely to reveal an underwater wide shot. In this final view, the rocky and sandy seabed fills the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground, while the water column and the rippling surface occupy the top half.",
