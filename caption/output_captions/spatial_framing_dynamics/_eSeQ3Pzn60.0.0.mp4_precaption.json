    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a light skin tone is shown climbing up a mossy rock face. He is in a crouching position with his right hand on the rocks and his left hand holding a selfie stick. He is wearing a red and black plaid long-sleeved shirt and a dark gray beanie.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot, where the camera is held by the person being filmed, captures a person in a red and black plaid shirt and a dark beanie climbing up a moss-covered, rocky peak. The camera is positioned to look down at the person, revealing a vast landscape in the background. This landscape consists of a dramatic mountain range surrounding several bodies of dark blue water, including a large fjord and a smaller, circular lake. A small coastal town with a harbor is nestled along the shoreline below. The sky displays a gradient of light blue, pink, and orange, indicating either sunrise or sunset, while the immediate foreground is composed of dark, craggy rocks with patches of green and yellow-green moss.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In this wide shot, a man is positioned in the center foreground, climbing up a mossy rock face that occupies the bottom half of the frame. The camera is positioned above him, looking down. In the background, a mountain range and bodies of water fill the top half of the frame, with a small town visible in the middle ground to the right. As the video progresses, the man moves slightly upward toward the center of the frame. He lifts a rock from the foreground with his left hand, bringing it closer to the camera before placing it back down as he continues his ascent. The camera, held by the man, moves upward with him.",
