    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a panoramic view of a modern urban skyline set against a backdrop of distant mountains and a partly cloudy sky. Tall glass and concrete high-rises dominate the horizon, interspersed with mid-rise buildings and lush green trees in the foreground, creating a striking contrast between natural and built environments. The focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the city as it blends into the surrounding landscape, rather than on any specific object or individual, emphasizing the grandeur and expanse of the environment rather than a particular subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a sweeping panorama of Vancouver during a clear, sunny day. In the foreground, the rooftops of low-rise residential buildings are nestled among abundant, leafy green trees and extend into the background. The background is dominated by the city's dense downtown skyline, filled with numerous skyscrapers, including a distinctive white, grid-patterned high-rise. In the far background, a vast range of mountains, some with snow-dusted peaks, stretches across the horizon under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. The camera moves slowly downward, gradually revealing more of the cityscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape from a high-angle perspective, with no specific subject. The scene is layered with depth, beginning with lush green treetops and low-rise residential buildings in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a prominent white, grid-patterned high-rise stands slightly left of center, surrounded by other buildings and trees. The background is dominated by the dense downtown skyline, which extends across the horizontal center of the frame. Spanning the entire width of the far background, a vast mountain range sits under a partly cloudy sky at the top of the frame. The camera slowly moves downward and slightly to the right, causing the foreground trees to rise and gradually obscure the lower portions of the middle-ground and background cityscape.",
