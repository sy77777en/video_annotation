    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays an extreme close-up of a woman's mouth on a large, grid-like electronic billboard. Her full lips are coated in a glossy, bright red lipstick. Superimposed over the center of her mouth is the word \"RELAX\" in a white, capitalized, sans-serif font. The image has a noticeable pixelated texture, and at times, a white, smoke-like vapor drifts in front of the mouth. The red border is part of the electronic billboard's frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, futuristic cityscape at night, towering skyscrapers loom in a hazy atmosphere filled with falling particles. A massive digital billboard, slightly to the right of the center of the frame, displays a close-up of a woman's mouth with glossy red lipstick. The word \"RELAX\" is superimposed in a white, sans-serif font over the image, which is framed by the red border of the electronic billboard. White smoky vapor drifts in front of the woman's mouth. In the background, other dark buildings have scattered lit windows, and a vertical sign with the letters \"HONY\" is visible on the left.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This shot primarily focuses on an electric billboard against a city backdrop. The video captures the billboard in a full shot, while the content on the billboard displays an extreme close-up of a person's lips. Throughout, the shot sizes remain consistent.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: This shot primarily focuses on an electric billboard on a building. The camera height is within the range of this building, but likely lower than the billboard.",
    "pre_caption": "This static, low-angle full shot frames a massive electronic billboard in the right-middle ground against a backdrop of towering skyscrapers. The skyscrapers occupy the background, primarily on the left side of the frame, with one building on the far left featuring a vertical \"HONY\" sign. The billboard itself displays an extreme close-up of a person's lips, with the word \"RELAX\" positioned in the center of the screen. Falling particles are visible throughout the depth of the scene, from the foreground to the background. In the middle ground, a white, smoke-like vapor drifts across the surface of the billboard, moving in front of the displayed image.",
