    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit setting, three crumpled, gray pieces of paper are arranged in a row. Each paper features a single word in glowing white capital letters: \"CHILDREN\" on the left, \"MOTHER\" in the center, and \"PUBLIC\" on the right. Afterward, the paper labeled \"PUBLIC\" rises into the air, and the word \"PUBLIC\" transforms into dense, white fluorescent cursive text. The focus then shifts to a single, dark rectangular page that appears to be a handwritten letter. The text on the letter is written in a cursive style and glows with the same bright, white light. The letter is dated \"4/13/94\" in the top right corner and is addressed \"To whom it may concern\". The page is filled with dense text, some of which appears to be crossed out or redacted. The letter is shown floating in the air against a dark background, with a clearly visible pillow nearby.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit bedroom, three pieces of paper are arranged on a white surface that appears dark due to the insufficient ambient light, in front of a pillow. Each paper displays a single, glowing white word in capital letters: \"CHILDREN,\" \"MOTHER,\" and \"PUBLIC.\" The paper labeled \"PUBLIC\" rises into the air, and the word transforms into dense, white fluorescent cursive text. The paper itself is a letter, dated \"4/13/94.\" The bed, pillows, and nightstand in the background are all clearly visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot from a high angle, three pieces of paper are arranged in the foreground: \"CHILDREN\" on the bottom left, \"MOTHER\" in the bottom center, and \"PUBLIC\" on the bottom right, with a pillow in the background at the top of the frame. The paper on the right, labeled \"PUBLIC,\" rises and moves toward the center, transforming into a full, glowing letter. The camera then shifts to an eye-level, full shot, positioning the floating letter in the center of the frame. In the background, pillows are now visible on the left and a nightstand is on the right.",
