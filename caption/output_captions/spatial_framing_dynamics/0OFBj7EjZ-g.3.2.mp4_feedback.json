    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle full shot of a cluttered area, where two overturned wooden cabinets are positioned in the center of the frame, with other cabinets scattered in the background and to the left. In the bottom right foreground, a portion of a red, faceted head is visible. The two central cabinets are then lifted vertically and move out of the frame, revealing a full shot of a pale blue-gray figure lying on the floor. This figure becomes the central subject, positioned diagonally with its head toward the bottom right. The red head remains in the bottom right foreground, while the other cabinets are situated in the middle ground and background on the left and top sides of the frame. The camera maintains its static, high-angle position throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, shot from a high angle, shows a cluttered area with several low-polygon, stylized wooden cabinets, some of which are overturned. In the center of the scene, two multi-tiered cabinets with slatted side panels appear to be raised and shifted away by an unseen force, revealing a stylized, low-polygon male figure lying face down on the gray, gridded floor. This figure is rendered in a uniform, pale blue-gray color, with his left leg slightly raised on a nearby cabinet. In the bottom right corner, the top of another low-polygon human figure's head is partially visible, rendered in a solid, faceted red color.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective, a scene rendered in a low-poly, computer-animated style unfolds within an indoor space. The dark gray, gridded floor is scattered with small, multi-colored pieces of debris and several overturned, light-brown wooden shelves. Initially, two slatted wooden shelves lie on top of a light blue, faceted human figure. Both shelves are then lifted upwards, revealing the full figure lying face down on the floor. Near the figure's head is the head of a red faceted character.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The scene shows a cluttered area filled with cabinets. A cabinet at the center is initially fully visible but then flies out of the frame, revealing a full shot of a man lying on the floor. Another human figure in red is partially visible, with only a small portion of their head in view.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
