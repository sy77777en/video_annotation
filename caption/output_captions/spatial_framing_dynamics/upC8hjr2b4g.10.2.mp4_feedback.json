    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot focused on a large building. The shot begins with a severe canted angle, showing the top left corner of the building occupying the bottom left of the frame, with the rest of the screen filled by the blue sky in the background. The camera then performs a continuous movement, rolling clockwise while simultaneously tilting down. This motion gradually reveals the entire facade of the building, which moves to occupy the center of the frame and the middle ground. The shot settles on a stable, low-angle composition, with the building centered, a grassy lawn in the foreground at the bottom, and the sky in the background at the top. The camera remains at a low height, looking up at the building throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an architectural scenery shot, beginning with a tilted, low-angle view that rolls clockwise while moving downward and slightly tilting down to reveal a large, imposing building. The structure is a two-story, symmetrical brick building, possibly a school or institution, featuring numerous multi-paned windows that reflect the cool, blue light of the sky. It has a dark roof, a small central porch with white columns, and sits on a grassy incline against a solid, blue sky. There is no main subject in the traditional sense, as the focus is entirely on establishing the location and its somber, slightly ominous atmosphere. The camera's deliberate movement serves to emphasize the scale and starkness of the building within its environment rather than highlighting a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins with a low-angle, tilted view of a large building against a solid blue sky. The camera rolls clockwise while simultaneously moving downward and tilting slightly downward to reveal the full facade of a two-story, dark brick building under dim, even lighting. The symmetrical structure features numerous multi-paned windows that reflect the blue sky. A central entrance is marked by a small porch with white columns and a balcony on the second floor. The building is set on a grassy, unkempt lawn with a worn path leading to the front door. The overall color palette is dominated by shades of blue and dark gray, creating a cool, dim atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
