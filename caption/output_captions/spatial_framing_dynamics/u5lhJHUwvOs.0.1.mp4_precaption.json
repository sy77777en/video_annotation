    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video starts with a close-up on the lower leg and foot of a person sitting on a black padded stool. The person has light skin with a noticeable reddish scar on their lower shin, just above a black sock. They are wearing a black Asics athletic shoe with white and silver stripes and a small orange detail. As the scene progresses, the camera moves and pans, revealing a man with short, thinning hair, wearing a light gray long-sleeved shirt and dark pants, who comes into view from the right side of the background and moves toward the midground. The camera pans to the right while the leg and shoe remain in the foreground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a lit indoor facility with artificial lighting, the camera focuses on the lower leg and foot of a person sitting on a black padded stool. The person is wearing a black sock and a black athletic shoe with white and orange details, and a scar is visible on their leg above the ankle. The floor is a light color. Initially, in the out-of-focus background, another person in a grey shirt walks past a counter area and a blue bin. The focus later shifts to this person as he enters the midground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a person's lower leg and shoe, which are positioned in the center-left foreground. The leg is resting on a black stool that also occupies the foreground. In the out-of-focus background, a second subject, a man, enters from the right and walks toward the center, moving from the background into the midground. As he moves, the camera pans slightly to the right, and the shot transitions into a full shot, making the man the primary subject. The first subject's leg remains in the left foreground during this transition. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
