    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a middle-aged, light-skinned man sitting and facing the camera. He has dark, slightly messy hair and is wearing large, dark-rimmed eyeglasses. He is dressed in a dark blue, short-sleeved t-shirt. Standing or sitting directly behind him is a woman, who is partially obscured. She is wearing a black strapless top, a large white hat decorated with a blue square scarf, and sunglasses. Her hands are resting on the man's shoulders.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor scene takes place on a wide, sandy beach under bright daylight. In the foreground, a man with glasses and a dark blue t-shirt is seated, with a woman in a white hat and black top standing behind him, her hands resting on his shoulders. As the camera pans, a white and orange building gradually appears from the left side of the frame and remains positioned in the upper-left corner. The background consists of a vast expanse of sand with patches of green beach grass, extending to a hazy horizon.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a man seated in the center foreground, with a woman positioned directly behind him in the middle ground. The background is composed of a sandy beach. The camera then slowly zooms in, transitioning to a close-up that more tightly frames the man's head and shoulders in the center of the shot. Throughout this movement, the camera remains positioned at the man's eye level.",
