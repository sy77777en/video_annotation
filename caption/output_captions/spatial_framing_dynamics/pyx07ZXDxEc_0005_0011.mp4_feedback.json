    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a high-angle perspective, positioning the camera directly above the skydiver who is in the center of the frame and the middle ground. Below, a sprawling landscape of an airfield, town, and lakes occupies the background. A small pink drogue chute deploys from a container above the skydiver, followed by the main pink parachute, which inflates in the center of the frame. The shot then transitions to an extreme wide shot as the camera's position changes to be below the subject. In this final low-angle view, the skydiver and their fully open parachute are seen in the upper-center of the frame in the middle ground, ascending away from the camera against a background of blue sky and clouds.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman is shown skydiving, wearing a pink helmet with white goggles, a white short-sleeved top over a white long-sleeved shirt, and light-colored patterned leggings. She is secured in a pink and gray harness. Her parachute system is initially seen as a small black container above her, from which a small pink drogue chute deploys before the main, large, bright pink parachute opens fully. Once the main canopy is inflated, she is suspended in an upright position, holding onto the parachute's risers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-altitude perspective during the daytime, a skydiver descends over a sprawling landscape under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. Below, an airfield with distinct runways and parked aircraft is visible, surrounded by a mix of industrial buildings, roads, green forests, and several lakes. The scene captures the deployment of a bright pink parachute, which unfurls from a small pilot chute into a full canopy. The skydiver, wearing a pink helmet, is suspended beneath it as the view transitions from a high-angle aerial shot to an upward angle showing the parachute against the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to below the subject.",
