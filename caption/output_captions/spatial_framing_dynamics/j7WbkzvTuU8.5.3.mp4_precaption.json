    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three men, viewed from over the shoulder of the first. This man, occupying the center and right side of the view, is bald with pinkish skin and is seen from the back. He wears a dark mask covering his entire face and a high, weathered white collar over dark armor. Initially, he looks down at a young, fair-skinned man with short dark hair who is lying on his back in the first man's arms with his eyes closed, wearing dark armor. The perspective then reveals a third man standing opposite the first. This standing man is middle-aged with short, gray hair, a graying beard and mustache, and a serious expression. He is dressed in elaborate white and gold armor with glowing white lights on the shoulders and chest, featuring two slender lights above the blue section of the armor on both sides, worn over a dark uniform.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An over-the-shoulder POV, where the camera is positioned behind a character with a bald, pinkish head and a weathered white collar, shows a dark, indoor scene. The view begins looking down at a young man with short dark hair lying on a surface. The camera rolls clockwise and pans slightly to the right as it cranes down to a low-angle view filmed at hip level, concluding with an upward tilt and a slight left pan to reveal a man with a graying beard standing opposite. This standing man wears elaborate white and gold futuristic armor with blue panels and glowing light accents. The setting appears to be the interior of a spaceship, with a dark expanse of space and distant stars visible in the background. The scene is dimly lit, with the main illumination coming from outside the view.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is shot from a third-person over-the-shoulder POV, showing three characters. The right side of the frame remains a close-up of one character's back. On the left, the camera first shows a person lying on the ground, then tilts upward to reveal another standing person.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a third-person over-the-shoulder shot, where the back of a bald man's head and shoulders are in a close-up, occupying the right foreground of the frame. On the left, a young man is shown lying down, positioned lower in the frame. The camera then rolls clockwise and cranes down to a low-angle view at hip level. Simultaneously, it tilts upward and pans slightly left, revealing a third man standing in the middle ground on the left side of the frame, opposite the character in the foreground. The background shows a dark expanse of space with distant stars. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
