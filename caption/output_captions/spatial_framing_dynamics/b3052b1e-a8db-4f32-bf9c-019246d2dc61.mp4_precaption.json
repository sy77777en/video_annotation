    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, wavy brown hair styled in a half-up ponytail is seen from behind, walking away from the viewer. She wears a short-sleeved, collared shirt with a pink and green floral pattern on a light background, paired with light-wash blue jeans, and has one black electronic device clipped to her waistband along with a black patterned crossbody bag. In the middle ground, a man with short dark hair, wearing a mustard-yellow shirt and blue jeans, is actively moving a large piece of lighting equipment on a stand. At the lower left of the center background, two men stand conversing; both are dressed in dark suits and fedora hats and eventually move out of the frame. Another man with short dark hair, wearing a black long-sleeve top with gray rectangular patches on the outer sides of the arms and light-colored pants, walks in the middle ground. At the bottom right of the background, a woman wearing a brown coat and a light-colored hat is seated.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot, framing a character from the hip up, follows a woman with long brown hair as she walks through a busy outdoor location during the day. The setting is a paved area in front of a large, tan stone building, which features a prominent khaki sign with black text reading \"STAGE 26\". A white Winnebago RV with blue and grey stripes is parked in the background, surrounded by film production equipment such as large lights on stands. Various people are scattered throughout the scene, some moving equipment and others standing and talking, creating a sense of activity.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman is positioned in the center foreground, walking away from the camera, which follows her movement at her level. In the middle ground, a man on the right pushes a light stand toward the center, while on the left, another man walks from left to center, passing behind two men in suits who are also on the left. In the background, a seated woman is visible in the bottom right, in front of a white RV that extends across the right side of the frame, with a large building marked \"STAGE 26\" occupying the top center. As the central woman and camera move forward, she remains centered while moving deeper into the scene, and the surrounding people and equipment shift their relative positions, creating a dynamic sense of movement.",
