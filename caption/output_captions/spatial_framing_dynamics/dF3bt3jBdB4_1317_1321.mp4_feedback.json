    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of a woman in the foreground, positioned in the center-left of the underwater scene, with a text overlay in the top right corner. As she swims forward at her own level, she turns her body, causing her to shift and occupy the left and bottom portions of the frame. The camera then moves upward, breaking the water's surface, which changes the composition to a view of her back in the bottom-left foreground, while bubbles and the turbulent water surface fill the middle ground and background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long hair tied in a ponytail is shown snorkeling underwater. She wears a pink two-piece swimsuit with white trim, a black snorkel mask, and a black snorkel with an orange tip. She holds a camera at arm's length, capturing a selfie-style view as she swims. White text in the upper right corner reads, \"Tip: use baby shampoo as a defogger!\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot shows a person snorkeling in clear, blue-green water during the daytime. The person, wearing a pink swimsuit with white trim, holds the camera while swimming through the water. They are equipped with a black snorkel mask and a matching black snorkel that has an orange tip. The camera fully breaks through the water's surface, creating bubbles and ripples. In the final frame, the camera is positioned at an oblique angle, showing seawater in the bottom right corner and the person in the bottom left corner. A row of huts and woods is visible along the distant horizon, with the remainder of the frame occupied by the sky. An overlay of white text is present in the upper right corner, which reads, \"Tip: use baby shampoo as a defogger!\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
