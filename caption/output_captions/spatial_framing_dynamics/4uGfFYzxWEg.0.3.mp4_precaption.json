    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a television studio, the main subject, a man with short dark hair, wearing a short-sleeved collared shirt with black, pink, and grey colors, walks along the edge of a circular, glass-floored stage to meet another man, the host, who is wearing a grey suit over a light-colored shirt. The two men shake hands. In the background, a large studio audience of men and women is seated in tiered, curved rows, clapping. In the midground, several other people are seated in a row of chairs at the edge of the circular stage, facing the camera and also clapping.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This scene takes place inside a large, circular television studio with a live audience seated in tiered rows. The set is characterized by dark, atmospheric lighting with prominent blue and purple hues. In the center, a stage features a transparent glass floor over a complex metal structure, illuminated by blue lights. Two large, curved staircases with lit steps ascend from the stage area. In the midground, a row of contestant chairs is arranged, each equipped with a small monitor. Two men are standing at the 12 o'clock position on the edge of the circular stage as the audience claps, and the camera pulls back to reveal the full expanse of the studio. An overlay in the top-left corner displays the text \"ITV - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (2001)\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In an initial wide shot, the main subject is positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, walking towards the center along the edge of a circular stage where the host stands. In the background, a large audience fills the upper portion of the frame, while other contestants are seated in the foreground and middle ground at the bottom. As the two men meet and shake hands in the center-right middle ground, the camera, initially at their level, pulls back and moves upwards. The shot transitions to a high-angle wide shot, revealing the entire studio set. In the final composition, the two men are small figures in the top-center of the frame, with the large circular stage occupying the foreground and middle ground, and the audience surrounding them in the background.",
