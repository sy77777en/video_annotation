    "pre_caption": "The scene opens on a blurry, dark green background in the middle ground, with out-of-focus red and blue bokeh lights scattered in the background. A small cup, initially a blurry shape on the left, enters the frame and moves horizontally towards the right in the middle ground, transitioning the shot from a scenery view to a full shot as the cup comes into sharp focus. As the cup travels across the center of the frame, a stream of reddish-orange liquid is flung out from its rim, trailing behind it towards the right. The cup continues its path, eventually becoming partially visible as it reaches the right edge of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, set against a dark green, out-of-focus background with colorful bokeh lights, features a small, white, cylindrical cup that appears to be floating. The cup, which looks like it could be made of paper or styrofoam, is gently tossed from left to right within the frame. As the cup tilts, a dark reddish-orange liquid is gradually flung out from the rim, creating a smooth, continuous stream. The scene begins blurry, with the cup gradually coming into sharp focus as it becomes visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a small, white, cylindrical cup with a colorful, cartoon-like design moves through the frame against a deeply blurred green background. The scene is cast in a green light, with soft, circular light spots in various colors scattered in the background. As the cup tilts, a dark reddish-brown liquid is smoothly and continuously poured out from the rim.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera begins out of focus, making it difficult to determine the shot type and size, but it appears to be a scenery shot. In the middle of the video, a cup floats from left to right, transitioning to a full shot of the cup. At the end, it moves to the right edge and is partially visible now.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Due to the lack of background information, it\u2019s difficult to determine the camera\u2019s height relative to the subject.",
