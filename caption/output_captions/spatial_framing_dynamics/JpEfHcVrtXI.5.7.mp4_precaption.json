    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, luminous, white creature with a quadrupedal, animal-like form, featuring long ears and a tail, is the central subject. This creature emits a bright white and blue glow and has large, dark eyes. It is accompanied by a small, floating orb of bright blue light. The creature climbs up the right-hand rock face, using translucent, turquoise plants growing there. When the creature interacts with these plants, disc-shaped structures emitting a blue-green light are revealed. To the right is a large, stationary formation covered in sharp, green-glowing spikes. In the upper portion of the scene, a small, reddish-purple creature with a rounded body is visible on a dark ledge.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A side-view gaming video, where the camera is placed to the side to capture the scene in profile, takes place in a dark, bioluminescent forest cavern. The environment is characterized by a deep blue and green color palette, with dark, silhouetted rock formations hanging from the top and forming the sides of the chasm. The wall on the right is lined with sharp, glowing green spikes, while the platforms below are dotted with glowing flora. A misty, ethereal glow permeates the air as a small, white, luminous creature jumps and glides between ledges. After the character jumps onto the rock wall, the upper part of the cave is revealed, showcasing dark vines and stalactite-like structures hanging from the ceiling. On the left platform, there is a yellow-green glowing plant with an orange-glowing hanging lamp above it. An overlay is present at the bottom of the screen, showing a heads-up display with a central circular meter, five blue orbs to the left, and seven yellow-green orbs to the right. A small circular icon containing the number '3' is also overlaid in the top-right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene is captured in an extreme wide shot from a side-view perspective, with the camera initially level with the main subject. A small, luminous creature is positioned in the center-right of the frame, standing on a platform in the middle ground. The scene is framed by a dark, silhouetted rock formation in the top and left foreground and a large, spiky rock wall on the right. A user interface overlay occupies the bottom foreground, with an icon in the top-right foreground. The creature jumps upwards and to the right, moving through the middle ground toward the spiky wall. As it ascends the wall by interacting with glowing plants, the camera tilts and pans upward to follow its movement. This reveals more of the upper cavern, including a small, reddish-purple creature on a ledge in the upper-middle ground and dark vines hanging from the ceiling in the background. The main creature continues its ascent, moving from the center-right towards the top-right of the frame.",
