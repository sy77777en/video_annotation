    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an urban scenery shot from a street-level perspective, capturing a wide-angle view of a city intersection. Initially, there are citizens prominently featured in the foreground and midground: one individual with pink hair, a dark mask, and a dark top, and another with short dark hair and a light-colored shirt and jacket. Both figures soon move out of view, leaving only indistinct shapes of people visible in the distance after the camera pans. The focus is on the setting itself, which includes tree-lined streets, crosswalks, distant brick buildings, traffic lights, and vehicles, creating a sense of place and movement through the urban landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a swift turn at a street intersection on an overcast day. The scene is set in an urban or campus environment, featuring asphalt roads marked with white crosswalks. Green, leafy trees line the sidewalks, and large, multi-story brick buildings are visible in the background. As the view pans across the intersection, a red car, initially partially obscured by a figure on the right side of the frame, becomes more visible before moving out of view to the left. After a brief pause in the camera movement, a silver car appears and remains on the far right, near the crosswalk. Traffic lights and street lamps are positioned at the corners of the intersection.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot of an urban scene begins with a rapid pan from left to right. Initially, a red car is positioned in the bottom-left foreground, moving out of the frame as the camera turns. The view sweeps across a crosswalk in the foreground and trees in the middle ground, settling on an intersection. In the final composition, a crosswalk spans the foreground, while a large tree occupies the left middle ground. A silver car enters from the right and stops in the middle ground on the far right. In the background, multi-story brick buildings are visible on both the left and right sides of the frame. Although some indistinct figures are briefly visible in the middle ground, the focus remains on the scenery. The camera is positioned at street level.",
