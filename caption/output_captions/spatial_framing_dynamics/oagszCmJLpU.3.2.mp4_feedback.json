    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a landscape, captured from a low, stationary camera angle looking across the scenery. A massive storm cloud system dominates the top two-thirds of the frame, positioned in the middle ground and background. Below this, a rural plain with visible crop rows occupies the bottom third of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. In the background, a line of low hills is situated along the horizon, mostly in the bottom-center and bottom-left of the frame, with a band of light visible just above them in the far background. In this time-lapse, the entire cloud formation swirls and expands, moving from left to right and appearing to lower and grow larger, with its dark base progressively filling the right side of the frame. A curtain of precipitation in the middle ground descends from the cloud base and moves from the center toward the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a massive, turbulent storm system moving over a flat, rural plain. The video's focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific object. The sky is almost entirely consumed by a colossal supercell cloud, which is dark grey and nearly black at its base, with lighter grey and white layers swirling above. Below this ominous formation, a vast expanse of green and brown farmland with visible crop rows stretches toward a line of low, distant hills silhouetted against a sliver of bright, warm light on the horizon, from which a curtain of rain appears to be falling.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse shows a massive, dark grey storm cloud system swirling and expanding over a rural landscape. The vast cloud formation, with a dark, heavy base and lighter grey upper layers, dominates the sky. Below, the flat terrain is composed of green and brown fields that extend toward a line of low hills in the distance. A band of warm, golden light from the horizon is visible beneath the storm, silhouetting the hills as a dark curtain of precipitation moves across the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
