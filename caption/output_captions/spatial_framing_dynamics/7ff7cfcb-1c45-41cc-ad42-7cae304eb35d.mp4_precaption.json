    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark environment, a car is initially seen from a distance as a pair of bright, white headlights that cast a prominent horizontal lens flare. As the vehicle moves closer, its form becomes clearer, revealing both white and dark-colored elements. The car proceeds to drive past the viewpoint, briefly showing its top view before moving away. After the car passes, its red taillights are visible as it recedes into the distance, and the environment becomes brighter.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a dark outdoor scene at night. In the upper center, two bright white lights emit a strong horizontal lens flare that stretches across the frame. The surrounding environment is rendered as a dark, brownish-gray blur with prominent vertical streaks, indicating rapid movement. After the car drives directly underneath the camera, the environment becomes brighter.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video opens with an extreme wide shot of a car. As it approaches, the shot shifts to a wide shot, before the car moves away and the framing returns to an extreme wide shot. In the middle of the video, at one point, only half of the car is visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot, positioning a car's headlights in the center background, which cast a horizontal lens flare across the middle of the frame. From a high-angle perspective, the car moves directly from the background toward the foreground along the central vertical axis, causing the shot to transition to a wide shot as the vehicle's form becomes larger. The car then passes directly underneath the camera, moving from the center to the bottom of the frame, where its top half is briefly visible before it exits. After passing, the car's taillights appear in the center, receding from the foreground back into the background as the framing returns to an extreme wide shot. The dark, blurry environment with vertical streaks consistently fills the space surrounding the car throughout its movement.",
