    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a humanoid figure wearing a full-body, form-fitting, bright yellow suit, captured in a dynamic, crouching pose on the side of a building. Further along the wall, a cluster of dark, reddish-brown, monstrous-looking figures with less defined shapes are clinging to the ornate, grayish-white stone facade. An old-fashioned, dark metal lamppost with a single glowing bulb is positioned vertically on the concrete sidewalk in front of the building, remaining parallel to the wall. A dark road marked by yellow lines is situated next to the concrete sidewalk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This scene depicts a surreal, curved city street during an overcast day. The environment is dominated by tall, ornate, white buildings with a weathered texture and rows of rectangular windows. A dark asphalt road with yellow lines runs along the base of the building, extending far into the background. A single, old-fashioned streetlamp with a glowing orange light is positioned vertically on the concrete sidewalk in front of the building. A small figure in yellow is visible on the building's facade, while other, darker figures cling to the wall further up the curved street.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot captured from a low, tilted angle, a yellow-suited figure is positioned in the foreground at the bottom left, crouching on the side of a large building that occupies the left and center of the frame. The building's facade curves away from the viewer, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. A lamppost is also in the foreground, situated near the center of the frame and running parallel to the building. Further along the building's wall in the middle ground, a cluster of dark figures is visible near the center. A dark road fills the right side of the frame, curving from the foreground into the distant background. The camera is positioned below the subjects, looking up along the disorienting, curved cityscape.",
