    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a person wearing a dark, full-body suit with white or light-colored gloves and footwear. The individual is seen tumbling and falling, changing orientation continuously as they move through space high above the Earth, which is visible with its blue surface and white cloud cover.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The shot begins from a high vantage point in space, focusing on a figure in dark clothing. As the camera tilts downward, the Earth's curved outline gradually enters the frame from the bottom, eventually filling the entire view with the Earth's surface. Throughout this sequence, the figure is depicted falling toward the Earth from space, with the vast expanse of blue ocean and dense, white cloud cover visible below.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person tumbling in space. It starts with a wide shot, then shifts to a full shot as they move closer, and returns to a wide shot as they move away.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject and then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot, showing a person positioned in the top center of the frame, falling feet-first through the middle ground against a black background. The camera is initially positioned below the subject. As the person tumbles forward, moving toward the camera and briefly into the foreground as a full shot, the camera tilts downward, revealing the Earth, which rises from the bottom to fill the entire background. The perspective then shifts to a high-angle shot from above the subject. The person continues to fall away from the camera, moving from the center toward the bottom of the frame and receding back into the middle ground, transitioning back to a wide shot against the planetary backdrop.",
