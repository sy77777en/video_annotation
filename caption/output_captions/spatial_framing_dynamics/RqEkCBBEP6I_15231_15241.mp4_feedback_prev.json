    "pre_caption": "This third-person perspective video maintains a medium shot of a man in the foreground, with the camera positioned at his level. Initially, the man is in the bottom-left of the frame, with a stationary subway car occupying the center and right middle ground. As the character moves left, the camera pans with him, causing the subway car to shift to the right and eventually exit the frame. This movement reveals train tracks running from the foreground into the background down the center of the scene, with graffiti on a wall in the center-right middle ground and a lit passage in the distant background. The man then moves toward the right side of the frame, and the camera follows, panning right to keep him in the foreground. This action brings a debris-covered platform into view in the right middle ground as the character moves past the central train tracks.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This third-person perspective video follows a man with short, slightly wavy dark brown hair and a dark beard. He is shown from behind, wearing a dark, long-sleeved coat over a collared shirt, with a brown leather satchel slung over his shoulder. He holds a dark pistol in his right hand and uses a flashlight in his left hand, which casts a bright, circular beam of light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot frames the character from the hip up as they walk through a dark, dilapidated, and partially flooded subway tunnel. The scene is primarily illuminated by the character's moving flashlight beam, revealing grimy concrete walls, support pillars, and train tracks running through the center of the uneven, rubble-strewn ground. A stationary white subway car, covered in colorful graffiti including the word \"ALiCE,\" is stopped on the tracks. The surrounding walls are also marked with spray paint, featuring yellow directional arrows and the recurring phrase \"FIND ALICE\" in large, dripping white letters. As the character moves to the left, a narrow passage becomes visible, with mottled and damp walls and a ceiling featuring crisscrossing metal pipes. Strong red and blue lights emanate from the corridor at the end of the passage. Moving to the right, there is a platform piled with cardboard boxes, pipes, and other debris, with a solitary red and white traffic cone among the rubble. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays a heads-up display with icons and numbers for a handgun and ammunition, showing the weapon magazine currently holds 6 out of 25 bullets. A semi-circular progress bar indicates the character's current health, and below this, a long bar displays the number 2 on the left.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a third-person perspective game video. The camera follows the character from behind, showing him in a medium shot while leaving more space for a wide shot of the scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
