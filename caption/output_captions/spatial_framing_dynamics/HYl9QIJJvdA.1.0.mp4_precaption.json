    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a level-angle view, a woman's bare foot with dark-painted toenails is seen on a wooden floor. This light-skinned woman, who has blonde hair and is wearing a purple top, then gets down on her hands and knees. A ring is visible on one of her fingers as she places her hands on the floor. She brings her face close to the ground and looks ahead from underneath a dark, obscuring object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, the scene is captured from a level angle, looking out from underneath a large, dark piece of furniture. The floor is smooth and reflects a faint light. In the background, the dark legs of other furniture are visible. A person's bare foot with dark-painted toenails is initially on the floor, and their hand, wearing a ring, and a portion of their body are visible. A small, dark object with a blinking red light sits on the floor nearby.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins from a perspective beneath what appears to be a bed, showing a woman leaning down to look underneath. The upper half of the frame is dark, likely obscured by the bed. In the lower part, a pair of feet is visible, followed by hands. As the scene progresses, the woman kneels, bringing her head close to the ground while facing the camera. By the end, only part of her face and arms remain visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is framed from a static, low-angle perspective, looking out from underneath a dark object that obscures the top half of the screen. Initially, a woman's bare foot is positioned in the lower center of the frame, resting on the floor in the middle ground. To the right of her foot, a small, dark object sits on the floor. In the background, the dark legs of other furniture are faintly visible. The woman then moves into the frame from the right, getting down on her hands and knees. Her hands land on the floor in the middle ground, one on the left and one in the center. She continues to move forward, bringing her upper body and head into the lower portion of the frame, positioning her face in the center as she looks toward the camera's low vantage point.",
