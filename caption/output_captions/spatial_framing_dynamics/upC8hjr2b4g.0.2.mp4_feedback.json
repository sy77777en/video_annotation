    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a humanoid figure positioned in the bottom-left foreground, facing toward the right. A closed door occupies the right side of the background. In the bottom-left foreground, a text overlay is present. The focus then pulls from the foreground figure to the background door, causing the figure to become blurred while the door comes into sharp focus, transitioning the scene into a wide shot.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a humanoid figure with pale, featureless skin and short, dark, curly hair. This figure is shown from the chest up, wearing a blue short-sleeved shirt and has a joint connection similar to that of a doll's hand on its left wrist. It is sitting up, partially covered by a blanket with black and brown patterns, and has its right hand resting on its head with fingers in its hair. The figure is positioned on the left side of the frame, facing the right side of the frame, with a closed, white, paneled door with a dark lever handle in the background. Throughout the video, the focus shifts from the humanoid figure in the foreground to the door in the background, causing the figure to become blurred while the door becomes sharp and clear.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit bedroom at night, bathed in a cool, blueish light. In the background, a closed, white, six-panel interior door with a black lever handle is visible. In the foreground, a figure with short, dark hair and a featureless white face sits up in a bed, which is covered by a blanket with a black-and-brown pattern. The figure is wearing a blue t-shirt and has one hand raised to their head. An overlay in the bottom-left corner of the screen displays the text \"February 2013\" in a white font, which fades out at the end of the video.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a humanoid subject wearing a blue outfit in an indoor room, with one hand resting on their head. It begins with a medium close-up shot of the subject. As the camera moves, the focus gradually shifts from the humanoid in the foreground to a door in the background, revealing a wide shot of the scene. However, the humanoid subject remains partially visible in the frame, showing their upper body but appearing blurred.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
