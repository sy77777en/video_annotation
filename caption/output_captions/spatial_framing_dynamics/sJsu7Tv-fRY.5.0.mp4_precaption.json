    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This urban scenery shot establishes a sense of place and atmosphere, capturing the ground level of a stark, concrete apartment building with a row of identical blue doors set against a pebbledash facade. An unkempt patch of overgrown grass and weeds separates the building from the dark asphalt pavement in the foreground. In the lower-middle section of the frame, a small rodent, likely a mouse, is briefly visible, moving slightly before becoming still. The focus is on conveying the environment's overall condition of neglect and decay, using the unmaintained landscape and functional architecture to create a bleak mood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor scene shows the ground level of a multi-story residential building with grey, pebbled concrete walls. A row of blue doors, each with a narrow vertical window, lines the building's facade. In front of the apartments, a patch of unkempt ground is covered in overgrown green grass and weeds, bordering an asphalt surface in the foreground. On the left, two silver-colored metal utility boxes are positioned next to a doorway. A small, dark rat is moving in the lower-middle part of the frame on the asphalt. Above the ground floor, a portion of the upper level is visible, featuring a balcony and a red-trimmed roofline. The scene is filmed during the day under overcast skies.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, static scenery shot filmed from a low angle. The foreground is occupied by a dark asphalt pavement at the bottom of the frame, where a small rodent is briefly visible moving in the lower-center. In the middle ground, a patch of overgrown grass and weeds stretches across the frame, situated in front of the ground floor of a concrete apartment building. This building, with its row of blue doors, extends from the left to the right side of the frame. Two metal utility boxes are positioned in the left middle ground, next to a doorway. The upper portion of the building, including a balcony, is visible in the background at the top of the frame.",
