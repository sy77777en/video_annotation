    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel-art scene viewed from above, a character with light skin and short gray hair, wearing a red shirt, blue pants, and brown boots, walks across a narrow wooden plank to a small grassy island in a river. On the island, the character picks up a small, brown, potted plant-like item with green leaves. After collecting the item, the character walks back across the plank to the main grassy area. In the upper left, a grey, carved stone figure resembling a totem pole stands among some bushes, but this figure moves out of view from the left side when the main character walks vertically across the narrow wooden plank.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view presents a vibrant, pixel-art outdoor scene set in the morning. A wide, blue river flows through the environment, which is characterized by green grassy areas, dirt paths, and small cliffs. The landscape is dotted with pine trees and bushes. Simple wooden fences run along the land, and a series of small wooden plank bridges connect the mainland to islands within the river. A character moves from the mainland, crosses a bridge onto an island, picks up a brown and green potted plant, and returns. Several overlays are visible: a toolbar with tools that usually appears at the top center but occasionally shifts to the bottom center, and a display in the top right showing the in-game time as morning, the date as 'Tue. 2,' a gold count, and other information. A temporary text box in the bottom left identifies the collected plant as 'Wild Horseradish.'**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a high-angle, top-down perspective, a character is initially positioned in the center of the frame on a small peninsula in the middle ground, with a river to their right and a larger landmass to their left. The character walks up across a wooden plank onto a small island, causing the camera to pan slightly up to keep them centered. After picking up an item, the character walks back down the plank and moves left onto the mainland, with the camera panning down and left to follow. During this movement, a toolbar at the top center of the frame temporarily shifts to the bottom center before returning to its original position. As the camera pans left, a stone figure in the top-left background exits the frame, and a blue structure enters from the top left. A temporary text box also appears in the bottom-left corner when the item is collected.",
