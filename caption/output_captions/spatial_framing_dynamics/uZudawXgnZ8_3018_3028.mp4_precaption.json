    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a third-person, top-down 2D game scene, two pixelated characters stand on a wooden pier. The character on the left has blue hair and wears a red top with blue pants. To their right stands a man with a brown beard, wearing a red shirt and a brown hat. A dialogue box subsequently appears in the lower portion of the view, featuring a more detailed pixel-art portrait of the man from the chest up, confirming his brown beard, red shirt, and brown hat.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides, captures a pixel-art scene at a beach. A brown wooden pier extends over a large body of blue, rippling water. Situated on the pier is a small wooden building with a red-tiled roof and a sign depicting a fish. Two small, pixelated characters stand on the pier. An overlay dialogue box is present at the bottom of the screen, featuring a wooden border, a portrait of a bearded man in a hat named \"Willy,\" and text that reads, \"Ah... I'm still tryin' to unwind from a month out on the salty seas... It was a big haul! I sold a lot of good fish.\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a third-person, top-down 2D game video. It begins with an extreme wide shot of two characters on a seaside pier. Later, a game dialogue box appears in the lower-middle part of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a third-person, top-down 2D game video, presented as a static extreme wide shot. A wooden pier extends from the top left of the frame into the middle ground, where a small building is located in the upper-left quadrant. Two small characters stand on the pier in the upper-middle of the frame, to the right of the building. In the background, a sandy beach lines the top edge of the screen. The blue ocean occupies the majority of the frame, filling the foreground, middle ground, and the entire right side. Subsequently, a dialogue box appears, occupying the bottom portion of the frame. Within this box, a character portrait is positioned in the bottom-right corner, with text to its left. The camera maintains a fixed, high-angle perspective throughout the video.",
