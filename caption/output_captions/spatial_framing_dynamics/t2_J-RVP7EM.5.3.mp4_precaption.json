    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Three light-skinned hands are arranged in a triangular formation on a dark, wood-grained surface, all pointing toward the center. The hand at the top left, which appears to be a man's, has a black tattoo covering the forearm and wears a ring with a green gem and a white symbol. The hand at the top right, likely a woman's, has colorful bracelets on the wrist and wears a ring with a red gem and a white symbol. Positioned at the bottom center is a third, more slender hand that appears somewhat grimy, wearing a ring with a light-colored gem and a dark symbol.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit setting, three hands are positioned on a dark, textured wooden surface. The scene is viewed from directly above, showing two hands at the top and one at the bottom, forming a triangular arrangement. The hand on the top left, with tattoos visible on the forearm, wears a ring with a green, gem-shaped icon. The hand on the top right, adorned with colorful bracelets, wears a ring with a red, house-shaped icon. The hand at the bottom center wears a ring with a white icon resembling the letter 'N'. The lighting is focused on the hands, creating a strong contrast with the surrounding darkness and highlighting the grain of the wood.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static, close-up shot filmed from directly above, three hands are arranged in a triangular formation on a wooden surface in the middle ground. One hand is positioned at the top left of the frame, a second is at the top right, and a third is at the bottom center. All three hands are oriented toward the center of the frame, with their fingers nearly touching. The entire composition is tightly framed by a dark vignette, which places the hands and the central part of the wooden table in a focused circle of light.",
