    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A 3D animation rendered entirely as a point cloud shows a brown, open-topped rectangular box. Inside the box stand two identical, bright red, bottle-shaped objects with a textured, slightly draped surface. The red bottles then rapidly disintegrate, transforming into an impressive, dense cloud of red particles that expands to completely fill the interior of the box, appearing almost solid.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a black background, a brown, open-topped box rendered from small particles is shown. Inside the box stand two red, bottle-shaped objects, also composed of particles, which give them a textured appearance. The red bottle shapes dissolve and form a rectangular block that fills the entire container and appears almost solid. The entire scene, including the box and its contents, is rendered in a grainy, particle-based style. An overlay of white text at the bottom left corner of the screen displays \"[21]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Due to insufficient background information, it is hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a full shot of a brown, open-topped box positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. Initially, two red, bottle-shaped objects stand side-by-side within the center of the box. The two red shapes then rapidly disintegrate, and their particles expand upwards and outwards to form a single, dense, rectangular mass that completely fills the lower interior of the centrally located box. The camera and the box remain stationary throughout the transformation.",
