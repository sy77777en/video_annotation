    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a man is initially positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of a minimalist chamber, appearing to float horizontally. The camera, at the subject's level but severely tilted, captures the surrounding curved walls and recessed panels. The entire frame then undergoes a rapid clockwise rotation. This movement shifts the man from the center to the top of the frame, making him appear to fall upside down. Concurrently, the chamber's orientation within the frame changes, and the scene darkens, with illuminated panels becoming visible on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with a black crew cut is walking normally in a room. He is dressed entirely in black, including a black shirt, trousers, and shoes. The video features alternating bright and dim lighting, which somewhat obscures the details. The sense of him floating or falling is an illusion created by the camera's clockwise rotation, giving a tilted perspective.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a large, minimalist indoor chamber with smooth, curved, light-colored walls, all cast in a cool, blue-green hue. The space features recessed rectangular panels with subtle edge highlights, and the lights flicker alternately, creating a dynamic atmosphere. A figure dressed in dark clothing moves through the center of this environment. The camera perspective rolls and shifts, providing various tilted views of the chamber's interior and creating a disorienting sense of rotation.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
