    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A long passenger train travels along a single track. The train is composed of many cars, the majority of which are dark blue with a silver roof and feature rows of small, rectangular windows illuminated with a white light from within. At the front of the train is a distinct red passenger car, which also has windows, with the blue cars attached behind it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone pulls up to reveal a long passenger train, composed of blue cars and a single red car with illuminated windows, as it travels along a straight track. The train moves through a vast, rural landscape of green, rolling hills dotted with dark green trees. In the distance, mountains are visible under a grey, heavily overcast sky. An overlay in the top right corner displays the text \"AI-generated voice,\" and there is another overlay in the bottom-left corner displaying \"[2].\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of a train positioned in the bottom left of the frame and the middle ground. The camera is at the train's level. The camera then pulls back and moves upward, transitioning to a wide, high-angle shot. In the final framing, the train is seen from above, traveling away from the camera along a track that recedes from the bottom left toward the center background. The train occupies the middle ground, with a green landscape in the foreground and middle ground, and hills and mountains in the background.",
