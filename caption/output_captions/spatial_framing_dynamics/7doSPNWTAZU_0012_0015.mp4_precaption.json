    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man with short, dark hair, viewed from behind, wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved button-up shirt and light-wash blue jeans. He is surrounded by four other men. To his left stands a man in a long-sleeved sweater with horizontal pink and dark stripes and blue jeans. In front of the main subject is a man wearing a purple short-sleeved shirt, a purple vest, blue jeans, and black-and-white shoes with red accents on the toes. To his right, another man is wearing a green shirt with orange floral accents, blue jeans, and white shoes. Partially visible behind the main subject is a fifth man with short, light-colored hair, wearing a brightly patterned short-sleeved shirt and blue jeans.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in an indoor studio with a seamless cyclorama wall. The environment is bathed in a purple light that creates a gradient effect, transitioning from a light lavender near the floor to a deeper violet at the top. The floor itself is a reflective, off-white surface. In this space, five people in colorful, casual clothing are captured in motion, moving around the brightly lit area.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a man in a white shirt stands in the center of the frame and the middle ground, with his back to the camera. He is flanked by two other men in the middle ground: one in a striped sweater to the left and one in a green floral shirt to the right. In the right foreground, a man in a purple vest moves from the center towards the right edge of the frame. As the video plays, the man in the purple vest continues walking toward the right and slightly into the background, eventually exiting the frame. The central subject remains relatively stationary, while the other men shift slightly behind him. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
