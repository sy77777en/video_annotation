    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A grayscale map of central and eastern Europe is shown, with the countries of Germany, Poland, and Ukraine labeled in dark, uppercase text that gradually fades out. A light blue line, representing a flight path, originates from a light blue dot in the western part of Germany, near the coast, and extends eastward across Germany, Poland, and through Ukraine. A small, light blue airplane icon is depicted moving along this path. A dark blue line indicates the portion of the route already traveled by the airplane, partially covering the light blue path starting from Germany.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A stylized, grayscale map of Central and Eastern Europe is displayed. Dark text identifies the countries \"GERMANY,\" \"POLAND,\" and \"UKRAINE,\" with the text gradually fading out. A light blue line, representing the flight path, originates from a blue dot in northwestern Europe and extends eastward across Germany, Poland, and through Ukraine. A dark blue line indicates the portion of the route already traveled, partially covering the light blue path starting from Germany. A small, blue airplane icon moves along this path, transitioning from Poland into Ukraine. The map has a soft focus and a vignette effect, with the flight path and airplane icon being the only colored elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a high-angle perspective, a grayscale map of Europe fills the background. A flight path, depicted as a light blue line, starts from a blue dot in the top-left and stretches across the frame towards the bottom-right. Initially, a small, blue airplane icon is positioned in the center of the frame over Poland, with a dark blue line tracing its traveled route from the top-left. The country labels \"GERMANY,\" \"POLAND,\" and \"UKRAINE\" are visible in the center-left, center, and center-right areas. Throughout the shot, the airplane icon moves steadily from the center towards the center-right, crossing from Poland into Ukraine, while the dark blue line extends behind it and the country labels gradually fade out.",
