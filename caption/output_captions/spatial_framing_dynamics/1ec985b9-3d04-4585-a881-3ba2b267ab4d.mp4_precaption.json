    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An out-of-focus, light-skinned person is seen lying on their back on a wooden floor. This individual wears a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt and dark-colored pants. Their arms are raised toward the viewer, with their hands held up in a gesturing motion. All specific details, including facial features, hair, and expression, are completely obscured by the heavy blur.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space with wooden floors, captured from an objective perspective. The entire view is heavily blurred and has a grainy texture. In the background, the indistinct shape of a light-colored couch is visible. A large, blue exercise ball is situated in the background, while a blue bottle is in the middle ground. A person is lying on their back in the center of the room and transitions to sitting up by placing both hands beside their head. Various other out-of-focus objects are scattered across the floor.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot from a high angle, capturing a person lying on their back in the center-middle ground of a room. In the background, a couch occupies the left side of the frame, while a large blue ball is positioned on the right. A blue bottle is visible in the right middle ground. The person then sits up, moving their upper body forward and upward toward the camera. This movement transitions the framing into a close-up, with the person's upper body now occupying the center foreground, and the camera's perspective changes to be at the subject's level.",
