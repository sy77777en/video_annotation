    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man and a woman are dancing and embracing in a dimly lit, festive setting. The man has voluminous, curly, blonde hair and is wearing a light-colored suit jacket. The woman has long, straight, blonde hair. They are holding each other closely, with the woman's arms wrapped around the man's neck, and they are both smiling.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor, dimly lit scene is saturated with a hazy, red glow, with out-of-focus orbs of green, purple, and bright yellow light visible in the space. Hanging from the dark ceiling are star-shaped decorations that reflect the colored lights. Within this soft-focus environment, a woman with long, loose hair and a man with short, curly hair that reaches his shoulders dance and embrace. The pervasive red light and soft focus obscure most details, creating a warm, atmospheric setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows unknown of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up centered on the back of a woman's head and a man's shoulder in the foreground. The shot then widens slightly to a medium close-up as the couple embraces and sways, remaining in the center of the frame. The man is positioned on the right and the woman on the left, and they turn slowly together as they dance. In the background, out-of-focus orbs of red, green, and yellow light are visible at the top of the frame, with hanging star decorations positioned above the couple. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, moving with them to maintain the central framing.",
