    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a street-level cityscape of a street corner, likely during dawn or dusk under a bright sky. The scene includes a crosswalk, dark grey traffic poles with yellow bands, and a partially visible red SUV on the right. Lush green trees line the sidewalk and background, with a large, pink blossoming tree positioned in the midground, indicating a spring setting. The camera's wide, more distorted perspective is used to capture the overall environment and atmosphere of the location. The focus is on the setting itself\u2014the interplay of urban infrastructure and natural foliage\u2014rather than on any single person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, captures an outdoor scene at a street intersection during a bright day, likely at dawn or dusk. The setting features a paved road with white crosswalks positioned further into the scene, bordered by concrete sidewalks. In the foreground and midground, dark grey traffic light poles are marked with bright yellow bands. A dark red SUV is partially visible on the right side of the road. Lush green trees and a tree with pink blossoms line the street, set against a pale, uniform sky, while other cars are visible in the midground. Some streetlights cast a warm glow, indicating the fading daylight.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This static, wide shot captures a street corner from an eye-level perspective, using a wide-angle lens that creates a distorted view. A red SUV is partially framed in the bottom right foreground. A tall traffic pole extends from the foreground to the top of the frame in the center-right. The sidewalk occupies the bottom left foreground, leading into the middle ground where a road with a crosswalk is positioned centrally. In the left middle ground, a pink blossoming tree is visible, with other trees and foliage situated across the middle ground and background.",
