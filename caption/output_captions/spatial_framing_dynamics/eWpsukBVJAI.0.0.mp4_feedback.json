    "pre_caption": "The scene begins as a medium shot, frozen in time, with a man's torso and a splashing mug of beer occupying the left and center foreground. In the right middle ground, a seated man in a booth leans forward. The camera then moves horizontally to the right, reframing the composition into a medium shot focused on a new central subject. This movement shifts the man holding the beer to the center foreground, making him the primary subject. Consequently, the splashing beer moves to the right foreground, and the seated man is pushed almost entirely out of the frame to the far right. The camera's movement also reveals a second standing man in a suit, who now occupies the left middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white man with brown hair initially appears on the left and then moves to the center, wearing a black leather jacket over a collared shirt, a striped tie, and a police badge on a chain around his neck. He holds a large glass mug of beer, from which foam and liquid are splashing upwards in a frozen-motion effect, and he looks forward with a slight smile. To his left and slightly behind him, a seated Black man with short, dark-colored hair that reflects a golden hue under the light, is wearing a black vest with a dark jacket. He leans forward with a concerned expression, raising his right hand. In the midground, behind and to the right of the white man, another white man with short brown hair and glasses is visible, dressed in a brown suit jacket and a striped tie.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a dimly lit bar, characterized by dark wood paneling and the corner of a dark green upholstered booth. The environment is cast in a warm, yellow light that creates deep shadows. Light-colored curtains and a light-colored wall with a dark wooden panel add to the ambiance. In the center of the shot, a clear glass mug filled with dark beer is held up, with a thick white head of foam appearing to splash out of the top in a frozen-motion effect. A person in a leather jacket and tie holds the mug, while another person sits in the booth, reacting to the splashing beer. As the camera moves, the center of the shot shifts to focus on the person holding the mug, while the person sitting in the booth almost completely moves out of view, revealing another man to the left.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera captures a scene frozen in time. It begins with one person seated on a sofa, while another person might be to the left on the sofa, but their face is not visible. A standing man holding a glass cup is also in view. As the camera moves, another man comes into view, while the man holding the glass cup becomes the center of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
