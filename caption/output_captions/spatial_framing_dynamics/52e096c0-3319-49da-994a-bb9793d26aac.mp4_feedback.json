    "pre_caption": "The shot begins with a view of an illuminated cityscape at night in the background, then the camera tilts upward and trucks slightly left to reveal a woman in the foreground. In the resulting medium full shot, the woman is positioned in the center of the frame, standing in front of a large window. The cityscape of skyscrapers occupies the background, extending across the entire frame behind her. The camera is positioned at the woman's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a medium shot, as the camera tilts upward while slightly trucking leftward, revealing a woman with light skin and short, dark hair styled in a pixie cut. She wears glasses with white lenses, a white sleeveless top with thin black straps, and a high-waisted, shiny black skirt. Her accessories include a thin black choker and a silver-colored bracelet on each wrist, and she wears black sheer stockings. The woman is standing with her left knee bent and raised, her left hand resting on it, while her right arm hangs naturally at her side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors at night, within a room of a high-rise building, with a sprawling cityscape of illuminated skyscrapers filling the background. The numerous building windows glow with yellow and white light, creating a blurred, grid-like pattern against the dark sky. In the foreground, a woman wearing glasses, a white top, a black skirt, and black stockings stands in front of a large glass window. The video is presented in a widescreen format with a black letterbox bar at the bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a medium full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
