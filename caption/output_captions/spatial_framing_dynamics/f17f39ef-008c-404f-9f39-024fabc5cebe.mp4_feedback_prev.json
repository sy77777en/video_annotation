In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of bare tree branches frame the scene from the bottom, top, left, and right, creating a network across the entire frame.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a time-lapse scenery shot of a forest canopy, capturing the transition from dusk to deep night. The perspective is from the ground looking straight up, where the stark, black silhouettes of gnarled, leafless tree branches form an intricate network against the sky. The sky itself transforms from a pale, hazy blue to a deep, dark expanse, gradually revealing a dense field of tiny, twinkling stars. As full darkness settles, glowing orange embers or sparks appear to drift upwards in a time-lapse manner through the frame. The video lacks a specific main subject, as its purpose is to convey an atmosphere of quiet transition and to emphasize the majestic scale of the night sky as it is revealed through the natural frame of the wintery trees.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a worm's-eye view looking up through a canopy of bare trees, the scene transitions from dusk to night. The light blue sky gradually darkens into a deep, dark blue, revealing a multitude of stars. The dark, silhouetted branches of the trees, with their gnarled and intricate shapes, remain in view against the changing sky. During the night sequence, faint, glowing orange streaks briefly float upward through the branches.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
