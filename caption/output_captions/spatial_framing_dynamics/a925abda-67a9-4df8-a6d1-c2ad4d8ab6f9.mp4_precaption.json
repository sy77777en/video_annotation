    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a bird's-eye view, top-down perspective, four people are positioned around a drum set on a red, mottled floor with a white grid pattern. A person with long, dark hair, wearing a white sleeveless top and dark red pants, is seated at the drum set, which features golden-brown shells and brass-colored cymbals. To their left, a person with short, brown hair stands playing a guitar, dressed in a solid dark red suit. On the right side of the scene, a third person with curly, brown hair stands, wearing a red and white patterned outfit, and another person is on the lower-right side of the scene dressed in solid dark suits. Black cables run across the floor, connecting the performers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye view, the scene is set in an indoor space defined by a unique floor. The floor consists of a white grid frame holding transparent panels, revealing a mottled red and dark-colored surface below. A drum kit with gold-colored shells and cymbals is positioned on the grid. Four individuals are arranged around the musical equipment: three dressed in shades of red and one in dark colors. Black cables snake across the transparent surface. The entire scene is captured with a slight, continuous rotational movement.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured from a high-angle, bird's-eye perspective directly above, a drum set is positioned in the upper-left quadrant of the frame, with a drummer seated behind it. To the drummer's left, at the top of the frame, stands another performer. A third individual is located on the right side of the frame, while a fourth person is partially visible at the bottom. All four subjects are arranged on the same ground plane, which is a white grid floor covering the entire background. Black cables run across the floor, connecting the performers. The entire scene undergoes a slight, continuous clockwise rotation.",
