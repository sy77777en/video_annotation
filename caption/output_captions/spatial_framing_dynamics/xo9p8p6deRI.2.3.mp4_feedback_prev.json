    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery, which transitions into a wide shot. This is a scenery shot with no main subject. From a high-angle, bird's-eye perspective, the camera looks down on a monochromatic miniature model of a suburban neighborhood. Initially, the entire frame is filled with abstract white block houses on a black ground plane. The camera then slowly zooms in and moves forward, gradually focusing on a single, more detailed model of a two-story house that comes to rest in the center of the frame. This central house is positioned in the middle ground, surrounded by the other less-detailed models. A text banner reading \"ROBERT KARDASHIAN'S HOUSE\" remains fixed at the bottom center of the frame throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a miniature model cityscape, depicting a sprawling suburban neighborhood from a bird's-eye perspective. The scene is rendered in a stark, monochromatic style, with simple, blocky white buildings set against a black ground plane, connected by a network of winding roads. The camera initially shows the vast, uniform layout with a slight motion blur before slowly zooming in to isolate a single, more detailed model house, which is identified by the text \"ROBERT KARDASHIAN'S HOUSE\" at the bottom of the screen. There is no main subject in the initial wide shot; the focus is instead on the scale and anonymity of the suburban environment, establishing a sense of place before singling out one specific location.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a high-angle, monochromatic shot, the camera moves over a miniature architectural model of a sprawling suburban neighborhood. The landscape consists of a dark, flat surface with winding roads, populated by numerous simple, white, block-like structures representing houses. The camera slowly zooms in and focuses on a single, more detailed model of a two-story house, which stands out from the surrounding abstract shapes. An overlay at the bottom of the screen displays the text \"ROBERT KARDASHIAN'S HOUSE\" in a stylized font within a dark banner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
