    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot of a street scene from a forward-moving perspective, likely from a vehicle. The overcast sky fills the top half of the frame in the background. In the middle ground, a large tree is positioned on the far left, with a traffic signal structure spanning the center. A white SUV is located in the bottom right of the frame, and a dark sedan is to its left near the center, both in the middle ground. As the camera moves forward, the vehicles in the middle ground grow slightly larger in the frame, with the white SUV also drifting toward the right edge. The camera is positioned at a low height relative to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video simulates a first-person perspective of someone walking through an urban environment on a gloomy, overcast day. The expansive grey sky dominates the upper portion of the view, while below, a white SUV is visible in the lower-middle part of the frame at the beginning. As the camera pans to the left, the SUV exits the frame, revealing a girl with shoulder-length pink hair, wearing sunglasses and a black mask. The scene is dimly lit, with the soft glow of streetlights and the dark silhouettes of trees and buildings lining the periphery. The focus is on the overall atmosphere and the transient experience of moving through the city, emphasizing the environment and the flow of movement rather than a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene captures a city street under a uniformly light-grey, overcast sky. Illuminated streetlights cast a yellow glow, indicating either dusk or dark daytime conditions. The camera pans left to capture the opposite end of the sidewalk. A white SUV exits the frame from the lower right, while a girl with pink hair enters from the lower left and swiftly moves to the lower right. Dark, leafy trees line the left side of the road, with the silhouettes of distant buildings visible against the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
