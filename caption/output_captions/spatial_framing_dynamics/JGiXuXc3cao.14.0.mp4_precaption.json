    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A collection of four white, unpainted model ships is arranged on a flat, grey surface against a dark teal background. In the background and slightly out of focus is a large, modern cruise ship with multiple decks lined with numerous small, square windows. In the mid-ground to the left is a smaller, older-style ship with a single smokestack. Also in the mid-ground on the left is a medium-sized vessel, possibly a workboat or research ship, featuring a distinct bridge and deck structures. To the right in the foreground, the stern and mid-section of a similar-style vessel are visible, showing details like lifeboats and deck equipment. All the models have a matte finish and lack any color or markings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stylized indoor setting, several unpainted white model ships are arranged on a flat, light gray surface representing water, set against a solid, dark teal background. A large, multi-decked cruise ship is positioned in the background, while smaller vessels of varying designs occupy the mid-ground and foreground. The scene is rendered in a monochromatic style, with soft lighting creating subtle shadows on the models.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures four model ships arranged to create depth on a flat surface. In the foreground on the right, the stern of one vessel is positioned closest to the camera. To the left in the middle ground, a medium-sized workboat is visible, with an older-style ship positioned slightly behind it. A large cruise ship occupies the background, centered in the frame and extending towards the right. The camera is positioned at the level of the subjects, and the shot remains static.",
