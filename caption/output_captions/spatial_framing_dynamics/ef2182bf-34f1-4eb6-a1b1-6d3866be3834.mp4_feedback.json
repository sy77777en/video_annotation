    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a person seen from behind, positioned in the center-left foreground. This person runs forward and toward the right side of the frame, while in the background on the right, a woman stands near a pool behind a fence. As the camera follows the person, the shot transitions to a full shot, showing them moving along a path in the foreground toward a black gate in the middle ground. Another person, initially seen in a full shot in the middle ground on the right, walks from behind the fence toward the center to open the gate. The video concludes in a medium-full shot with the first person in the left foreground and the second person in the center middle ground holding the gate open, revealing the pool area in the background. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, seen from behind, runs towards a black metal gate wearing a loose light blue T-shirt, blue-green shorts, and a light-colored baseball cap worn forward. As he reaches the gate, another man in a blue-green top and dark shorts approaches from inside the fenced area on the right and opens the gate for him. As the camera briefly pans across the fence, a woman in a light-colored bikini is visible standing just inside the enclosure near the gate.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person perspective shot follows a person walking through a residential community at dusk. The scene is dimly lit by a few warm, round outdoor lights. The person moves from a grassy area onto a red brick pathway leading to a tall, black metal gate enclosing a swimming pool. Several white signs with black and red text are posted on the gate and fence, including a prominently placed \"POOL HOURS\" notice detailing access times and pool regulations. Through the bars of the fence, the blue water of the pool is visible, surrounded by a concrete deck and lounge chairs. The camera continues to follow as the person enters the pool area through the open gate.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of a person seen from behind. As the person moves forward, the shot transitions to a full shot, revealing a new person who appears fully visible at first. The video ends with a medium-full shot showing both individuals.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
