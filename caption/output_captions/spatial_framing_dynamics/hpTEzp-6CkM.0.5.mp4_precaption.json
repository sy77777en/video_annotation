    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man and a woman seated at a low table in a traditional room, suggesting a Japanese tea ceremony. The man on the left is wearing a traditional gray kimono and has dark hair with a noticeable bald patch, styled into a small bun at the back. The woman on the right is dressed in a dark red striped kimono with a prominent blue sash adorned with white floral patterns. Her dark hair is styled in a bun, and she is kneeling, facing the center of the frame with her shoulders slightly straightened. Both individuals are facing away from the camera, looking at a man who suddenly appears in the center of the frame, dressed in a modern style with a black short-sleeved shirt, dark trousers, and a dark baseball cap.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting, likely a traditional Japanese room, characterized by sliding wooden doors and tatami mats. The time of day appears to be during daylight, as natural light softly illuminates the space. The room is furnished with a low wooden table, around which individuals are seated, having dinner. The decor includes a framed picture on the wall and a few traditional items, enhancing the cultural ambiance. The scene remains consistent throughout, focusing on the gathering.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: In a Japanese-style room, a man and woman in kimonos dine as the camera films them from behind, facing the doorway. A young man wearing a hat backflips from the right side of the frame into the doorway\u2019s center, then exits to the left. It's overall a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a full shot filmed from the subjects' level, looking into a traditional Japanese room. In the foreground, a man in a kimono is seated on the left and a woman in a kimono is seated on the right, both positioned behind a low table in the center and facing away from the camera. Their focus is directed toward the middle ground, where a large open doorway dominates the center of the frame, revealing another room in the background. A second man, wearing modern clothing, suddenly enters the scene from the right side of the background doorway, performs a backflip that lands him in the center of the middle ground, and then quickly exits the frame to the left, disappearing from view.",
