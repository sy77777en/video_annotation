    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a medium close-up of a white man with light brown, neatly combed hair and light-colored eyes. He is wearing a dark suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a dark, patterned tie. His expression is serious as he stands and turns his head, his gaze shifting from side to side as he observes something off-camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a large, artificially lit indoor facility with a serious, official atmosphere. The background is dominated by expansive wall-mounted boards covered in grids of white numbers and text against a dark surface, suggesting a data-processing or code-breaking center. The lighting is subdued, creating a low-contrast, cool-toned visual style. A man in a dark suit and a white collared shirt with a tie is present, and the camera follows him as he moves through the space. In the blurred background, other indistinct figures, some in what appear to be military uniforms, are visible in the open-plan room.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a close-up shot of a man who begins in the right-center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. As he turns his head, the camera pans slightly to follow, keeping him as the central focus. He moves through the scene, and the camera tracks him, causing the background elements\u2014initially a wall with horizontal blinds, then a large board with grids of numbers, and finally a more open room with indistinct figures\u2014to shift behind him. The man is consistently framed from the shoulders up, and the camera remains at his eye level throughout the sequence.",
