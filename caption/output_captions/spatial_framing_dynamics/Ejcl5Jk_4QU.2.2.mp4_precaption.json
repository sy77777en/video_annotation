    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit room with a green hue, a woman with short, graying hair lies on her back on a bed. She is wearing a dark sweater over a red shirt, and her eyes are closed. Standing over her is a Black individual dressed in dark clothing. They hold a clear, glass-like object, resembling a mask or respiratory assistance equipment, pressing it onto the woman's face as they look down at her.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, cluttered room with a pervasive green tint. In the midground, a person lies on a low bed covered with dark red and black blankets. Standing over them, a second person holds a piece of equipment. The room is filled with indistinct objects, including a workbench in the background and a tangle of reflective wires hanging from the equipment above. A dark fabric partition hangs in the background, with a small, warm, glowing light source visible. The overall environment is shadowy and filled with makeshift-looking equipment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot filmed at the subjects' level, a person lies horizontally across the foreground, occupying the bottom half of the frame from the left to the center. A second individual stands in the middle ground, positioned in the center-left of the frame, leaning over the person on the bed. This standing figure lowers a glass object onto the face of the person lying down. In the background, a workbench is visible on the left, while a dark fabric partition hangs in the center-right. A tangle of wires hangs from the top left in the middle ground, and a small, warm light glows from behind the background partition.",
