    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A polygonal male figure, rendered in shades of white and gray, stands with his back to the viewer on a large, red, rectangular pillar, holding a phone to his right ear. As the scene progresses, another red pillar rises to the right, revealing a white, polygonal, L-shaped desk and a matching office chair with a striped backrest. A second white, polygonal figure is situated on this red pillar, posed as if walking toward the right side of the frame, but remains stationary.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, abstract digital environment, a low-poly figure in shades of white and gray stands on the top surface of a large, red cube. The scene expands to reveal an adjacent, slightly elevated red platform holding a white, low-poly desk and office chair, as another figure in similar shades runs past them. The entire scene is rendered in a geometric, low-poly style with strong overhead lighting that creates high contrast, giving the figures an appearance of glowing. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"[3.17]\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video opens with a full-body shot of a polygonal male figure standing on a red rectangular pillar at the center. As a cube rises in the upper right, another figure appears beside a desk and chair.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle, full-body shot of a polygonal figure standing in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on top of a large red pillar. As the scene progresses, a second red pillar rises into view in the upper right quadrant, expanding the middle ground. On this new platform, a desk and chair materialize in the middle ground, to the right of the first figure. A second figure also appears on this platform, positioned in the background to the far right, captured in a pose that suggests movement toward the right edge of the frame. The camera maintains its fixed high-angle position, looking down as the scene expands to include both pillars, with the first figure now occupying the center-left middle ground and the new elements filling the upper right.",
