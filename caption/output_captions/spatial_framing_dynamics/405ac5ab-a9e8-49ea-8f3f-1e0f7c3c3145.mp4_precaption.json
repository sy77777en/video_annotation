    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two children are seen from behind as they move away from the camera. The child in the foreground has dark, braided hair and wears a light-colored knit sweater with blue and yellow horizontal patterns. A blue and white striped garment is visible at their waist. Ahead of this child, a second, smaller child is partially visible, wearing a light-colored cardigan over a red top and light-colored shorts.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a third-person over-the-hip POV shot, the camera follows two children as they trot from a dark hallway into a brightly backlit room during the day. The destination room features a large window covered by sheer, vertical blinds, which casts the interior in silhouette. A dining table and chairs are visible against the bright, greenish-white light from the window. Initially, a shelving unit is positioned on the left side of the midground, but as the camera moves forward, it transitions into the darker foreground. The scene has a grainy texture and is defined by the high contrast between the shadowed foreground and the illuminated background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a child in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground and framed by a dark doorway in the foreground. As this child moves forward, a second, smaller child appears in front of them, also in the middle ground. The camera follows them, transitioning the shot to a medium full shot as they move away into a brightly lit room in the background. During this forward motion, a shelving unit on the left shifts from the middle ground to the foreground, while the two children remain in the center, advancing toward the background where a dining set is located. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
