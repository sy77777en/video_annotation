    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man wearing a grey t-shirt, dark pants, and a blue and orange helmet performs a stunt on an orange trials bicycle with silver wheel rims. He rides up a steep, trapezoidal concrete structure, balances on its narrow top edge, and then hops the bike off the side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor scene is set in a harbor at low tide during the day. A stone sea wall lines the background under a sky filled with white clouds and patches of blue, with a more distant landscape visible through an opening in the wall. The exposed harbor floor consists of dark, wet mud where several sailboats and motorboats are beached, with lighter-colored sand in the foreground. A large, trapezoidal concrete block sits on the sand, where a person on a bicycle rides up its sloped side and jumps off the top.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In this wide shot, a man on a bicycle begins on the left side of the frame in the middle ground. A large concrete structure occupies the center of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. Several beached boats are positioned in the middle ground on either side of the structure, with a stone sea wall in the background. The man rides from the left toward the center, moving up the sloped side of the structure, which elevates him higher in the frame. After balancing on top, he hops the bike to the right, landing back in the middle ground on the right side of the structure. The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level, but as he moves to the top of the structure, the camera is then positioned below him.",
