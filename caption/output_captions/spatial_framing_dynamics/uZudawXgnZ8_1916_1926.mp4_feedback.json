    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a high-angle, overhead perspective, a pixel-art character initially stands in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground of a grassy clearing. This clearing is surrounded by pine trees and bushes and is bordered by a river and sandy shore, which occupy the top and bottom-right portions of the frame. As the character walks, the camera pans to follow, first moving slightly down and left. The camera then pans up and to the left, revealing a cliff edge with a pink-blossomed tree in the left middle ground. Finally, the camera follows the character as they walk down and left towards the lower riverbank, keeping the character relatively centered throughout the sequence. Static UI elements remain fixed in the top-right corner and at the bottom of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel-art style, a character with spiky gray hair, a red shirt, and blue pants stands in a grassy clearing. The area is filled with green pine trees and bushes. Among the standard evergreens, a tree with a vibrant, pink, blossom-filled canopy is visible on a small cliff to the left. The clearing is also dotted with small white flowers and gray rocks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view captures a pixel-art landscape, where the camera dynamically follows the character's movement. The outdoor setting is a vibrant green, wooded area adjacent to a river with a sandy shore, populated with numerous pine trees, bushes, and fallen logs. As a character in red clothing walks across the grass, the camera simulates movement by initially shifting slightly downward and to the left with occasional pauses, then moves upward and to the left before continuing downward and to the left, again with intermittent pauses. This unique camera motion reveals a cliff edge with a pink-blossomed tree. Overlays are visible on the screen: in the top right, a display indicates the time is afternoon on the first day of the month; at the bottom, a toolbar shows various tools, an inventory slot, and an energy bar.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
