    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a woman with light skin and long brown hair lying on her side, wearing a brown knitted sweater with a white collar. She covers her mouth with one hand, her eyes wide open and looking upward. In the background, a man with short dark hair and light skin is partially visible, wearing a dark jacket and holding a flashlight, which casts light in the direction of the woman. The woman\u2019s posture and the way she covers her mouth suggest she is trying to remain silent or hidden as the man\u2019s presence becomes apparent.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an extremely dark and confined indoor setting, the scene is dominated by deep shadows. A person is revealed lying down, wearing a brown knitted sweater. The background is mostly obscured, with only a few out-of-focus, warm-toned lights and the faint, blurry shapes of other people visible in the darkness. The environment is dimly lit, with the majority of the space enveloped in black.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a medium shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with an obstructed view, where a dark object in the extreme foreground fills the top of the frame. As this object lifts upward, it reveals a medium shot of a woman lying down, positioned in the bottom center of the frame and occupying the middle ground. In the background, a partially visible man is located on the left, while blurry figures and out-of-focus lights are situated on the right. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
