The illuminated city skyline fills the background across the upper portion of the frame, with silhouetted palm trees visible in the middle ground to the right of the taxi.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A red taxi cab is shown from the rear, driving on a road at night. The car has a yellow, illuminated sign on its roof with the word \"TAXI\" in white capital letters. Its red taillights are lit, and the California license plate reads \"5049974\". The numbers \"5102\" and the phone number \"800-146-TAXI\" are visible on the trunk. In the background, a city skyline is composed of numerous tall buildings with their windows lit up against the dark sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place at night on a multi-lane freeway, with the camera following a red taxi cab from behind. In the background, the illuminated skyline of a large city, identifiable as Downtown Los Angeles, rises against the dark sky, with silhouettes of palm trees visible. The red taxi features an illuminated yellow \"TAXI\" sign on its roof, and its rear displays the number \"5102,\" a phone number \"800-146-TAXI,\" and a California license plate. The car's red taillights are on as it moves along the road with other distant traffic.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
