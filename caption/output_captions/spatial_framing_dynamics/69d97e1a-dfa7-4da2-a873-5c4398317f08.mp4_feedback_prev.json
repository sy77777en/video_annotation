    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot where a layer of foam occupies the lower half of the frame, with the sharpest bubbles positioned in the middle ground. The immediate foreground at the bottom edge and the background in the upper half are both out of focus. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking across the surface of the foam. The camera then tilts down, causing the in-focus foam to recede toward the top of the frame. As this happens, a blurred, off-white surface in the foreground expands to fill the lower portion of the scene. By the end, the foam is primarily in the upper section of the frame, and a blurred, white elliptical object becomes visible in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This close-up shot features a layer of foam composed of numerous small, spherical bubbles clustered together. The foam has a muted, greenish-blue hue. The surfaces of the translucent bubbles are glossy and exhibit iridescent qualities, reflecting subtle patches of blue and yellow. The ultra-shallow depth of field causes the bubbles in the midground to appear sharper, while both the foam in the foreground and background are softly blurred.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An ultra-shallow focus shot captures a surface covered in a dense layer of small, translucent bubbles. The spherical bubbles are tightly clustered together, their surfaces shimmering with iridescent reflections of blue. As the camera moves, the off-white ground becomes visible from the lower part of the frame, while the foam area shifts to the upper part. The entire scene is bathed in a muted, grainy, greenish-blue light, with the background blurred into a soft, uniform color. The bubbles exhibit a subtle, almost imperceptible movement. At the conclusion of the video, a white elliptical object appears in the bottom right corner of the frame.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a close-up shot of some foam. As the camera moves down, the foam leaves the camera, and everything becomes out of focus.",
