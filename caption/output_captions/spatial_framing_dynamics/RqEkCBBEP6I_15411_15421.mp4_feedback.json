A silhouetted figure stands in the right background. The anomaly then vanishes, and as the character moves forward along train tracks that recede from the bottom of the frame, the camera pulls back from a chest-up view to a medium shot, then a wider shot. This transition reveals the full context of the collapsed tunnel in the background, with the silhouetted figure now standing amidst the rubble on the right. Yellow caution tape is strung across the middle ground, while bloodstains and an evidence marker are visible on the bottom right. A metal barricade and sandbags occupy the right middle ground.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a single character, viewed from behind, who appears to be a man with short dark hair, wearing a dark jacket. He is holding a handgun with both hands, arms extended forward in a ready stance, and his posture is alert and focused. The camera initially frames the character from the chest up, then gradually zooms out to show more of his upper body and eventually a wider view, maintaining the character as the central subject throughout. In addition to the main character, there is a silhouette of another man positioned in front of and to the right of him, adding depth to the scene. The bright, crescent-shaped light source ahead emphasizes the outlines of both figures and the weapon being aimed. No other notable objects are present in the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot, framing a character from the hip up, moves through a dark, collapsed train tunnel with a green-tinged, foggy atmosphere. The scene is illuminated by portable work lights and a flashlight, revealing rough rock walls and train tracks leading toward a pile of rubble blocking the path. Yellow caution tape is strung across the tracks, near bloodstains and a numbered evidence marker on the ground. To the right, a metal barricade and sandbags are visible. A stationary, white, spherical anomaly with a rainbow-colored sheen briefly materializes at the end of the tunnel, obscuring a silhouetted figure in the fog before vanishing. Overlays are present on the screen: in the lower left, white text reads \"COLLAPSED TUNNEL,\" \"MISSING FBI AGENT,\" and \"PLOT BOARD\"; a heads-up display in the bottom right shows an ammunition count of \"6/25\"; and white subtitles at the bottom center display the dialogue: \"It's bad luck to be on this case,\" followed by \"The cult can get you anywhere, with that black magic shit,\" and finally, \"Let the day shift handle it.\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a 3D game video. The camera follows the character\u2019s movements from behind. Initially, the character is shown from the chest up, then the camera zooms out to a medium shot, leaving more space to reveal a wide shot of the scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
