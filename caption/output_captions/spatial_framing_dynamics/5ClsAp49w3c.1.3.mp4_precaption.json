    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a dystopian cityscape scenery shot, revealing a vast, fog-shrouded industrial wasteland. The camera moves slowly and pans slightly across a desolate canyon littered with scrap and murky water, flanked by the enormous, skeletal husks of rusted metal structures that resemble the decaying hulls of colossal ships or abandoned high-rises. A thick, greenish-gray mist permeates the environment, obscuring the full extent of the decay and contributing to an oppressive, bleak mood. There is no main subject; the focus is intentionally placed on the immense scale and desolate atmosphere of the environment itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone moves slowly backward through a vast, desolate outdoor scrapyard under a dim, hazy sky. The scene is shrouded in a thick, greenish-gray fog that obscures the distance. On either side of a central, debris-strewn path, the skeletal superstructures of massive, deconstructed ships or buildings tower upwards. These dark, heavily rusted metal frameworks are in various states of ruin, with exposed skeletal frameworks and jagged edges. The ground is a chaotic mixture of mud, murky puddles, and a dense litter of scrap metal. The entire scene is rendered in a monochromatic palette of dark greens, grays, and browns.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide scenery shot captures a vast, desolate industrial landscape. The scene is framed as a canyon, with the skeletal remains of massive, rusted structures occupying the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground deep into the middle ground. The bottom of the frame shows a debris-strewn path with murky water. The background is obscured by a thick, greenish fog. The camera slowly pulls backward and pans slightly to the left, a movement that gradually reveals more of the ruined structures in the foreground and widens the perspective of the central canyon. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up at the towering structures, which emphasizes their immense scale.",
