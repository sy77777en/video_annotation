    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In an initially upside-down high-angle view that transitions to a tilted high-angle view, a shirtless person with a muscular build, wearing dark pants, is seated on a dark, cruiser-style motorcycle. They are using both hands to remove a white helmet. Seated behind them is another person wearing light-colored pants and a dark top, who is removing a dark helmet. The motorcycle features prominent chrome details on its engine and handlebars that reflect light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a monochromatic, indoor setting, the scene features a painted silhouette of an urban environment on the wall in the background. A cruiser-style motorcycle, with its chrome handlebars and engine glinting, is seen from an inverted and rolling filming perspective, creating a tilted appearance. Two individuals are seated on the motorcycle, both in the process of removing their helmets. A small rectangular lattice casts a prominent light, contrasting with the metallic parts of the bike.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In an inverted high-angle full shot, a motorcycle with two riders is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. In the background, a city skyline silhouette is visible at the bottom of the inverted frame. The camera then rotates counter-clockwise, transitioning the scene from its initial upside-down orientation to a tilted high-angle view. Throughout this movement, the motorcycle and its riders remain centrally framed in the middle ground.",
