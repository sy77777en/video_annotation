    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of the Venetian waterfront, centered on a grand, white marble church. The church features a classical facade with columns and statues, a large central dome, and two flanking bell towers. To its sides, a line of colorful buildings in shades of yellow and orange with terracotta roofs stretches along the canal. The turquoise water in the foreground ripples as the camera's perspective shifts noticeably, and the lighting transitions from a warm, golden-hour glow to brighter, more direct sunlight. There is no single main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall architectural ensemble and the unique atmosphere of the city, capturing the scale and beauty of the Venetian environment rather than isolating one specific building.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A view from above the water captures a waterfront scene in Venice, Italy, during either sunrise or sunset, under a clear sky. The warm, golden light illuminates a row of buildings lining a wide canal, transitioning to a more blue hue later on. Dominating the center is the Gesuati church, a large, white stone structure with a classical facade featuring columns, statues, a central dome, and two flanking bell towers. Adjacent to the church are multi-story buildings painted in shades of yellow and orange, with terracotta roofs. The greenish-blue water of the canal has small waves, and small docks are visible along the promenade. The perspective shifts significantly, as if viewed from a moving boat.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot of a Venetian waterfront. The scene begins with an extreme wide shot taken from a low angle near the water's surface. The water fills the bottom of the frame in the foreground, while the line of buildings occupies the middle ground across the horizontal center. A prominent white church is initially positioned in the center-right of the frame. The camera then moves forward and to the right, transitioning the view into a wide shot. This movement reframes the scene, placing the church directly in the center of the frame, making it appear larger, while the water remains in the foreground at the bottom and the sky is visible in the background at the top.",
