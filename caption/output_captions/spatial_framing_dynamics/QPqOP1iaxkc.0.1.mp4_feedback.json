The station's steel structure and tracks dominate the top half of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the background. A sign for \"Marcy Av Station\" is positioned in the center middle ground. A man in a black coat is in the foreground, walking down a staircase that extends from the bottom left towards the center; he moves from the center-right of the frame toward the bottom center. A large, dark gray van occupies the right side of the frame, from the foreground to the middle ground. In the bottom left middle ground, a woman in a leopard-print outfit walks away from the camera. A silver car is visible in the center background, behind the man on the stairs.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features several subjects at an elevated train station. A man with a light skin tone, long dark hair, a beard, and a mustache is seen walking. He wears a black coat, a black beanie, and carries a white tote bag over his shoulder. In the middle ground, a woman with a light skin tone and brown hair is dressed in a leopard-print outfit, consisting of a top and pants. A dark gray van is positioned on the right, and a silver sedan is visible further in the background. A green sign for the \"Marcy Av Station Manhattan\" is centrally located, indicating service for the J, Z, and M subway lines.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor, daytime scene is set at the entrance to the Marcy Av Station in New York City. The station is an elevated structure, characterized by a dense network of green and rusted steel girders that form the overhead tracks and platform. A green sign with white lettering identifies the station and the J, Z, and M train lines bound for Manhattan. At the bottom of the metal staircase, next to the top of the door frame, a green lamp post with a white globe light is positioned. Below the elevated structure, traffic, including a dark gray van, is visible on the street as a person descends the stairs.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",
