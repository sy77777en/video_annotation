    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Initially, the focus is on a man and a woman seated across a dinner table. The woman, with dark hair styled in an updo adorned with yellow flowers, wears a pale yellow gown with a wide neckline and a necklace. She smiles while looking down, as the man beside her, with silver-gray wavy hair, looks at her and smiles. He is dressed in a formal coat with elaborate gold embroidery on the collar and shoulders. The focus then shifts to an older man and a woman in the foreground. The older man, with white hair and prominent sideburns, is wearing a formal coat with a high red collar. He is shown in profile, looking toward a woman seated to his left. Her dark hair is styled in an updo, revealing a necklace and an earring on one side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the setting is an opulent indoor banquet hall. Guests in period attire are seated at a long dining table in ornate, gilded chairs. The room is filled with warm, ambient light, reflecting off a large, silver candelabra placed on the table. The table setting includes glassware and elaborate food displays, such as a small, tiered white cake. In the middle ground, a woman in a pale yellow dress with flowers in her hair sits beside a man in a black jacket with gold embroidery. The foreground is partially obscured by the back of the woman on the left, the out-of-focus golden part of the chair in the lower left corner, and the side profile of an older man with white hair, who is wearing a black coat with a high red collar.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: At a palace banquet table, the camera is positioned behind a man and a woman. The focus is on the pair seated across the table in a medium shot. As the focus shifts to the man and woman in the foreground through rack focus, the shot changes to a close-up shot of them.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene begins as a medium shot from an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. A man and a woman are seated in the middle ground, centered in the frame at a banquet table. The composition is framed by out-of-focus elements in the foreground: the back of a woman on the left, the side profile of a man on the right, and the top of a gilded chair in the bottom left. A rack focus then occurs, shifting the plane of sharpness from the middle-ground couple to the foreground subjects. This changes the shot to a close-up, bringing the man on the right and the woman on the left into focus, while the couple in the middle ground becomes blurred but remains centrally positioned in the background.",
