    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot from the perspective of a vehicle driving down a wide, wet road at night. Rows of bright streetlights line both sides of the multi-lane thoroughfare, their glow reflecting off the slick, dark asphalt. Other vehicles are visible, some parked along the curbs and others moving in the distance, their headlights and taillights contributing to the nocturnal urban glow. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall atmosphere and environment of the night drive. The composition emphasizes the repetitive patterns of light and the vastness of the urban road, creating a sense of movement and place rather than focusing on a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures a drive along a wide, multi-lane road at night. Rows of bright streetlights on tall poles line both sides of the road, casting a yellowish-white glow onto the wet, dark asphalt. The damp pavement reflects the lights, creating streaks of light on its surface. Cars are parked along the right shoulder, and the dark silhouettes of trees are visible behind the lights. In the distance, the headlights and taillights of other vehicles are visible on the road ahead.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a scenery, captured from a low, forward-facing camera position. The wet road occupies the bottom and center of the frame, stretching from the immediate foreground into the center background. In the middle ground, rows of streetlights line the left and right sides of the frame, receding into the distance, with parked cars visible along the right side. The lights of distant vehicles are visible in the center background. As the camera moves forward, the road appears to flow from the background toward the bottom of the frame, while the streetlights and parked cars on the sides move from the middle ground toward the foreground before exiting the frame's edges.",
