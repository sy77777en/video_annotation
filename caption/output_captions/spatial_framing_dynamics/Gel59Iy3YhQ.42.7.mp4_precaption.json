    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a car viewed from the front, two anthropomorphic animal characters are visible through the windshield. In the passenger seat sits a dark blue, cat-like creature with large, round, red eyes, pointed ears, and whiskers, wearing an orange shirt. In the driver's seat is a light grayish-blue, alligator-like creature with a long snout showing sharp teeth, half-lidded eyes, and a dark shirt featuring a partially obscured symbol with a bottom resembling a cross. Dark speech bubbles occasionally appear above the head of the character in the driver's seat, displaying text.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set at night, viewed from the front of a car looking through its windshield. The car's two bright yellow, circular headlights are on, illuminating the immediate foreground. In the background, dark, silhouetted trees are visible against a deep purple, blue, and red night sky. The front of the dark-colored vehicle features a silver-colored grille with horizontal slats. Through the windshield, the car's dimly lit, blue-tinted interior is visible, containing two cartoon-like animal figures and a rearview mirror. Black, rectangular boxes with rounded corners serve as overlays and occasionally appear above the head of the character in the driver's seat, displaying text in a cyan, pixelated font. The first box reads \"ANYWAY\" and then disappears, followed by a second box that appears and reads \"THIS IS A PARTY\".**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This full shot is framed from the front of a car, which is centered in the scene. The car's headlights and grille occupy the bottom foreground. Through the windshield, in the middle ground, a cat-like character sits on the left side of the frame, while an alligator-like character is positioned on the right. In the background, silhouetted trees are visible. A speech bubble appears in the top right of the frame, in the middle ground above the alligator character. This bubble initially displays text, then disappears and is replaced by a second bubble in the same position. The camera remains stationary at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
