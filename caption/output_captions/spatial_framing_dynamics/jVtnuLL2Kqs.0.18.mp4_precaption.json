    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a panoramic cityscape shot of London's South Bank. The camera's quick motion captures the expansive urban environment and its atmosphere, rather than isolating a single person or object. The shot pans from left to right across the brown, sun-dappled waters of the River Thames, starting with a partial view of the iconic Tower Bridge's stone tower and blue suspension cables. The camera then swiftly moves past a modern residential complex with stacked, glassy levels and an adjacent green park, before revealing the distinctive, rounded glass facade of City Hall and the towering, pointed silhouette of The Shard against the bright, hazy sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A quick pan from left to right reveals a modern London cityscape across the River Thames on a bright, hazy day with clouds. On the left, a portion of Tower Bridge is visible with its blue suspension structure and stone tower. The camera moves across the brown, sun-dappled water to focus on the opposite bank, which features a mix of contemporary architecture, including a multi-tiered residential building with glass balconies. In front of these buildings, a green park and promenade line the river, with people scattered along the walkway. As the pan continues, the distinctively rounded, glass-paneled City Hall building comes into view on the right, with the tall, pointed silhouette of The Shard appearing in the background. A white watermark is present as an overlay in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot of a cityscape, which contains no major subjects, begins with a partial view of Tower Bridge in the left foreground. The River Thames occupies the bottom foreground and middle ground of the frame. Across the river, a modern residential complex and an adjacent park are situated in the center middle ground, with other buildings visible in the background. The camera then performs a quick pan from left to right. This movement causes Tower Bridge to exit the frame on the left while shifting the residential complex to the left side of the view. The pan concludes by revealing the rounded City Hall building in the right middle ground and the tall, pointed silhouette of The Shard in the right background. The camera maintains a slightly elevated position, looking across the river at the opposite bank. A watermark is present in the bottom right corner throughout the shot.",
