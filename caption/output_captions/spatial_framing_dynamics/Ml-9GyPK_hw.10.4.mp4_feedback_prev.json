    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot frames an older woman on the left and a younger woman on the right, both in the middle ground. The older woman is positioned more centrally, while the younger woman is seen in profile on the right edge of the frame, slightly closer to the camera. In the background, a bright sun flare occupies the top left, with out-of-focus green foliage filling the rest of the space. The older woman holds her hand to her chest, and as the scene progresses, the younger woman moves her hand from the right to place it on the older woman's left shoulder. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An older woman with shoulder-length red hair is seated on the left, wearing a blue and white striped top. She has a white, translucent sheet mask covering her face, with cutouts for her eyes, nose, and mouth, and she is speaking with her hand on her chest. To her right, a younger woman with short, dark hair is seen in profile, also wearing a white sheet mask that covers parts of her cheeks and chin. The younger woman, dressed in a pink striped coat over a white top, listens to the older woman and eventually places a comforting hand on her shoulder.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a garden at sunset, two women are seen with white, translucent sheet masks on their faces. The scene is illuminated by a warm, golden light, with a bright sun flare visible in the upper left. The woman on the left, who has red hair and is wearing a blue and white striped top, is speaking. The woman on the right, partially in view, listens and places a hand on the other's shoulder. The background is filled with out-of-focus green foliage.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
