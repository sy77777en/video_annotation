    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A simple black-and-white drawing depicts a figure wearing a hat and riding a sled, rendered in a minimalist, sketchy style. The figure's scarf is composed of red, blue, and green blocks. The figure moves along a black line that starts as a gentle slope and gradually becomes steeper, eventually reaching an almost vertical angle. Upon reaching the end of the line, the figure and the sled glide into the air. In mid-air, the figure separates from the sled, and abstract black geometric lines flash by.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video, the scene is set against a plain, light gray background. A thin, black diagonal line initially forms a gentle slope, gradually becoming steeper and more counter-clockwise until it is almost vertical. A small, abstract figure composed of black lines with small red and blue accents slides down this line. As the figure reaches the end of the line, it and the sled glide into the air. The line then vanishes from view as they leave it behind. In the air, the figure separates from the sled, and they continue to rise. Several times, fragments of one or two abstract black geometric lines sweep rapidly from top to bottom around them.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is difficult to infer the camera height relative to the subjects for 2D videos.
