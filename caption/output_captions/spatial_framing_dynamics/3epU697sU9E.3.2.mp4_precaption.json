    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a 3D animated model of an airport scene. Initially, a large, four-engine jet airplane is visible in the foreground. The plane has a primarily white fuselage with light blue paint covering the upper part, extending from the nose to the tail. As the camera tilts upward and moves forward, the airplane model quickly exits the bottom of the frame. The camera continues to travel over the stylized airport, which consists of khaki ground, off-white and gray runways, and simple, blocky khaki buildings in the distance. White text appears in the lower-left corner, reading \"9:50 am\" and \"Sarasota Bradenton International Airport,\" as the camera's perspective continues to move along a runway.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a 3D-animated rendering of the Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the camera moves forward along an off-white runway set against a tan-colored landscape. In the distance, simple, blocky beige buildings stand under a light purple and pink sky. The scene begins with a full view of a blue and white airplane before revealing the expansive airport grounds, where a lone figure is visible in the distance. An overlay in the lower-left corner displays white text reading \"9:50 am\" and \"Sarasota Bradenton International Airport.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle shot, showing a large airplane in the foreground, occupying the bottom portion of the frame. Runways and taxiways are visible in the middle ground, extending towards a city skyline of simple buildings in the background at the top of the frame. The camera then tilts up and moves forward, causing the airplane to quickly exit the bottom of the frame. The camera continues to travel forward along a runway that stretches from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground, with the buildings remaining in the background. As the camera advances, a small, lone figure appears in the middle ground, and white text is displayed in the bottom-left corner.",
