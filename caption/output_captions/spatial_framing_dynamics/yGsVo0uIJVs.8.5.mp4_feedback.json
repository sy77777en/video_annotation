    "pre_caption": "This is a full shot of a non-human subject underwater, captured from a high angle. Initially, a long gantry structure spans the top of the frame in the middle ground, with a large piece of wreckage suspended centrally below it, also in the middle ground. A large section of the wreckage then detaches from the center and falls downwards, moving from the middle ground toward the background. As it falls, the camera tilts down and gradually zooms in to track the descending piece, causing the gantry and the remaining wreckage to exit the frame from the top. The shot ends as a full shot of the detached, spider-like fragment, which now occupies the center of the frame in the middle ground as it tumbles downwards. The seabed, previously out of view, enters the frame from the bottom and occupies the background, while small glowing particles drift in the foreground and middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a large, dark, and fragmented metallic structure, resembling a wrecked submarine or underwater vehicle, submerged in deep blue water and illuminated by shafts of light from above. It is tilted to the left beneath a long, gantry-like metal framework that appears to be lifting it upward. The main structure is heavily damaged, with large, jagged sections missing. As the metal frame lifts, some slender, rod-shaped components detach and fall off, causing part of the wreckage to break away and sink. These detached fragments, dark in color, have a central mass with several long, thin, rod-like appendages extending from them, collectively resembling a giant spider as they tumble downward into the darker water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a deep, dark underwater environment, shafts of blue light pierce the water from above, illuminating a long, metallic gantry that extends across the upper part of the scene. Suspended beneath this structure is a large, dark, and fragmented object. As the object disintegrates, several smaller rod-shaped components initially break away from the main structure. Subsequently, a large piece of the wreckage detaches and continues to tumble as it sinks into the darker depths below, accompanied by smaller pieces of debris. Small, glowing particles drift throughout the water. The overlay text \"[2]\" appears in white font on a gray background at the lower-left corner. As the camera moves, the original metal structure exits the frame from the top, while the seabed enters the frame from the bottom.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a full shot of a non-human subject underwater. Midway through the video, some of its parts detach, and the camera gradually zooms in to track one of the falling pieces, ultimately ending with a full shot of the detached part.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
