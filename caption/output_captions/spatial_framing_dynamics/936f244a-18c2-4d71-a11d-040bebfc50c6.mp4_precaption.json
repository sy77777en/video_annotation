    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with light skin and short, light-colored hair is seen from a disorienting, rotating perspective. He is positioned upside down, wearing a red varsity jacket with white sleeves and trim over a white shirt and light-colored pants. His arms are slightly outstretched as he appears to be in a state of falling or floating.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The view spins rapidly, creating a disorienting vortex effect while looking down a brightly lit, stylized indoor shaft. The walls of this geometric structure feature a pattern of alternating red and white vertical stripes. The red sections are marked with a series of dark, circular indentations. Framed in the center by a rectangular opening, a person wearing a red and white jacket is seen within the shaft as the surrounding environment blurs with the fast rotation.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a man is positioned upside down in the center of the frame, viewed through a rectangular opening in the middle ground. The surrounding red and white striped walls of a shaft extend from the foreground into the background. The entire scene rotates rapidly around the central axis, causing the walls to blur into a vortex. Throughout this rotation, the man remains relatively fixed in the center of the frame, while the camera, positioned at his level, spins with the environment.",
