    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An older, light-skinned woman with straight, blonde hair is shown in a dimly lit, cluttered space. She wears a beige knit cardigan and leans forward, knitting with white yarn. Her facial expression is intense, with wide eyes and an open mouth showing her teeth as if she is snarling or shouting. A single lamp with a woven shade illuminates her from the right, casting a warm, focused light on her and the large, light-colored knitted garment she is working on.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a cramped and cluttered closet, illuminated by a single, warm-toned lamp with a woven shade. Clothes hang on racks to the left, while shelves in the background are packed with various items. To the right, a wicker basket contains a green knitted item and a ball of yarn. In the foreground, a large, light-colored cable-knit sweater is spread out, alongside other balls of yarn and a round, dark tin. The focused light creates a spotlight effect, leaving the surrounding areas in deep shadow as an older woman knits in the center of the confined space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static medium shot, an older woman is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground of a cramped space. To her left, clothes hang on racks, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. Directly behind her, the background is filled with cluttered shelves. A lamp is located in the top right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground and angled down toward the woman. To her right in the middle ground is a wicker basket. The foreground is occupied by a large knitted garment at the bottom center, a dark tin at the bottom left, and balls of yarn at the bottom right. The camera is positioned at the woman's level.",
