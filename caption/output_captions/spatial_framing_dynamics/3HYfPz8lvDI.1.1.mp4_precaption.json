    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A fair-skinned man with dark hair is seen relaxing on a white lounge chair next to a swimming pool. He is lying on his back, propped up slightly, and is wearing red swim trunks. He remains still in this reclined position.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a sunny day at a rooftop pool deck next to a large, modern building with a facade of gridded, dark windows. The deck is paved with light-colored stone and features a rectangular swimming pool located in the lower right corner of the frame, with bright blue water. Rows of wooden lounge chairs with white cushions are arranged around the pool, with one brown umbrella providing shade. A person in red shorts is lying on one of the lounge chairs. In the background, green bushes are visible in planters.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot filmed from a high angle, a man in red shorts is positioned in the upper center of the frame, reclining on a lounge chair in the middle ground. A swimming pool occupies the bottom right of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. Rows of empty lounge chairs are arranged throughout the scene, with some in the foreground at the bottom left, many more across the middle ground surrounding the man and the pool, and a few in the background on the far right. A large building with a gridded facade fills the entire background and the top of the frame.",
