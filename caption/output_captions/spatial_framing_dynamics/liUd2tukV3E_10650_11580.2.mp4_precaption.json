    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a large, dimly lit, and hazy room, the main subject is a young boy of East Asian descent who appears to be a toddler. He wears a light-colored, loose-fitting tunic over light-colored pants and has a small, dark cap on his head, with his hair styled in a queue. He walks from left to right, passing a kneeling man in an ornate, patterned robe and a black hat with a red top. The boy stops in the center of the room, illuminated by a strong beam of light, and stands before a person kneeling on the floor on the right side of the frame. The person, wearing a patterned, traditional dress with a red ornament in their dark, styled hair and the same type of hat as the man, looks up at the boy before bowing their head completely to the floor. In the background, numerous silhouetted figures in traditional attire are seated and observing the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a vast, dimly lit hall with dark stone floors and multiple prominent red pillars. The air is thick with a haze that catches dramatic, warm golden beams of light streaming in from an unseen source, creating a strong contrast with the surrounding shadows. Along the walls, rows of indistinct, seated figures are visible in the gloom. A young child wearing a light-colored tunic walks across the floor, while other people in ornate clothing are positioned kneeling in the hazy light and shadows.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed from a high angle, initially shows a young boy in the middle ground on the left, walking past a kneeling man. The boy moves horizontally from left to right across the frame, stopping in the center. He stands before another person who is kneeling in the middle ground on the right. This person then bows down to the floor. In the background, numerous silhouetted figures are seated along the walls. A strong beam of light cuts diagonally from the top right, illuminating the boy and the person on the right, creating depth and separating them from the shadowed foreground and background elements.",
