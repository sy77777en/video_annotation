    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a young woman with dark, shoulder-length hair and bangs, standing in the center of the frame while looking directly upward. She wears a light grey uniform ensemble consisting of a blouse and a matching grey pleated skirt. Her hands are raised above her head as she gazes at the overhead camera. Surrounding her in a circular formation are six other young women with similar dark hairstyles, dressed in identical grey uniforms. These secondary subjects are walking in a clockwise circle around the central figure, focusing their attention on her.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Captured from a bird's-eye view, the scene is set indoors on a floor composed of large, light brown rectangular tiles. Wide, dark gray diagonal bands intersect the tiled surface, creating a geometric pattern. In the center of the space, seven people dressed in light-colored clothing are arranged in a circular formation. The person at the center of the circle looks and reaches up toward the camera, while the other six are positioned around them. The scene is evenly illuminated with diffuse light, resulting in a cool and muted color palette.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured from a high angle, a woman stands in the center of the frame and the middle ground, looking and reaching up toward the camera. Six other women are arranged in a circular formation around her, also occupying the middle ground. The entire scene is set on a tiled floor that fills the frame, serving as the background.",
