    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an architectural scenery shot of a surreal, flooded interior space. The level-angle, above-water-level perspective looks through an arched tunnel, its walls and vaulted ceiling covered in uniform white tiles, toward a larger, hazy, and brightly lit room with curved structures in the distance. The lower half of the scene is filled with rippling, murky green water, creating a stark contrast with the sterile white tiles. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the unsettling and dreamlike atmosphere of the liminal space. The immersive viewpoint is used to emphasize the environment itself rather than directing attention to a particular object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A level-angle perspective from the surface of murky, greenish water shows a static view through an arched tunnel. The walls and curved ceiling of the tunnel are uniformly covered in a grid of small, off-white square tiles. The tunnel opens into a larger, brightly lit area in the distance, noted for its curved structures with more architectural texture, including smooth white columns and walls, in addition to the tiles. This space features a simple metal railing, and the ceiling is illuminated by several rectangular light fixtures. The water has gentle ripples that reflect the diffuse, artificial light of the enclosed space.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of architectural scenery with no main subjects. The camera is positioned at a level angle, just above the surface of murky green water that fills the bottom half of the frame from the foreground into the middle ground. The view is framed by an arched tunnel, with its tiled walls occupying the left and right sides of the frame and receding toward the center. In the background, the tunnel's opening reveals a larger, brightly lit, and hazy room containing curved white structures and a railing. The static, low-perspective viewpoint looks straight through the tunnel into the distant room.",
