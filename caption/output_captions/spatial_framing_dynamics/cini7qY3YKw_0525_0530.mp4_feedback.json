    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot, beginning with a split-level view from the water's surface. The sky and a distant horizon occupy the top background of the frame, with a shoreline visible on the far left. The clear water and sandy seabed fill the bottom foreground and middle ground. The camera then submerges, transitioning the view to a fully underwater, high-angle wide shot. In this final framing, the camera is positioned just below the surface, looking down as the sandy seabed fills the entire frame from foreground to middle ground, with shifting patterns of sunlight cast across it from above. The camera continues to drift slowly forward over the ocean floor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a waterscape scenery shot that captures the serene beauty of a clear, shallow ocean. The video begins with a view just at the water's surface, showing the calm sea stretching to the horizon under a bright blue sky, before submerging to reveal the underwater world. Below the surface, the sandy seabed is brilliantly illuminated by sunlight, which creates a mesmerizing, shifting pattern of bright, web-like lines across the bottom. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is entirely on the tranquil atmosphere of the underwater environment, highlighting the exceptional clarity of the water and the beautiful play of light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From the surface of a calm body of water on a sunny day, a distant, tree-lined shore is visible under a clear blue sky, with soft, misty blurs at the edges of the frame likely caused by water droplets on the camera lens. The perspective then submerges into the transparent water, revealing a sandy bottom with larger rocks and pebbles visible indistinctly. A faint greenish layer appears near the top of the frame as bright sunlight filters through the surface, casting a shifting network of rippling light patterns across the sand below.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
