    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a detailed model of an airplane, identifiable as Air Force One, a Boeing 747. The aircraft is primarily white with a light blue stripe running horizontally along its fuselage. The tail fin is white with blue decorations, featuring the American flag, while the seal is displayed on the side of the plane. Initially, the main plane is shown from a top-down, slightly angled perspective, revealing its four engines and the characteristic hump on the upper deck. Later, the camera cranes down to show the plane in profile. Scattered around this main, sharply focused plane are several smaller, all-white airplanes. These secondary planes are less detailed, appear out of focus, and are positioned at various distances and orientations against the black background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid black background, a model of Air Force One is initially featured centrally but later shifts to the upper center due to camera movement. The aircraft, a white and light blue Boeing 747, is shown from above initially, later shown in profile as the camera cranes down, revealing the text \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" on its side and an American flag on its tail. Scattered around the main plane are numerous smaller, out-of-focus, all-white airplane shapes that drift across the dark expanse.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Cannot decide the relative height due to lack of background information.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a model of Air Force One is initially positioned in the center of the frame in the middle ground, viewed from a top-down, slightly angled perspective. Several smaller, out-of-focus white airplane models are scattered in the background and foreground, with some visible in the top left and bottom right. As the camera pans slightly to the right and cranes down, the main airplane shifts to the upper center of the frame, and the perspective changes to a side profile view. Throughout the shot, the smaller planes drift across the frame in various directions.",
