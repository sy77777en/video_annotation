    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of people gathered on the uppermost, string-lit deck of a likely multi-story white boat at night, with a flag visible on a pole, resembling an American flag. A man with dark hair, wearing a dark jacket and brown trousers, appears in the foreground on a dock, walking from left to right with a slight hunch. Later in the video, another man dressed in a dark suit is revealed walking in the same direction along the lower, illuminated deck of the boat in the midground. The first man in the foreground eventually jumps down to a lower level and out of view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a large, white, multi-story vessel is moored at a dark dock, with only the top two decks visible. The open upper deck is illuminated by strings of warm, round light bulbs, with a flag visible, rolled up to a pole at the stern where people are gathered, resembling an American flag. The foreground is obscured by the dark silhouettes of equipment and crates on the dock, where a man in a dark jacket walks past. Another man in a suit is seen walking along the boat's lower, enclosed deck. In the far background, the dark sky is dotted with the soft, out-of-focus lights of a distant shoreline.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The scene opens with a group gathered at the bow of a two-story boat. From the shore, the two-story white hull nearly fills the frame. As it moves right, a man enters from the left with a medium shot and walks along the shore. The shot shifts to a full-body shot before he disappears into the darkness. Meanwhile, another man in black appears on the boat\u2019s first floor, moving left to right. The sequence ends with a wide shot of the second man.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is at the same height as the first man, but slightly higher than the second man.",
    "pre_caption": "The scene opens with a wide shot where the two-story white hull of a boat in the middle ground nearly fills the frame, with a group of people gathered on its illuminated top deck in the upper half of the frame. The bottom of the frame is occupied by dark, silhouetted objects in the foreground. A man enters the left foreground in a medium shot that becomes a full-body shot as he walks from left to right across the lower frame, in front of the boat. Simultaneously, a second man appears in the middle ground, walking from left to right along the boat's lower deck, positioned centrally below the upper deck party. The first man in the foreground then moves down and out of the bottom of the frame, while the shot ends on a wide view of the second man continuing his walk on the boat. The camera is positioned at the same height as the first man in the foreground, placing it slightly above the second man on the boat's lower deck.",
