    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark, blurred silhouette of a person, seen from behind, occupies the foreground. This human figure wears a bulky, dark-colored jacket or hoodie. The other subject is a small, dark quadcopter drone, which is initially on the ground before it takes off and flies. The drone is characterized by its glowing red and green navigation lights, which are clearly visible against the dim sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a vast, grassy field at dusk, with a line of trees visible on the distant horizon under a darkening sky that holds a faint glow. A person, seen only as a dark silhouette from behind, stands in the foreground. A quadcopter drone, distinguished by its flashing red and green lights, lifts off from the ground and ascends into the twilight sky.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of a drone, with a blurred human figure in the foreground shown in a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a person's silhouette in the foreground, occupying the left and central parts of the frame. In the middle ground, a drone with glowing lights is positioned on the ground at the bottom center-right, with a field extending into the background and a treeline on the horizon at the top of the frame. The camera is initially positioned above the person. The drone then ascends from the ground, moving upward into the upper center-right of the frame. As the drone continues to fly higher into the upper-center, the person's silhouette shifts to the bottom-left of the frame, and the camera tilts upward to follow the drone's movement, changing its position to be below the airborne subject.",
