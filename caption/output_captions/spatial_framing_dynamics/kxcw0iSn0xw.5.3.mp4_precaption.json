    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with reddish-blond hair in a mullet style is shown in the middle of swinging a baseball bat. He is wearing a red baseball cap backward, a light green t-shirt, and dark shorts, and he holds a black and yellow bat with both hands. A bright green, smooth, spherical ball is seen just before impact, and then deforming dramatically as it hits the bat, stretching and wrapping around the barrel like a viscous liquid. A partial view of the man's back and arm is visible on the right side of the screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors during the day on a paved driveway in a suburban area. In the background, a house with a brick lower level and dark siding on the upper level is partially visible, surrounded by green trees and shrubs under a clear sky. A person is captured mid-swing with a black and yellow baseball bat. A bright green, spherical object, which appears to be made of a viscous, slime-like material, makes contact with the bat. Upon impact, the green object deforms, flattens, and wraps around the bat's barrel, stretching and dripping. The video is presented with an overlay that creates a triptych-style frame; the central panel shows the main, clear action, while the two side panels display blurred and cropped views of the same scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot presented with a triptych-style frame, a man is positioned in the center of the clear, central panel, occupying the middle ground. The two side panels display blurred and cropped views of the scene, with the right panel showing the man's back and the left panel showing the background. A green ball travels from the left side of the central panel toward the center, moving through the middle ground before colliding with the bat held by the man. Upon impact, the green substance deforms and wraps around the bat, remaining in the center of the frame. A house and trees are visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
