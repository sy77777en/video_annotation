    "pre_caption": "The video uses a close-up shot, with the camera positioned above the subjects, looking down at the top of the air conditioning unit. The circular metal grille of the unit occupies most of the frame, centered and spanning from the foreground to the middle ground. The blue balloon is placed on the right side of the grille, positioned in the middle ground and toward the right of the frame. In the upper left corner, an adult\u2019s forearm and hand, holding a knife, enter from the top left and remain in the foreground. The knife moves diagonally from the top left toward the center-right, puncturing the balloon. As the balloon bursts, water expands outward, briefly filling the center and right side of the frame in the middle ground, with droplets scattering across the grille and into the air, reaching both the foreground and background. The green grass is visible in the background, mainly in the top right and top left corners. Throughout the video, the camera remains stationary above the scene, and the main spatial changes are the movement of the hand and knife toward the balloon, the expansion of water across the grille, and the dispersal of droplets outward from the center-right to the edges of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures an outdoor air conditioner unit with a circular metal protective mesh cover, featuring a concentric arc-shaped grid structure. Inside the mesh, dark-colored components and yellow-blue wires are visible. A blue balloon is placed on the right side of the mesh cover. In the upper left corner, an adult's forearm and hand, with light-colored skin and a light blue silicone wristband, hold a silver-gray metal knife with a dark handle. The video uses speed ramping for dramatic effect. Initially, in real time, the hand with the knife approaches the blue balloon on the metal grille of the outdoor fan unit. As the knife punctures the balloon, the footage transitions to slow motion, capturing the water as it bursts out and briefly retains a rounded, balloon-like shape. The action resumes normal speed as the knife retracts. Shortly after, the water collapses onto the spinning fan below, and the video again shifts to slow motion, highlighting the fan-driven splash as droplets scatter across the grille and into the air.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors on a sunny day, showing the top of a large, metallic air conditioning unit with a circular, white metal grille. A bright blue balloon with a smooth, shiny surface rests on the grille, contrasting with the metallic texture and neutral color of the unit. The scene includes a moment where the balloon bursts, releasing a spray of water droplets that scatter across the grille and surrounding area, creating a dynamic effect. In the background, a patch of green grass is visible, adding a natural element to the otherwise industrial setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
