    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases a vast and desolate polar landscape, emphasizing the immense scale and stark atmosphere of the icy environment. A massive, jagged iceberg with distinct, stepped layers dominates the foreground, its form cast in a cool, blue-white shadow. Beyond this icy giant, the dark, calm water is interrupted by a brilliant patch of reflected sunlight, upon which the tiny, dark silhouette of a lone boat is visible. In the far distance, a range of snow-covered mountains is partially obscured by low-hanging clouds and mist, enhancing the sense of isolation and grandeur. The setting could be either the Arctic or Antarctic, as both regions share these dramatic features.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a vast, polar landscape. In the foreground, a large, angular iceberg with visible layers rises from the dark, calm water. In the distance, a bright reflection of the sun shines on the water's surface, silhouetting a small boat. Beyond the water, a snow-covered, mountainous coastline is partially obscured by low-hanging clouds and fog under a dim sky. The scene is characterized by a cool, blue and grey color palette.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a polar landscape. A large iceberg is positioned in the foreground, occupying the bottom right and extending towards the center of the frame. The dark water of the sea is in the middle ground, surrounding the iceberg and filling the rest of the frame up to the background. A small boat is visible as a silhouette in the middle ground, located in the upper center-left of the frame within a bright patch of reflected sunlight on the water. In the background, a range of snow-covered mountains stretches across the top of the frame. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down on the entire scene, and remains static throughout the shot.",
