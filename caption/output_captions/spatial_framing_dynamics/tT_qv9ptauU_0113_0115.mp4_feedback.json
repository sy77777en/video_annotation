    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a close-up focused on a man positioned in the right foreground. A second man is visible in the left foreground, with a dark wooden banister separating them in the immediate foreground. Through a central doorway in the middle ground, several out-of-focus people are visible in the background. The shot then transitions by shifting focus to the man on the left, reframing him in a close-up while the man on the right becomes an out-of-focus element in the right foreground. Throughout this sequence, the camera remains at the subjects' eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows two men in a close-up conversation. On the right, a man with a fair complexion, dark, short, curly hair, and a clean-shaven face wears a red polo shirt. He is shown in profile, facing left. On the left, a man with a fair complexion, shaggy, wavy blond hair, and a clean-shaven face wears a dark blue collared shirt. He faces the other man. In the background, visible through a doorway, a blonde woman in a pink top is standing, and two women can be faintly seen sitting on a sofa. A man in a yellow sweater and light-colored pants stands near another man in a dark blazer.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene takes place in a well-lit residence, characterized by classic architectural details like white fluted columns in the middle ground and a dark wooden staircase banister in the foreground. Through a wide doorway, a brightly lit background room is visible, where several out-of-focus figures are gathered and a patterned armchair is situated. Two men stand on opposite sides of the staircase in the foreground. The video includes overlay elements: the text \"Wedding Crashers\" is displayed in white in the top left corner, and a white circular icon containing a bird head symbol is located in the top right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
