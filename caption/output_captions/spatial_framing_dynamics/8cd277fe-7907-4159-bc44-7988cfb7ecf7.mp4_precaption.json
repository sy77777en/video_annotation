    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, straight, dark hair and light skin is the central subject, viewed from directly overhead. She is wearing a white, pinstriped jacket with several black bands on the sleeve of her right arm. Initially, she looks directly up towards the camera, but by the end, she slightly lowers her head and shifts her gaze downward. Her right arm is raised, with her index finger extended, and her hand moves in a circular motion. Surrounding her are several other figures, all dressed in dark, solid-colored clothing, some of whom are wearing hats. These surrounding figures are positioned in a circle around the central woman.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, indoor environment where the floor features a white, tile-like design with square panels that glow from within. Figures dressed in black are standing on the floor, while a central figure in a white pinstriped outfit is also present. The camera rotates clockwise around the scene, and small, bright, circular light flares are visible across the composition.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured from a high-angle, overhead perspective, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. She is encircled by several other figures in dark clothing who are arranged around her, also in the middle ground, on a floor made of glowing square panels. The entire scene, including all subjects, rotates clockwise as a single unit due to the camera's movement.",
