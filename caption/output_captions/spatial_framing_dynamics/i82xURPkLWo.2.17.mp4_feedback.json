    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot, two men are initially positioned in the center middle ground, embracing. A large tree trunk and a wooden rack of firewood occupy the left foreground, partially obscuring a dark truck in the left middle ground. In the background, a prominent palm tree is centered among a forest of other trees. The men release their hug, turn, and walk away from the camera, moving from the middle ground toward the background along a dirt path. As they walk, the man in the blazer is on the left, and the man in the t-shirt is on the right. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two men are seen in a grassy, wooded area. One man is bald with a light skin tone and is wearing a blue blazer, a light-colored collared shirt, grey trousers, and dark shoes. The other man has a muscular build, a darker skin tone, and short dark hair. He is wearing a pinkish-red t-shirt, dark jeans, and dark shoes, with a dark object that appears to be a handgun tucked into the back of his waistband. The two men share a hug before turning and walking away from the camera together, with the man in the blazer on the left and the man in the t-shirt on the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor scene takes place during the day in a grassy clearing surrounded by a forest of tall pine trees and a prominent palm tree. In the foreground, a wooden rack is stacked with chopped firewood next to the front of a dark-colored truck. A dirt path winds through the grass, and a small wooden structure is visible in the background among the trees. Two men are present in the clearing; they embrace and then walk away from the camera.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
