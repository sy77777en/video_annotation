    "pre_caption": "The shot begins with the camera above the water's surface before it submerges, settling on a medium shot that frames a woman from the chest up. The woman is positioned in the bottom-left quadrant of the frame and occupies the middle ground. In the foreground, a large camera held by an operator is visible on the right side, pointed directly at the woman. A third person is partially visible in the background, positioned centrally between the other two subjects. The primary vertical movement in the scene is the woman's hair, which floats directly upwards toward the top of the frame as bubbles rise from it. The camera filming the entire scene is positioned at the woman's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Underwater, a young woman with a light complexion and long, dark hair floats serenely. She wears a dark, sleeveless top and initially appears in the video from the chest up, then transitions to only her head being visible, before returning to the chest-up view. She gazes towards a large, black professional camera pointed at her, held by a person whose hands and part of their dark-colored shirt are visible. In the background, another person is partially and indistinctly seen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a view above the water's surface before swiftly transitioning to an underwater scene set in a body of hazy, greenish-blue water. A person with dark hair is submerged, and their hair floats directly upwards, releasing small air bubbles that rise toward the surface. Positioned in front of the person is a large, dark-colored professional camera, also underwater, capturing the scene. The water is illuminated, creating a soft, diffused light throughout the environment.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera starts above the water\u2019s surface and then moves underwater, showing a girl beneath the water, with only her chest up body visible. In the scene, there is a photographer underwater holding a camera and filming her, with another person swimming nearby.\n\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
