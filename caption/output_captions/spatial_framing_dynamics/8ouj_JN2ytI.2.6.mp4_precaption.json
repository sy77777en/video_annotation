    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of spectators, mostly white men and women, are gathered in stadium seating, leaning against a metal railing with tense expressions. A man with short blond hair, wearing a black jacket, a gold chain, and blue jeans, stands with his hands on the railing, looking forward seriously. To his left, a man in a black jacket and blue jeans leans forward heavily on the railing, looking intently ahead. Behind him, another man in a striped black and grey shirt stands behind a man wearing a black jacket over a yellow t-shirt, all with focused gazes. To the right and slightly behind the blond man, a man in a black jacket and a woman with red hair, who has her hand to her head, both have concerned expressions. In the lower portion of the frame, a man with dark hair in a black hooded jacket is holding the railing with his arm. Additionally, there are more individuals with yellow hair or wearing yellow-fur hats peering through the bars of the railing. The crowd is dressed predominantly in black and yellow clothing, with some individuals wearing yellow headbands or holding yellow cloths.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a large, crowded outdoor stadium during the day, a group of spectators stands in the stands, looking intently forward. The crowd, dressed predominantly in black and yellow clothing, is positioned behind a gray metal grid railing, over which black and yellow banners are draped. Yellow stadium seats are visible behind them, and the upper deck of the stadium, also filled with people, can be seen in the background. The camera trucks to the right, revealing more of the crowd.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium full shot of a group of spectators in a stadium, captured from their level. Initially, the main group of spectators occupies the center and left of the frame in the middle ground, leaning against a metal railing that runs across the foreground. A black banner is draped over the railing in the bottom left foreground. Behind the group, yellow stadium seats are visible in the middle ground, with the upper deck of the stadium filling the background at the top of the frame. The camera then trucks horizontally to the right, causing the initial group to shift towards the left side of the frame. This movement reveals more of the crowd on the right, who are also positioned in the middle ground behind the foreground railing.",
