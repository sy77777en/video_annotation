    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man with short, blond hair, seen from an over-the-shoulder perspective. He is wearing a brown leather jacket with a light-colored shearling collar over a dark shirt and dark pants. He is initially seen standing before raising a silver handgun to aim. As he moves forward, several other men appear. One man, wearing a cap, a light-colored long-sleeved shirt, and dark pants, is initially standing with his back to the main character, after which he is shot, falls to the ground, and is kicked once by the main character. Another man with a beard, wearing a reddish vest over a shirt, stands near a large bonfire holding an axe. A third man with a dark beard and dark, simple clothing approaches the main character from near the fire. Other men in similar rustic clothing are visible in the scene, standing at a distance, while another figure is being burned on the bonfire.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot framing the character from the hip up follows a man in a brown leather jacket as he moves through a gloomy, fog-filled rural village at night. The scene is set outdoors on muddy, uneven ground between old, dilapidated houses constructed from rough, uneven stone with tiled and corrugated metal roofs. A large, raging bonfire in the center of the village serves as the primary light source, illuminating the dark surroundings and revealing a figure tied to a post within the flames. The area is cluttered with barrels, crates, and loose wooden planks. The perspective shifts as the character draws a handgun and advances from behind a stone trough toward the fire, where other figures, some armed with axes, are moving about. An overlay of white text appears at the bottom of the screen, displaying the subtitle \"Here we go.\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a 3D game video. The camera follows the character\u2019s movements from behind. The character is shown in a medium shot initially, but the shot shifts between close-up, medium, and full shots as the camera zooms in and out. As the character moves, multiple NPCs appear, fully visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium over-the-shoulder shot, placing the main character in the center-left foreground, with stone houses in the left and center background. In the middle ground, a man stands in the center, while a large bonfire and another man with an axe are positioned on the right. The camera follows the main character forward, tightening to a close-up over his shoulder as he aims at the central man, who then falls in the center middle ground. As the main character advances and turns, the camera pans right, positioning the bonfire on the right side of the frame and revealing other men approaching from the center and left middle ground. The character then moves to the left of the bonfire, causing the camera to pan right and track with him, keeping him in the center-left as a building appears in the center background. Throughout the action, the camera remains at the subject's level, while the shot size dynamically shifts between close-up, medium, and full shots to accommodate the character's movements and aiming.",
