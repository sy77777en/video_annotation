    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with short, dark hair is seen from behind, sitting in the driver's seat of a car. The individual is wearing a light-colored t-shirt and is silhouetted against the bright view through the windshield. Their head and shoulders are visible above the headrest as they operate the vehicle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures the scene ahead from inside a car as it drives through a dark tunnel during the daytime. The car's interior is in deep shadow, with the silhouette of the driver visible behind the steering wheel. Through the front windshield, the road leads toward the bright, rectangular opening at the end of the tunnel. As the vehicle moves forward, the light from the exit grows larger and begins to illuminate the dashboard and rearview mirror. The entire scene is presented with a natural grainy texture characteristic of the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, the silhouetted driver is positioned in the bottom-left and center foreground, with their head and shoulders visible. The car's interior, including the dashboard, occupies the lower foreground, while the rearview mirror is at the top-center. In the center background, the bright exit of a tunnel is visible through the windshield. As the car moves forward, the tunnel exit grows larger and brighter in the frame, causing the light to gradually illuminate the foreground elements. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level from a perspective behind the driver.",
