    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, a right hand wearing a blue glove with a white circular logo on the back appears above the clear ocean water, with the index finger pointing forward. The hand exits the frame before the view transitions to an underwater scene, revealing a rocky and uneven ocean floor. The seabed is covered with dense patches of green and brown algae and seaweed. Sunlight filters through the clear water from the surface above. Towards the end of the video, the left hand, also gloved, partially enters the view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a scene in the shallow, clear waters of an ocean on a sunny day. Initially, a blue-gloved hand with a white circular logo points forward over the rippling surface of the water, with a vast blue sky and horizon in the distance. The perspective then submerges, transitioning to an underwater view where sunlight filters through the water to illuminate a rocky seabed covered in patches of green and brown algae.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the video begins with a blue-gloved right hand in the bottom-center foreground, pointing forward over the ocean surface which occupies the lower half of the frame in the middle ground. The sky and distant horizon fill the top half of the frame in the background. The hand moves down and exits the bottom of the frame as the camera's viewpoint lowers to the water's surface and then submerges. The scene transitions to an underwater perspective where the rocky, algae-covered seabed fills the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. The camera moves forward just above the seabed, and a second gloved hand partially enters the frame from the bottom left foreground.",
