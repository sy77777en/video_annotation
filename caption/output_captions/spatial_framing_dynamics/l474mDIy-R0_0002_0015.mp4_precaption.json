    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person skydiving, wearing a black and white jumpsuit and a red helmet. They are seen from a distance in a horizontal, belly-to-earth freefall position with their arms and legs spread. Later, a second person appears in a close-up view in the lower-right corner of the scene. This second individual is seen from a first-person perspective, showing the top of their helmet, which is primarily black and white with green and red color blocks, and their right shoulder, which is covered in a suit with red, white, and blue sections. Throughout this, the first skydiver remains visible in the distance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person perspective, the scene captures a skydive high above a dense blanket of white clouds under a clear blue sky during the day. The sun shines brightly, casting a golden glow across the cloud tops. A skydiver, wearing a black and white suit with a red helmet, is seen free-falling before plunging into the thick cloud layer. The view follows into the disorienting white fog of the cloud's interior. The black-and-white patterned helmet of the person filming, featuring red color blocks, becomes visible in the foreground while still within the clouds. After a moment, the perspective emerges below the cloud cover, revealing the distant ground, which features a landscape of fields and a winding river.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video initially shows a wide shot of a person in midair. In the lower-right corner, a close-up of another person appears, while still showing the wide shot of the person who was flying.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera starts above the main subject, then moves below, but maintains the same height as the subject in the lower-right corner.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a wide shot of a skydiver positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground above a background of clouds. As the camera follows the subject's descent, the skydiver moves away from the camera and into the cloud layer, remaining centrally framed. While inside the cloud, a close-up of a second person's helmet enters the frame from the bottom right, occupying the foreground. The first skydiver remains visible in the middle ground, now shifted to the center-left of the frame. The scene concludes as they emerge from the clouds, with the first skydiver in the middle ground, the second person's helmet in the foreground at the bottom right, the ground in the deep background below, and the cloud layer in the background above. The camera starts above the first skydiver and then moves to a position below them, while consistently maintaining the height of the second person in the foreground.",
