    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black stick figure with a round head, thin limbs, and large, blocky feet is depicted with its hands on its hips. The figure's face is shown as a plain black circle, and when it opens its mouth to speak, a triangular gap appears on its round head. On the ground near the figure is a small, rectangular, orange object with a grid of black dots on its surface, resembling a small electronic device.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a minimalist, 2D animated scene with a white background, a single black horizontal line represents the ground. Small, sketchy green lines resembling blades of grass are scattered along this ground line. A black stick figure walks consistently from left to right, staying centered in the frame. The figure pauses, bends down, and picks up an orange rectangular object from the ground, holding it to his ear. As his black hand partially covers the rectangle, an orange jagged symbol appears on his head.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a full shot featuring a black stick figure in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. A black horizontal line representing the ground extends across the bottom of the frame, with green scribbles for grass scattered along it, all on the same middle-ground plane. The figure walks from left to right, remaining centered in the frame as the scene scrolls. An orange rectangular object enters from the bottom right and settles on the ground line in the middle ground. The figure stops in the center, bends down to the object, and then stands up, holding the object to the side of its head. The camera remains at the subject's height throughout the video.",
