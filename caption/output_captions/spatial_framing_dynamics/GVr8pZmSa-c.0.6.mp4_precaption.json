    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, dark shipwreck is shown resting on the seabed in deep, dark blue water. The vessel, which appears to be a section of a larger ship, is metallic and has a blocky, somewhat curved structure. It is tilted at an angle, with one side partially settled into the sandy or silty ocean floor. A ladder-like structure runs along the upper right edge of the wreck, and a long, thin piece of metal juts out from the left side. Small, bright particles, possibly marine snow or bubbles, float in the water surrounding the submerged structure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set deep underwater, showing a large, dark section of a shipwreck resting on the murky seabed. The water is a deep, dark blue, filled with floating particulate matter. The wreck, which appears to be made of metal, has a curved structure with a ladder running along its side and a thin pole extending from one end. The vessel is dimly illuminated from an unseen source, making it stand out against the surrounding darkness. At the end of the video, an overlay appears in the lower-left corner, displaying a brownish-yellow rectangle with the black number \"1901\" inside.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "A full shot captures a large section of a shipwreck resting in the middle ground, positioned centrally within the frame. The wreck is angled, with its left side extending toward the bottom-left foreground and its right side curving away into the middle ground. The seabed occupies the bottom of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the middle ground beneath the wreck. The deep blue water fills the surrounding space and the background. The camera maintains a static, high-angle position, looking down on the scene. Towards the end of the clip, a rectangular overlay with the number \"1901\" appears in the bottom-left corner of the frame.",
