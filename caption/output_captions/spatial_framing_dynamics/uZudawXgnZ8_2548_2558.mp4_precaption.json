    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel art scene, a man with white hair, a white mustache, and fair skin stands in a small, tilled garden plot. He wears a red long-sleeved shirt and blue pants. The garden contains several rows of small green sprouts. The surrounding area is largely undeveloped, featuring a wooden farmhouse with a red roof and numerous green pine and deciduous trees of varying sizes. Among the green foliage, a single large tree on the right is distinguished by its full canopy of bright purple and pink blossoms. The ground is scattered with gray stones, logs, and patches of weeds.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides. The scene is set in a vibrant, pixel-art style rural landscape during the morning. In the upper portion of the scene stands a wooden farmhouse with a red roof, situated on a continuous, irregular area of green grass. Below the farmhouse is a large, uncleared area of sandy dirt, rocks, stumps, and weeds, with a single tree and a small, tilled garden plot visible in this area. Surrounding the sandy area is a green grass area filled with green pine and deciduous trees, rocks, stumps, and weeds. A prominent tree with purple blossoms stands on the right. A character with white hair and a red shirt is in the small, tilled garden plot, watering green sprouts. Overlays are present on the screen: in the top right corner, a display shows the date as Tue. 2, the time advancing from 7:10 AM to 7:20 AM, a sun icon for weather, and the number 70 displayed above an exclamation mark. At the bottom, a toolbar displays icons for an axe, pickaxe, scythe, hoe, watering can, and a dirt or rocks icon. Additionally, there is another column-shaped overlay with the letter \"E\" in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot presents a 2D, top-down view of a rural scene. In the top-center background, a wooden farmhouse is visible. A character is positioned in the center-right of the frame, located within a small, tilled garden plot in the middle ground. This plot is part of a larger, sandy, undeveloped area that occupies the center of the scene. This central area is surrounded by green grass and numerous trees, with a large cluster on the left side of the frame and a distinct purple-blossomed tree in the middle ground on the far right. The character moves from the left side of the garden plot to the right and then upward, remaining within the plot's boundaries. The camera remains static, with UI elements fixed in the top-right corner and along the bottom of the frame.",
