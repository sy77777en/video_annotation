    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a light complexion, short dark hair, and a beard is shown in a tilted orientation, sitting amidst tall, dry grass. He is wearing a dark, hooded shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and dark pants. He sits with his knees bent, his arms crossed over his shins, and his hands clasped together. He looks directly towards the camera.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in a field of tall, dry, golden-brown grass, with the entire perspective rotated 90 degrees. In the soft-focus background, green trees stand against a bright, washed-out sky. A person wearing a dark, hooded shirt and jeans is positioned sitting within the grass. The atmosphere has a subtle, shimmering quality, creating a slight distortion throughout the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static, rotated full shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame, situated in the middle ground. He is surrounded by tall, dry grass that occupies the left portion of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. On the right side of the frame, out-of-focus trees and a bright sky form the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the spatial composition remains unchanged throughout the video.",
