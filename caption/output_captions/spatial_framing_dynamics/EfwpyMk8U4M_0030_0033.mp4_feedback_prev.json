    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide shot of a young boy standing in the center of the frame in the middle ground, on a paved road that stretches from the foreground into the background. A white house occupies the right middle ground, with trees in the background and along the sides of the frame. The camera is initially positioned at a high angle, looking down at the boy. As the boy runs from the middle ground toward the foreground, the camera pedestals down, transitioning the shot into a full shot and lowering the camera to the boy's eye level. Throughout the clip, the boy remains in the center of the frame, and a text box is visible in the bottom center foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned boy with short, dark hair stands in the middle of a paved road. He is wearing a black short-sleeved t-shirt with a yellow graphic on the chest and a pair of red shorts. He initially stands still, looking toward the camera, before beginning to run forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds on a paved road in a sunny residential neighborhood, surrounded by lush green trees and bushes. A two-story white house stands prominently on the right, with another house visible in the distance. A young boy in a black t-shirt and red shorts runs towards the camera. Overhead, power lines stretch across the clear sky. At the bottom of the screen, a white text box with black text smoothly fades in and increases in size, displaying: \"Pedestal is when you move the camera vertically up or down while it is fixated in one location.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
