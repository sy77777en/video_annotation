    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot focused on a futuristic cityscape. The video opens with a high-angle, top-down view centered on the peak of a skyscraper, which occupies the middle ground. The camera then performs a smooth, continuous movement, simultaneously pulling back, descending, and arcing clockwise around the tower while tilting upward. This motion reveals the full structure of the central skyscraper, which remains in the center of the frame but transitions to the middle ground from a greater distance. Surrounding the tower, a cityscape of smaller buildings, a network of highways, and a winding body of water occupy the middle ground. As the camera pulls back, a vast desert landscape appears in the background, stretching to the horizon, while the cloudy sky fills the upper portion of the frame. A static text overlay is present in the top right corner throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a futuristic cityscape scenery shot, captured from an aerial perspective that pulls back to reveal the immense scale of the environment. The shot centers on a towering skyscraper with a unique, teardrop-shaped arch at its peak. Within this arch sits a luxurious rooftop terrace complete with a pool, lounge chairs, and palm trees. The building's facade is a sleek combination of glass and vertical fins, wrapping around tiered, curved floors. This architectural marvel is situated in a sprawling, modern city that extends into a vast desert landscape, interwoven with a complex network of highways and a winding waterway. The entire scene is bathed in the soft, warm glow of sunrise or sunset under a partly cloudy sky. The focus is on the grandeur of the architectural design and its integration into the vast, futuristic setting, making the overall atmosphere and scale the true subject rather than any single element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a unique, teardrop-shaped skyscraper, performing a smooth, clockwise arc while descending and tilting upward, before eventually pulling back to reveal its full form against a sunset sky. The building features a glass and metal facade with vertical lines and culminates in a large open arch at its peak. Within this arch, a rooftop terrace is visible, featuring a circular pool, lounge chairs, and palm trees. The skyscraper is situated in a modern city grid with numerous white, block-like buildings, intersected by highways and a winding body of water. The surrounding landscape is flat and desert-like under a sky filled with soft clouds and tinged with pink and orange hues. An overlay in the top right corner displays the text \"Animations are for illustrative purposes only. The final building may differ.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
