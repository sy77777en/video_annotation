    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a fantasy-industrial castle where medieval stone architecture seamlessly integrates with a vibrant network of brightly colored pipes and metal frameworks, creating the impression of a structure in the midst of transformation. The camera initially focuses on stone towers and brick walls, featuring large arched windows and crenellated battlements that evoke a fortress-like appearance. Overhead, curved metal frameworks resembling partial glass canopies or greenhouse roofs span the courtyard area. As the camera sweeps across the scene, more mechanical and industrial elements are revealed. Brightly colored pipes in red, yellow, purple, teal, and green run both horizontally and vertically across the walls. Some pipes form industrial-looking cylindrical structures, while others extend along the outer walls. This dynamic interplay of elements suggests a gradual renovation, blending historical architecture with vibrant, industrial fantasy elements to establish a unique and wondrous atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds within a dynamic, open-air industrial structure crafted from old stone and brick, featuring castle-like turrets and large arched windows. A vast, curved glass roof partially covers the building, while the environment evolves through a continuous, self-sustaining construction process. This space beautifully blends elements of fantasy with industrial design, dominated by a complex network of large, brightly colored pipes in shades of red, yellow, purple, and green that weave along the walls. In the background, a tall, spiraling tower with a red and white candy-cane pattern adds to the whimsical atmosphere. The foreground is filled with various pieces of steampunk-style machinery, including wheels, gears, and copper-colored vats. The sun is low in the sky, casting a bright, hazy glare over the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide, low-angle scenery shot of a fantasy-industrial structure. Initially, the frame shows a stone tower on the left and another on the right, both in the middle ground, connected by a large red pipe running horizontally across the center. A glass roof is visible in the background at the top of the frame, with various machinery in the foreground at the bottom. The camera then pans from right to left while tilting slightly upward. This movement reveals a tall, red-and-white spiraling tower in the background, moving it toward the center of the frame, and brings a complex network of colorful pipes into view in the middle ground on the left.",
