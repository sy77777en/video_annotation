    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, a small, glowing creature is initially positioned on a rock ledge on the right side of the frame, in the middle ground. A large, spiky log bridge spans the center of the frame, also in the middle ground, connecting rock formations on the left and right. The creature jumps from the right ledge, moving left across the center of the frame and under the spiky bridge. It then performs a mid-air dash, propelling itself further left to land on the vertical face of the left-side rock formation. The camera, positioned at the subject's height to capture the scene in profile, pans slightly to the left to follow the creature's movement. A bright blue crystal is visible in the upper right background, and HUD elements are overlaid in the top-left and bottom-center foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, white, glowing creature with a quadrupedal form, long pointed ears, and a slender tail is present in a dark environment. This creature emits a soft white light from its body. Also visible are large, dark, log-like structures covered entirely in sharp, crystalline spikes, which are suspended horizontally in the air. In the scene, there are clusters of small, glowing blue mushrooms attached to rock surfaces and a small, floating orb of blue light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene or character in profile, the setting is a dark, cavernous environment at night. The landscape is composed of jagged, dark rock formations that create ledges and vertical walls. A hazardous, spiky, log-like bridge spans a gap between two rock pillars. The scene is illuminated by bioluminescent elements, including clusters of small, glowing blue mushrooms on the rock surfaces, patches of golden flora, and a prominent, bright blue crystalline structure in the upper right background. The deep blue and purple background suggests a vast, dark forest or cave system. A small, white, glowing creature navigates the treacherous terrain by jumping between platforms. Overlay elements are visible on screen: a yellow circular icon with the number \"1\" is in the top-left corner, and a heads-up display with a circular meter and green leaf-like icons is at the bottom-center.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
