    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, four transparent rectangular panels are arranged in a staggered line from left to right across the middle ground of a dark, reflective scene. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level. The leftmost panel is closest to the foreground, with each subsequent panel to the right positioned slightly further back, creating depth. Initially, only the base of each panel is illuminated by a white light strip. This light then moves vertically upwards on each panel simultaneously, progressively revealing the charts and graphs displayed on their surfaces until the entire face of each panel is lit.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Four rectangular, transparent panels are arranged in a staggered formation against a black background, each illuminated from its base by a white light that reveals the content on its surface. The leftmost panel displays a chart titled \"Two ways to have more social impact,\" which has two blue rectangular areas on a grid. The second panel from the left shows a line graph with a steep upward curve against axes related to global income distribution. The third panel also contains a line graph. The rightmost panel presents a blue bar chart comparing \"Deaths per year\" from various causes, including \"Immunization,\" \"Diarrhoea,\" \"Malaria,\" and \"Smallpox,\" with a single dark bar to the right of \"Smallpox\" representing an unclear cause.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, abstract setting with a reflective floor, four transparent rectangular blocks are arranged in a staggered formation. Each block is illuminated from its base by a strip of white light, casting a soft glow and creating a reflection on the surface below. Various charts and graphs are directly displayed on the faces of these blocks. The leftmost block shows an area chart titled \"Two ways to have more social impact,\" with axes for \"Degree of improvement\" and \"Number of people helped.\" The next two blocks feature line graphs with steep upward curves, one related to global income distribution and the other to the cost-effectiveness of health interventions. The rightmost block presents a bar chart illustrating \"Deaths per year\" across different categories like \"Immunization\" and \"Malaria.\" As the lights move upward, the information on the charts becomes fully visible, revealing the portion below the lights. An overlay in the top right corner reads \"AD.\"**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
