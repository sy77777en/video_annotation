    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a barren, desert-like environment, a large group of soldiers dressed in dark green military uniforms runs across the terrain. They appear to be carrying rifles and packages, although this is difficult to discern due to the distance. Several large, freestanding, rectangular archways made of light-colored concrete are positioned in the foreground and midground, with the soldiers running between and around them. In the midground, there are several dilapidated and partially destroyed buildings, with smoke rising from a pit in front of the building area and a small explosion visible on the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a wide view of a desolate, mountainous landscape resembling an open-pit mine or quarry under a clear, sunny sky. The dusty, open ground is punctuated by several large, freestanding concrete structures shaped like rectangular arches. In the distance, nestled against the terraced hills, are several derelict, multi-story concrete buildings and skeletal industrial frameworks. Smoke is rising from a pit in front of the buildings, and a fiery explosion is occurring from another pit on the right. Numerous soldiers are seen running across the landscape, moving between the arches and toward the distant structures.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot, captured from a high angle, frames the scene through a large concrete arch that occupies the left foreground. In the middle ground, groups of soldiers run from the left and center towards the right, moving between several other large arches. Behind the soldiers, also in the middle ground, are dilapidated buildings and industrial structures, with smoke rising from the center-left. The background is composed of large, terraced mountains. During the shot, a small explosion occurs in the middle ground on the far right, near a separate group of soldiers.",
