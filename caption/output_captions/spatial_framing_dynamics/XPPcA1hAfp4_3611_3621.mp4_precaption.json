    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a top-down, pixel-art video game scene, a character with black hair, an orange shirt, blue pants, and a brown head covering is shown on a large, cross-shaped wooden platform built over dark water. The platform is illuminated by numerous torches and is arranged as a base. In the center is a blue bed. It is surrounded by various crafting stations, including a grey furnace, an anvil, and several workbenches. Two rows of green chests are lined up at the top of the platform, with additional grey chests placed in other locations. The game's user interface is visible, featuring health and status bars in the top-left corner, a minimap in the top-right, an inventory hotbar along the bottom, and controller button prompts in the bottom-right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows a pixel-art scene set in a dimly lit, cavernous area. Initially, a large, cross-shaped wooden platform with a patterned floor appears slightly to the left of the center of the frame and is eventually repositioned slightly to the right of the center, built over a body of dark water. The platform is illuminated by numerous torches and furnished with a central blue bed, various crafting stations including a furnace and an anvil, and multiple storage chests in green and gray. A small, pixelated character moves from the platform onto a wooden walkway that connects to the dirt and rock ground on the left. The surrounding land has patches of green and is also lit by torches. Several overlays are present on the screen: in the top-left corner are status bars; a mini-map is in the top-right; an inventory hotbar with tools and items lines the bottom; and controller button prompts are visible in the bottom-right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot with a top-down perspective, a pixelated character is initially positioned in the center of the frame, standing on a large, cross-shaped wooden platform in the middle ground. This platform, surrounded by dark water, occupies the central area of the scene, with UI elements like status bars, a minimap, and an inventory hotbar occupying the foreground in the top-left, top-right, and bottom of the frame, respectively. The character moves around the platform before walking onto a walkway on the left side of the frame. As the character moves, the camera pans left to follow, causing the large platform to shift from its central position to the right side of the frame. This movement brings the landmass on the left, previously in the background, into the middle ground on the left side of the screen, where the character comes to a stop.",
