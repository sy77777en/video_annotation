On this grid, the partial figures of two blue humanoids are positioned in the bottom corners of the frame; the forearms and hands of one figure are on the bottom left, while the lower leg and hand of another are on the bottom right.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two blue humanoid figures are partially visible, standing on a dark grey metal grid floor with thicker, light grey intersecting lines passing through it. The figure on the left, seen from the forearms down, holds a black rifle-like object with both hands. On the right, the lower leg, foot, and hand of another blue figure are visible, holding a thin, silver, needle-like tool. Through the grid, several blurred, grey humanoid figures in grey uniforms are seen sitting in rows.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an abstract, close-up composition, thick, light gray lines form a large cross within a finer, dark gray grid. Through this grid, indistinct, grey figures are visible in the midground and background. The scene under the grid structure is a wide shot. On the left side of the scene, a blue, partially-seen figure holds a black, rifle-like tool. On the right, another blue, partially-seen figure holds a thin, silver, needle-like tool, both positioned on the grid surface.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows two blue humanoid figures standing on a metal grid-like floor. They are positioned on either side of the frame, each holding a rifle, with parts of their hands and legs visible. The background below the floor is slightly blurred, and several grey humanoid figures are seated on what appears to be furniture, almost fully visible.",
