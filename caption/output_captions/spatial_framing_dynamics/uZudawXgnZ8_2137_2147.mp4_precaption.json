    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel-art scene viewed from a top-down perspective, a character with spiky gray hair, a red shirt, and blue pants walks through a grassy, forested area. The character swings a scythe, clearing some weeds. The landscape is filled with numerous green deciduous and pine trees, tree stumps, rocks, and patches of weeds. To the left is the grey, dilapidated foundation of a ruined building with broken wooden planks scattered on top. A dark wooden fence in the upper middle of the scene encloses a patch of blue, leafy plants. A small wooden building is partially visible in the upper right corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view shows a pixel art scene of a forested, rural area in the evening. The landscape is a mix of green grass and brown dirt, populated by numerous green pine and leafy trees, tree stumps, and rocks. A blue river flows from the top of the scene along the left side. Near the river stands a broken gray building foundation. A simple brown wooden fence separates a patch of blue plants from the main clearing, and the corner of another wooden structure is visible in the upper right. A small, pixelated character navigates through the woods, swinging a tool to cut down patches of weeds. Overlays are present on the screen: in the top right corner, a display shows the date, time around 7:10 PM, and currency. In the bottom left, an inventory item is displayed, and a toolbar with various tool icons runs along the bottom center. Additionally, a vertical energy bar with an \"E\" icon is located in the lower right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot is framed from a high-angle, top-down perspective, showing a pixel-art forest scene. Initially, a small character is positioned in the middle ground, slightly right of the frame's center. To the left, a ruined building foundation sits in the middle ground, adjacent to a river that runs from the top background to the bottom foreground. A wooden fence is located in the upper middle ground, with a small building partially visible in the top right background. The character moves from their starting position down and to the right, navigating through the dense arrangement of trees and stumps that populate the foreground, middle ground, and background. They briefly stop to swing a tool before continuing their path toward the right side of the frame, ending in the middle ground near the right edge. The camera remains static throughout the clip.",
