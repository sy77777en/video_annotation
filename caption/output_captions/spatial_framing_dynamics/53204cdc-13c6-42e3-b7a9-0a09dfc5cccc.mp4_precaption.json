    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man and a woman are shown from behind as they walk together. The man, positioned on the left, has dark, curly hair tied up and is wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt with a colorful graphic on the back, paired with light-colored jeans. His right arm is wrapped around the neck of the woman next to him. The woman has shoulder-length, golden brown hair and is wearing a black leather-style jacket over a black dress or skirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a third-person over-the-hip POV shot, two people are seen from behind walking across a grassy lawn toward a house at night. The single-story, light-colored house is decorated with a string of warm, white lights along its roofline. At the beginning, one of the windows emits a blue halo, while the light inside the other window continuously shifts between blue, green, and magenta. As the camera pans, a third window comes into view from the right side of the frame, glowing with a red halo. The pair proceeds along a concrete walkway leading to the front door. Light from inside the house illuminates the windows, casting a blue glow from one and a red glow from another. The textured trunk of a large tree is initially visible on the right but gradually moves out of the frame to the right, and some scattered cups are on the lawn.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium full shot frames a man and a woman from behind in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Initially, a large tree trunk is prominent in the right foreground, partially obscuring the view of a house in the background. As the couple walks forward across the lawn toward the house, the camera follows them, panning slightly to the left. This movement keeps the subjects centered as they move deeper into the scene, while the tree in the foreground gradually moves out of the frame to the right, revealing more of the house. The camera remains positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
