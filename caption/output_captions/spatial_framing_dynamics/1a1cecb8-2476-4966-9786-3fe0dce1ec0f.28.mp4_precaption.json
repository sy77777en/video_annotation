    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a cityscape scene, beginning with a level-angle view that transitions into a low, wide-angle perspective, showcasing an urban intersection under a bright, overcast sky. The scene includes asphalt roads with white-painted crosswalks, traffic lights, and large, leafy trees lining the street and nearby buildings. The camera's sweeping motion emphasizes the overall atmosphere and layout of the urban environment, focusing on the general setting and the sensation of moving through the space rather than highlighting any specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene captures a street intersection at dusk or on a heavily overcast day. The camera performs a brief and somewhat unsteady pan to the left, revealing a paved asphalt road marked with white crosswalks. The sky is bright and uniformly white with a gradient of light blue, and streetlights are on, casting a glow. On the periphery, large trees show significant motion blur, and buildings in the background are visible. A single car can be seen in the distance on the right side of the road, and additional cars become visible on the left side after the camera pans.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot of a street intersection. Initially, a white-painted crosswalk is in the foreground, spanning the bottom of the frame, with the asphalt road extending into the middle ground. A large, motion-blurred tree is in the center middle ground, with another tree and a streetlight positioned in the upper left. In the background on the right, a building and a distant car are visible. The camera then executes a quick pan to the left, causing the elements on the right to exit the frame. This motion shifts the central tree to the right side of the frame and reveals more of the intersection on the left, including parked cars in the middle ground. The camera maintains a low, level-angle perspective throughout the movement.",
