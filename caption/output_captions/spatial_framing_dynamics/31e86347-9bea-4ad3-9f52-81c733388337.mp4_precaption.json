    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, dark hair is shown in a disorienting sequence. She wears a short, red, strapless dress, black fingerless gloves, and black, knee-high, lace-up combat boots with thick soles. Holding a black microphone, she appears to rotate from an upside-down position to standing upright.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds inside a stark, minimalist room where the entire perspective rotates. Initially, a woman in a red dress and black boots appears upside down against a bright floor, with a dark-colored ceiling directly above her head. The ceiling features a light-hued, wrinkled material with a reflective texture at its center. As the view shifts, the perspective rotates to a normal angle, showing her standing upright on a light-colored, paneled floor. The walls are composed of similar light-colored panels, with one wall featuring a large, black circular element. Throughout the rotation, the woman holds a black microphone. The environment is illuminated by a cool light source from the floor, casting shadows upward.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In this full shot, a woman is initially positioned upside down in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, with her feet near the top edge. The entire scene, including the woman, then rotates counter-clockwise. As the frame turns, she transitions from her inverted state, through a diagonal orientation, until she is standing upright in the center of the frame. The shot concludes with the woman standing in the middle ground on a lit floor at the bottom of the frame, with the room's walls and ceiling in the background. A large black circular element is visible on the left wall in the background.",
