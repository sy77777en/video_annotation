    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three figures in an office setting. The most prominent figure is a man with short, silvery textured hair, wearing a black long-sleeved shirt. He is seen from the back, sitting in a gray office chair and working at a desk with multiple computer monitors. To his left, another figure, a humanoid robot with a smooth, metallic silver head and torso, is also seated at a desk working on a computer. A third, similar robotic figure is partially visible in the midground. As the video progresses, a large black object enters from the left side of the frame, gradually obscuring the view of the man and the robot next to him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place during the day inside a modern office with gray walls and large windows that reveal other buildings outside. The room is furnished with rows of white desks, each holding a computer monitor and office chair. An illuminated sign on the back wall displays the four-color Microsoft logo and the company name. Several figures, some of which are silver and robotic in form, are seated at the desks, facing their computers. The video includes overlay captions in black text with a glowing white outline that read, \"around the same time. Andre's friend is working as a developer at Microsoft.\" The camera moves in a clockwise arc around a man dressed in black. Midway through the video, a white text overlay appears at the bottom-left corner of the frame, displaying: \"[2,9]\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of an office, showing three employees working at their computers. One employee, who is closer to the camera, is in focus, with his upper body visible. As the camera moves downward, a black object, likely a computer screen, gradually obscures half of the frame from left to right, leaving only one of the employee's arms in view.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of an office, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. A man is seated in the center-right of the frame in the middle ground, while a humanoid robot is positioned to his left, also in the middle ground. In the background, the illuminated Microsoft logo is visible on the top center wall. As the shot progresses, a large, black foreground object enters from the left side of the frame and moves to the right, gradually obscuring the robot and the left side of the man's workspace. The shot concludes with this foreground object covering the left half of the frame, leaving only the right side of the scene, including the man's right arm and his computer monitors, in view.",
