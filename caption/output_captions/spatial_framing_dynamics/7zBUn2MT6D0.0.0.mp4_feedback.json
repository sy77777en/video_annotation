    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, a person is positioned in the center of the frame, sitting in the foreground on a diving board that extends from the bottom edge. The board is flanked by metal handrails in the bottom left and bottom right foreground. A large swimming pool occupies the middle ground and background, filling the upper portion of the frame. Other people are visible in the middle ground along the right edge of the frame, next to the pool. Large shadows are cast across the water in the top left and top center. The camera is positioned directly above the main subject, creating a top-down perspective of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a bird's-eye view, top-down perspective, a person with short, dark, curly hair and a light complexion is the main subject. This individual, who appears to be a young man or boy, is seen from above, standing on the edge of a dark-colored diving board and leaning slightly forward with their arms naturally hanging by their sides. They are shirtless and wearing bright yellow swimming trunks. Several people were standing by the pool, with the most noticeable being a person in a yellow short-sleeved shirt and red shorts near the right edge of the pool.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye view, aerial level, overhead perspective of the main subject, the scene is set at an indoor swimming pool during the daytime. The rectangular pool contains water that is slightly rippling against the bright blue pool walls, with dark lane lines and starting blocks visible on the bottom. In the foreground, a shirtless person wearing yellow swimming trunks is standing at the edge of a dark gray diving board, leaning slightly forward and looking down at the water. Silver metal handrails are positioned on either side of the board. A light-colored deck surrounds the pool, and large, geometric shadows, likely cast by the building structure or window frames, fall across approximately half of the water.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
