    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the center of the scene, an older, light-skinned man with a bald head, short white hair on the sides, and a full white beard sits looking down intently. He is wearing a beige trench coat over a collared shirt. On the right side of the frame, another light-skinned man with short, thinning hair that is a mix of white and dark is also seated, leaning forward and looking down, with his back mostly to the camera; he is dressed in a dark jacket. In the foreground on the left, only the back of a third man's bald head and shoulder are visible, but he eventually exits the frame as the camera moves.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place during the day inside a modern train car, characterized by a neutral color palette and clean design. The interior is furnished with rows of high-backed, light-beige seats. Through a large window, a green, rural landscape is visible, blurred by the train's rapid motion. The camera is positioned behind one row of seats, looking toward two men seated further down the aisle.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot is framed from behind a row of train seats in the foreground. In the middle ground, a man with a white beard is positioned in the center of the frame, looking down. To his right, another man is also in the middle ground, seen mostly from the back as he leans forward. The back of a third man's head is initially visible in the bottom left foreground, but he moves out of the frame to the left as the shot progresses. In the background, a window on the right side of the frame shows a green landscape blurring past. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level and remains relatively stable throughout the clip.",
