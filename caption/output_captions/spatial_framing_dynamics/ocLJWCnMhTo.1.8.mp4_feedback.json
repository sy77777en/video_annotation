    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot from a high, bird's-eye angle, looking down at a group of people positioned in the center of the frame on a black and white checkered floor that occupies the background. A person with blonde hair is in the bottom left quadrant, while another person in blue is in the center, both in the middle ground, as confetti falls from above them, filling the foreground. The entire scene then rotates 180 degrees, inverting the perspective. The shot transitions to a low-angle view looking up at the subjects, who are now upside down at the top of the frame against the checkered surface, which now functions as the ceiling. The confetti continues to fall from the top of the frame toward the camera's position at the bottom, and green tiled walls become visible in the background at the sides and bottom of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of people is shown from a bird's-eye view on a black and white checkered floor. One individual with short, blonde hair is wearing a blue top, while another person, also in blue, is at the center of the activity. Several other individuals dressed in red or white clothing are positioned around the frame. The scene is filled with a shower of small, colorful particles resembling confetti. The perspective then shifts to eye-level, showing the people upside down, as if they are on the ceiling, amidst the continuing fall of particles.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye view, the scene unfolds indoors on a black and white checkered floor, where a chaotic flurry of colorful confetti fills the air around several people. The footage has a grainy, vintage quality and is presented within a frame defined by black bars at the top and bottom. In the background, walls with green tiles are visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
