    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases a digital painting of a sunlit mountain valley. In the midground, a large, single-story cabin with a grey stone foundation and dark brown wooden walls stands prominently. To its right is a smaller cabin made of similar dark wood. The landscape features rolling green hills, large grey boulders, and a few scattered pine trees. A light brown dirt path winds through the grassy terrain. In the background, large green mountains rise against a light blue sky filled with white, fluffy clouds. The entire painting is displayed within an editing software interface, with toolbars visible at the top, bottom, left, and right of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a software or system interface displays the Adobe After Effects program, with a digital painting of a sunlit mountain valley in the central composition window. The outdoor scene features two rustic buildings made of dark wood and stone, situated among rolling green hills. A dirt path winds through the grassy landscape, which is dotted with large grey rocks and a few pine trees. In the background, large mountains rise against a bright blue sky with white clouds. The software's interface, including a timeline at the bottom and various tool panels on the sides, frames the artwork.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "A static screen recording shows the Adobe After Effects interface, which occupies the top, bottom, left, and right portions of the frame, enclosing a digital painting of a mountain landscape in the center. Within the painting, the scene is viewed from an eye-level perspective relative to the structures. The foreground at the bottom of the image contains grassy terrain and rocks. In the middle ground, a large cabin is positioned in the left-center, with a smaller cabin to its right. The background is composed of large mountains and a sky that fill the upper half of the artwork. The entire composition, including both the software interface and the painting, remains completely static throughout the video.",
