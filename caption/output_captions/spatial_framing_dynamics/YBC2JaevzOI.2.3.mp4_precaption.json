    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man is shown from the chest up, sitting in the driver's seat of a car at night. He is wearing a white baseball cap forwards and a teal-colored hoodie. The scene is very dark, with his face partially illuminated from his left side by a soft, unseen light source. He looks directly forward with a somewhat nervous expression, his mouth slightly open. The top of the steering wheel is visible at the bottom right of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Inside a car at night, a young man wearing a teal hoodie and a light-colored baseball cap sits in the driver's seat, with part of his right hand resting on the steering wheel. The interior of the vehicle is dark, with his face partially illuminated by a soft, unseen light source. Through the rear window, the red glow of a taillight is visible against the otherwise black background, where a few faint, distant lights can be seen. The top of the dark steering wheel is prominent in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video features a static close-up shot of a young man positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. In the foreground, the top of the steering wheel is visible at the bottom of the frame. Behind the man in the background, a red taillight is visible through the rear window, positioned slightly to the left of center. The camera remains stationary at the man's level throughout the shot.",
