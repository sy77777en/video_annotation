    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures an expansive aerial view of a sprawling urban center set against a dramatic backdrop of distant, hazy mountains under a partly cloudy blue sky. The foreground and midground are characterized by a seamless transition of lower-rise residential buildings and abundant green trees, leading into the dense downtown core filled with numerous modern skyscrapers and high-rises. To the left, a body of water features a bridge over it, enhancing the connection between different parts of the city. The camera's broad perspective is intended to capture the overall scale and atmosphere of the environment, focusing on the relationship between the dense urban development and the vast natural landscape, creating a comprehensive portrait of the location.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a sweeping aerial view of Vancouver, Canada, during the daytime. The camera moves slowly downward over a foreground of lower-rise residential buildings and abundant green trees. In the distance, the dense downtown skyline rises, featuring numerous skyscrapers and several construction cranes. A body of water and a bridge are visible to the left of the city center. The entire urban landscape is set against a backdrop of a large mountain range, with some snow visible on the peaks, under a blue sky with scattered white clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot. In this extreme wide, high-angle aerial shot, the foreground at the bottom of the frame is composed of low-rise residential buildings and trees. The middle ground features a dense downtown skyline in the center, with a body of water and a bridge to the left. A mountain range under a partly cloudy sky occupies the background across the top of the frame. The camera performs a slow, subtle downward and forward movement, causing the foreground elements to gradually rise and move toward the bottom edge of the frame, while the central skyline in the middle ground appears to get slightly closer.",
