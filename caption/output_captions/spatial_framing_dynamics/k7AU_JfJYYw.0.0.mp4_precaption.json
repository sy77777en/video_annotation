    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with light skin and short, dark, tousled hair stands in profile facing the left side of the scene. He is dressed in a monochromatic outfit consisting of a black short-sleeved t-shirt and black trousers. He holds a long, wooden pool cue vertically in his right hand, gripping it closer to the top of the shaft, while his left hand is tucked casually into his pants pocket. He stands directly beside a billiard table that features a black frame and a red felt surface, upon which several billiard balls in white, black, black-and-white, and yellow-and-white are visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a spacious, modern living area with a shiny, light-colored tiled floor, a black pool table with a red felt surface is positioned in the foreground. A few pool balls, including white, black, black-and-white, and yellow-and-white, are scattered on the table. A person dressed in black stands beside the table, holding a cue stick. The camera moves downward, revealing their patterned sneakers and a black bag resting on the floor. The background features an open-plan space with a bar area furnished with a mix of red and blue stools, a white chaise lounge, and a doorway leading to another room. A black and white striped curtain hangs on the left.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot of a man standing in the center-right middle ground, positioned next to a pool table that occupies the left foreground. In the background, a bar area is visible on the left, and a white chaise lounge is on the right. The camera, initially at the subject's level, tilts downward, reframing the scene into a medium shot that focuses on the man's lower body from the waist down. In this final composition, his patterned sneakers and a black bag on the floor are revealed in the bottom-center foreground, while the leg of the pool table becomes more prominent in the left foreground. The man's position remains in the center-right middle ground throughout the camera movement.",
