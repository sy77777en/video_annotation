    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of young, light-skinned men are gathered around and on top of a red vintage convertible car. Most of the men wear matching light gray jumpsuits, while one man in the center is dressed in a black t-shirt, black pants, and a black leather jacket. A man wearing a dark brown jumpsuit is standing in the middle of the car. All the men have short, dark, slicked-back hair and are in various animated poses with open mouths, as if singing or shouting in unison. The car is a shiny red convertible with large tail fins and a white flame-like design along its side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a large, brightly lit indoor space with plain, light-gray walls and flooring. A vintage red convertible with prominent tail fins extends across the entire frame. The car is decorated with white, jagged, lightning-bolt-style graphics along its sides. A group of men, most in matching gray jumpsuits, are arranged on and around the vehicle, moving independently. In the background, a large, white, grid-like projection is displayed on the wall.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot filmed at the subjects' level, a red convertible car is positioned in the middle ground, extending across the entire bottom of the frame. A group of men are arranged on and around the car. In the foreground, a man in black stands at the center, flanked by two men in gray jumpsuits, all jogging in place. Directly behind them in the middle ground, another man in a dark jumpsuit stands atop the car's trunk, while the rest of the men, clad in gray jumpsuits, are distributed across the middle ground and background, sitting on or standing around the vehicle. The entire group gestures and moves energetically in unison. In the background, a white grid pattern is visible on the wall behind the central figures. The camera and the car remain stationary throughout the shot.",
