    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a full black wetsuit, black gloves, and a red and black hood with an attached snorkel is in the water, holding onto the side of a black inflatable boat. The video then reveals three orcas swimming together underwater. The large marine mammals have their characteristic black-and-white coloration, with black backs and white undersides and patches near their eyes, as they move through the greenish-blue water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place on a choppy, cold body of water under a pale sky, with a snow-covered mountain range in the distance. A person in a black wetsuit with a red hood and a snorkel is in the water, holding onto the side of a black inflatable boat. The perspective then submerges into the murky, deep teal water, where several black-and-white orcas are seen swimming.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera starts at the surface of the sea to shoot a person getting off a boat into the sea, showing in a medium shot. Then it goes into the sea to show a full shot of three killer whales in the sea.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a person in the water, positioned in the center-left middle ground while holding onto an inflatable boat that occupies the left foreground. A snow-covered mountain range is visible in the distant background. The camera, positioned above the person, follows them as the view submerges, transitioning to an underwater full shot of three orcas. The orcas are initially arranged across the middle ground, with one in the top-left, one in the center, and one on the right. From a vantage point above them, the camera observes as the orcas swim from the middle ground toward the foreground, increasing in size within the frame.",
