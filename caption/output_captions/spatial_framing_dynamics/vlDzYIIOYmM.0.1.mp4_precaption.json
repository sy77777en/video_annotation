    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Three women are in a gray rowboat. The woman in the foreground, who is filming, has long blonde hair and is wearing a pink beanie with ski goggles resting on it, a red and green patterned fleece jacket, and pink pants. She smiles at the camera and at one point points forward, wearing sunglasses over her eyes. In the middle of the boat, a woman with light-colored hair is rowing with wooden oars. She is wearing a blue long-sleeved shirt, black pants, and a black beanie. A third woman with blonde hair sits in the back of the boat, wearing a maroon jacket, a light gray beanie, and sunglasses.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a selfie point of view, the scene captures three people in a small gray rowboat on a calm, blue-green alpine lake. The shot is taken on a bright, sunny day under a clear blue sky, with the sun creating a lens flare. In the background, towering, rocky mountains partially covered in white snow rise steeply from the water's edge. One person rows the boat with wooden oars while the person holding the camera initially smiles directly at it, but by the end, they turn their head and face away from the camera.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured at the subjects' level, a woman in the foreground occupies the bottom left of the frame. In the middle ground, a second woman is positioned in the center of the frame, rowing the boat, while a third woman sits to her right. The boat itself fills the bottom of the frame, surrounded by the lake in the middle ground. The background is dominated by large, snow-covered mountains that occupy the top half of the frame, with one on the left and another on the right. The woman in the foreground initially faces the camera before turning her head to the right and pointing forward, shifting her orientation within the frame.",
