    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A humanoid character with an atypical appearance stands in a grassy area. The character is clad in a simple, hooded purple-grey cloak that conceals its arms, while its torso is partially visible, adorned with a light purple top featuring a crossbody strap across the chest. Only the thin, stick-like legs are exposed. Its head is a round, orange, pumpkin-like sphere featuring two large, light brown oval eyes and a simple line for a mouth, reminiscent of a jack-o'-lantern. In the midground, a circular stone well with a wooden crossbar, rope, and bucket is positioned in the center of a round, brick-paved area. The scene includes a user interface with a gold coin icon next to the number 22, an inventory bar showing icons of two bags, a leaf, a stick, and a pink orb, and two vertical status bars on the right\u2014one completely filled with a blue substance and the other entirely empty.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, a small character with a carved orange head and a purple cloak walks across a grassy yard in a stylized, cartoonish setting. The yard contains a central stone well surrounded by a circular brick path, with a tree stump and a log in the midground. Several light brown picket fences are positioned in both the midground and background. In the foreground, a wooden dock extends over blue water next to the edge of a wooden building. A heads-up display is overlaid on the screen, featuring a coin icon with the number 22 in the bottom-left corner, an inventory bar at the bottom-center, and two vertical status bars in the bottom-right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static, high-angle wide shot, a humanoid character is positioned in the center-left of the frame, standing in the middle ground. The foreground is occupied by a wooden dock and the edge of a building at the bottom of the screen, with user interface elements overlaid at the bottom-left, bottom-center, and bottom-right. In the middle ground, a stone well is located in the center, surrounded by a circular brick path, with a tree stump to the left, a log to the right, and a picket fence along the right edge. Another picket fence lines the background at the top of the frame. The character takes a single step forward, moving slightly toward the bottom of the frame but remaining in the middle ground.",
