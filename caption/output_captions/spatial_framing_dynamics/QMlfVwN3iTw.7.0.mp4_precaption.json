    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a wide shot of a cityscape featuring a row of modern, multi-story townhouses built directly on the edge of a canal, with the camera dynamically zooming out to reveal more of the scene. The buildings display a unique and varied architectural style, with boxy structures in a palette of white, dark grey, yellow-ochre, and olive green, all featuring large glass windows and balconies. Several small boats, including a prominent red one, are moored along the waterfront in the rippling green water. There is no single main subject, as the composition focuses on the collective architectural character of the street and the tranquil, waterfront atmosphere. The shot's purpose is to establish a sense of place rather than highlight a specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A row of modern, multi-story houses with varied geometric facades stands at the edge of a body of water in Amsterdam. The buildings range in color from white and tan to dark gray, featuring large glass windows, balconies, and flat roofs. In the foreground, the greenish water reflects the overcast sky. Several small boats, including a prominent red one and a few white ones, are moored along the waterfront in front of the residences, which have small docks and patios at water level. A few small trees and plants are visible on the ground-level patios and upper balconies.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot presented in a static wide shot. A row of modern houses occupies the middle and upper portions of the frame, extending from the left to the right edge in the middle ground. The canal water fills the bottom third of the frame, situated in the foreground. Several small boats are moored in the foreground at the water's edge, directly in front of the houses, with a red boat positioned in the bottom right and other boats to its left. The camera is positioned at a low height, slightly above the water level, looking straight across at the base of the buildings.",
