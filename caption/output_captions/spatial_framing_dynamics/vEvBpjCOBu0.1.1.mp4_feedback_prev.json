    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a wide shot from a high angle, showing miniature military vehicles and supplies arranged in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. Behind them, in the middle ground, are grids of wooden crates, with a large group on the left and a smaller group on the top right, all set upon a map that serves as the background. The camera then pulls back slightly as all the miniature vehicles, supplies, and crates lift off the map, break into smaller pieces, and fly away. As these elements disappear, a miniature factory materializes in the middle ground, positioned centrally over the word \"Berlin\" on the map, with smoke rising from its chimney toward the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **On a textured, aged map showing parts of Europe, including the cities of Szczecin and Berlin, several miniature objects are arranged. Initially, the scene includes four miniature gray tanks, two green military trucks, and stacks of what appear to be miniature pipes and shells. Behind these military items are several grids of dark brown wooden crates. The tanks, trucks, supplies, and crates then lift off the map and disappear. Following this, a miniature, multi-story brick factory with a tall smokestack appears on the map over the word \"Berlin.\" The factory has lit windows, and dark smoke rises from its smokestack.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is a 3D animation set on a textured, vintage map of Europe, with city names like \"Szczecin\" and \"Berlin\" visible, and a red line marking a border. Initially, miniature gray tanks, green trucks, and dark brown wooden crates are arranged in formations on the map's surface. As the camera pulls back, these miniature vehicles and supplies are animated to break apart and fly away. A miniature brick factory with lit windows and a smoking chimney is present from the beginning and gradually becomes more visible over the location of Berlin as small, glowing particles float in the air. An overlay in the bottom-left corner reads, \"[6]; David Rumsey Map Collection, David Rumsey Map Center, Stanford Libraries.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
