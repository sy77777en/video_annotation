    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In an overhead view, a woman is performing a spinning sweep kick while balancing on her head on the ground, surrounded by a cascade of glowing blue light projections. She has dark, shoulder-length hair and is dressed in a black long-sleeved top with white cuffs and black pants; her left leg is a metallic prosthetic. To the upper right, a second person with dark brown hair, wearing a black suit, is shown jumping down, leaping over the woman, and moving toward the upper left of the frame. On the right side of the scene, a third person is seated on a dark surface, wearing a tan jacket over a white collared shirt with a white bow at the neck, their hands clasped together in their lap, but depicted without a head. Next to this third person, part of a fourth man in a suit is visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye view, the scene unfolds indoors over a dark, reflective floor. To the right, a dark couch sits partially on a red carpeted area, where two people are seated. In the center, a woman in a dark suit is performing a spinning sweep kick while balancing on her head on the ground. Meanwhile, a man in a suit is captured mid-leap, jumping from the upper right of the frame and moving toward the upper left. Swirling, glowing blue particles shaped like leaves, created by a light projection effect, are scattered throughout the space. A thin, vertical green line of light is visible in the center, and a bright light source near the bottom creates a lens flare.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, overhead perspective, this full shot captures a dynamic scene on a dark floor in the middle ground. A woman is positioned in the center-left, performing a spinning kick on the ground. Simultaneously, a man leaps diagonally from the upper right to the upper left of the frame, moving through the air above the woman. On the right side of the frame, two static figures are seated on a dark couch, also in the middle ground. The scene is overlaid with foreground elements, including swirling blue light particles concentrated on the left and center, a thin vertical green line of light in the center, and a bright light source creating a lens flare from the bottom center.",
