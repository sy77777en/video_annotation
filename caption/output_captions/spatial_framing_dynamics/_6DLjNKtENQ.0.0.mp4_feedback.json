    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man in a military uniform is positioned in the left-center of the foreground. In the out-of-focus background, another man is situated in the bottom left, and a third man is located in the bottom right. Two long, rectangular light fixtures are suspended from the ceiling in the middle ground, positioned above the main subject. The main subject, initially looking slightly toward the right, turns his head to face forward and then shifts his gaze toward the left side of the frame. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man with a bald head and a serious expression is shown in a military-style room. He is wearing a US Army camouflage uniform with an American flag patch and a black shield-shaped unit patch with a green 'A' on his right sleeve. His name tape reads \"BLAKE.\" Initially, his gaze is directed slightly to his right. He then briefly looks straight ahead and slightly downward before turning his head to look toward the left side of the frame. In the midground and out of focus, another Black man in a camouflage military uniform is visible at the bottom left of the frame. A white man and another bald man are located at the bottom right of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit, modern indoor space with dark walls and a dark ceiling. At least three long, rectangular light fixtures are suspended from the ceiling, providing the primary source of illumination, with one partially visible on the far left. In the foreground, a man in a camouflage military uniform, which includes an American flag patch on the right sleeve, is present. The background is largely out of focus, showing the silhouettes of other people and a faint blue light emanating from the right side of the room.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
