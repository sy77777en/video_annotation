    "pre_caption": "The camera appears to be mounted on top of the helmet of the person in red, tail-tracking them in a full-body shot that keeps them centered in the foreground. As this central subject skates, the background scenery of the ice rink moves accordingly. Another ice hockey player in a yellow jersey is visible in the background, positioned in the top left of the frame.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is captured from a high-angle, forward-facing perspective, seemingly from a camera mounted on the helmet of a person playing ice hockey. This person has long, dark hair extending from beneath a white hockey helmet and is wearing a plain red long-sleeved jersey over black hockey pants with white and red stripes at the knees. They are also wearing black ice skates. In the upper left of the scene, another hockey player appears, dressed in a yellow jersey and dark pants.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, mounted on the top of a hockey player's helmet, captures the action on an indoor ice rink. The perspective follows the player, who wears a red jersey and a white helmet, as they skate across the bright white ice. The ice surface shows reflections and curved gray lines. In the middle ground, another player in a yellow and dark-colored uniform can be seen skating.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera appears to be mounted on top of the helmet of this person in red. It tail tracks her, capturing her playing ice hockey in a full-body shot. As the shot moves, another ice hockey player in yellow enters the frame from the upper left.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
