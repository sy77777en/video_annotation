    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents three identical, computer-generated devices arranged in a row. Each device, resembling a spotlight, features a large, conical light beam with vertical striations. This beam is projected from a dark gray, multi-jointed arm that connects to a circular base. Positioned directly beneath each downward-angled device is a small, rounded, bushy green shrub, which is illuminated by the light beam emanating from the device above it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, studio-like setting, three golden, cone-shaped spotlights are arranged in a row. They are mounted on gray, articulated stands and positioned on a black, highly reflective surface. Instead of reflecting their silhouettes, a faint white light is visible at the center of the surface. The spotlights are angled downwards, and as the scene progresses, they illuminate small, green, leafy bushes that materialize directly beneath each light, without casting reflections on the glossy surface. A gray rectangular box containing the white text \"[23]\" is present as an overlay in the bottom-left corner.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features three computer-generated devices similar to those that absorb light to facilitate photosynthesis in plants. It begins by showing a close-up of the devices, and as the camera moves, it gradually reveals a wider view of the devices.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot of three identical, golden, cone-shaped devices arranged in a row across the middle ground, extending from the left to the right of the frame. These devices are situated on a reflective surface at the bottom of the screen against a solid black background. The camera then pulls back, widening the view to a medium shot. As this happens, a small, green shrub materializes in the middle ground directly beneath each device, positioned at the bottom of the frame. The final framing shows the three devices angled downward, illuminating the shrubs below them. Throughout the shot, the camera maintains a position level with the subjects, and a small text overlay remains fixed in the bottom-left corner.",
