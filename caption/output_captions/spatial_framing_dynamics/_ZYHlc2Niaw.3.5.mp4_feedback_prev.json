    "pre_caption": "This high-angle wide shot begins positioned behind a group of parade participants in the foreground, with a man in a suit featuring a white skeleton design located in the bottom center. A dense crowd and large skeletal floats occupy the middle ground, stretching across the frame. The camera then ascends and tilts upward, transitioning into an extreme wide shot that reveals the vast scale of the event. In the final framing, the massive crowd fills the entire scene from the foreground to the background, with a large cathedral becoming fully visible in the distant background at the top center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A vast and dense crowd of people fills a wide city street during a large-scale parade. The participants, a mix of men and women, are dressed in a combination of contemporary clothing and elaborate costumes, many of which are themed around the Day of the Dead. A large number of people wear dark attire, such as black suits and dresses, with some men sporting bowler hats. One man in the foreground wears a black suit jacket with a white, ornate skeleton design on the back. Towering over the people are large parade floats, including giant, articulated skeletons and oversized, decorated skulls, moving along the street. The camera angle primarily captures the scene from behind the crowd, focusing on the vibrant costumes and towering floats.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A massive daytime parade moves through a wide city square in Mexico City, with the Metropolitan Cathedral visible in the background under a hazy, sepia-toned sky. The street is densely packed with thousands of people participating in a Day of the Dead celebration. Many in the procession are dressed in black formal wear and skeleton-themed costumes, with some wearing top hats and bowler hats. Giant white skeletal puppets and large skulls tower over the crowd. The camera starts from behind a few participants and gradually moves forward, ascends, and tilts upward, revealing the immense scale of the festival as it fills the entire square.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
