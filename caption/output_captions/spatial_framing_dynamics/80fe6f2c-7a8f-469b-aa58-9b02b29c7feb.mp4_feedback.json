    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot where a runner's lower legs and feet are positioned in the foreground, primarily occupying the center of the frame. The reddish-brown running track with white lines extends from the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame into the middle ground. In the background, out-of-focus lights are visible in the upper right. The camera is positioned low, at the level of the runner's feet, and tracks alongside them as they run. This creates a dynamic effect where the track and its lines appear to rush towards the viewer from the middle ground, while the runner's feet remain consistently framed in the center foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A level-angle, motion-blurred shot follows the lower legs and feet of a person as they run. The individual, whose other characteristics are obscured, is wearing white athletic shoes. Their feet are shown in motion, repeatedly making contact with a reddish-brown running track marked with white lines.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place outdoors at night on a running track, illuminated by a series of tall streetlights that cast pools of light onto the reddish-brown, textured surface marked with white lane lines. The environment is bordered by dark, leafy trees, and the air appears slightly misty, with a faint haze visible around the lights. The ground is smooth and rubberized, with clear linear markings and subtle reflections from the artificial lighting. Motion is evident as a pair of legs in white athletic shoes moves swiftly along the track, with the shoes and lower legs sharply defined against the blurred background, suggesting rapid movement. The overall scene is quiet and focused, with no overlays or additional visual elements present.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
