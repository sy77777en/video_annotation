    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three humanoid robots, each positioned in its own separate vertical compartment. These robots are bronze-colored, with blocky bodies, wide-brimmed fedora-style hats, and glowing red eyes. Straps resembling ammunition belts are slung across their chests. A large, dark, human-shaped shadow with eyes, a mouth, and what appear to be horns on its head obscures most of the middle robot, though its glowing red eyes remain visible through the shadow. As the frame pans left, a tall seated sculpture with a bronze-hued mask and spiky headdress enters from the left side. The shadow morphs into a larger form, gradually covering more of the frame, without extending large wing-like appendages or transforming its hands into claws.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, cavernous interior, the scene opens on three identical, blocky robotic figures standing in separate, vertical alcoves, each wearing a hat and featuring glowing red eyes. The central robot is partially obscured by a human-shaped shadow, but the glowing red eyes belong to the robot. The view then transitions to another part of the dark space, revealing a large, ornate throne made of a stone-like material. The throne is decorated with a mask-like face and has spiky protrusions extending from its top. A silhouetted figure with a large, clawed hand is positioned in the background, partially obscuring the view of the throne. The environment is dimly lit with dark browns and grays, accented by faint purple light and the red glow from the figures' eyes.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a shadow moving through the scene. It begins with a full shot of the shadow along with three robots, then the camera pans to track the shadow, revealing a full shot of another sculpture and the shadow growing larger. Finally, the shadow is presented in a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot, presenting three robots in the background, positioned on the left, center, and right of the frame. A large shadow occupies the middle ground in the center, obscuring the central robot. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, then pans to the left, following the shadow as it moves from the center towards the left side of the frame. This camera movement reveals a tall sculpture entering from the left, positioned in the middle ground. The shadow simultaneously moves into the foreground and expands, transitioning the composition to a close-up of the shadow, which now dominates the left side of the frame and partially obscures the sculpture behind it.",
