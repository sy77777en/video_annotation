    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a residential scenery shot, capturing a tranquil suburban street in Japan on a bright, sunny day. The central focus is a two-story house that blends traditional and modern architectural elements, most notably its prominent, glossy blue-grey tiled roof (kawara). Below the roof, the house features brown-framed windows and light-colored siding. A meticulously manicured Japanese garden, with sculpted pine trees and several shrubs with vibrant red foliage, occupies the front yard, enclosed by a brown metal fence and a low block wall. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to convey the peaceful atmosphere and aesthetic of the environment, focusing on the interplay of architecture, nature, and the clear blue sky with fluffy clouds rather than a specific person or action.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A quiet residential street in Japan is captured on a sunny day. The scene features a two-story house with a traditional blue-tiled roof. In front of the house, a manicured garden with sculpted pine trees, red-leafed maples, and green shrubbery is enclosed by a low gray block wall and a brown metal fence with a matching gate. The house has brown-framed windows on the upper floor and a bay window on the ground level. Neighboring houses are visible on either side, and power lines are strung across the bright blue sky, which is dotted with fluffy white clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a residential scene. The primary subject, a two-story house, is located in the middle ground, occupying the center and right portions of the frame. In the foreground, a low block wall and a brown metal fence run along the bottom of the frame from left to right, with a gate positioned in the right foreground. A manicured garden is situated in the middle ground, mostly on the left side, between the foreground fence and the house. A neighboring house is visible in the left background, and another is on the far right in the middle ground. The sky and clouds fill the top of the frame in the background, with power lines stretching across the upper left and right. A small portion of the street is visible in the bottom left foreground. The camera is positioned at a slightly low angle, looking up toward the house from across the street.",
