    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated bar chart on a light beige background with a faint grid compares two sets of data. On the left, a black, circular logo for the Wikimedia Foundation is positioned next to a short, light blue bar labeled \"400,000,\" which completes its growth shortly after the video begins. To its right is a line-art, puzzle-piece globe logo for Wikipedia. A very tall, light blue bar animates upwards next to the Wikipedia logo, extending far beyond the top of the view before the camera finishes zooming out, with the label \"7 bil.\" at its base. The text \"Monthly visits\" is centered below the two logos.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An animated bar chart is displayed against a light beige background with a faint grid pattern. Initially, the text \"Monthly visits\" is centered at the lower-center of the screen. On the left, a small blue bar appears and grows next to a black circular logo, with the number \"400,000\" displayed below the bar. To the right, a puzzle globe logo is shown. A second, extremely tall blue bar rapidly grows upward next to the globe logo, with the text \"7 bil.\" displayed at its base. An overlay in the bottom left corner reads \"[2,12]\". The view zooms out to show the full, towering height of the second bar, starkly contrasting with the diminutive size of the first. After the camera zooms out, the faint grid pattern becomes invisible, and the text \"Monthly visits\" shifts to the bottom of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a straight-on, medium shot of several elements in the middle ground against a gridded background. A small bar and the number \"400,000\" are at the bottom left, next to a Wikimedia logo in the left-center. To its right, in the right-center, is a Wikipedia logo, with the text \"Monthly visits\" centered below both logos. A second, extremely tall bar then animates upwards from the bottom right, next to the Wikipedia logo, with \"7 bil.\" appearing at its base. As this bar grows beyond the top of the frame, the camera zooms out to a very wide shot. In the final composition, all elements are positioned at the bottom of the frame, with the first bar and logo appearing tiny on the left, starkly contrasted by the second bar, which now forms a massive vertical line extending up the right side of the screen.",
