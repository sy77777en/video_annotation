    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short, blond hair is shown from behind, walking through a dark, wooded area. He is wearing a dark brown leather jacket that has a light-colored, thick shearling collar and matching trim along the bottom hem and cuffs. He is also wearing dark-colored pants. On the ground to his right, a small, silver-colored bear trap lies among the fallen leaves and rocks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot framing the character from the hip up follows a man in a dark leather jacket as he walks along a narrow, unpaved path through a dark and overgrown forest. The scene is set during an overcast day with a gloomy, foggy atmosphere, casting the surroundings in low light. The path is flanked by dense vegetation, including mossy rocks, bare trees, and autumnal foliage in muted shades of brown and green. As the character proceeds, a small, discarded bear trap is visible on the ground before he passes a dilapidated wooden shack on the left, which has weathered, broken planks, an open doorway, and both a large wooden wheel and a black iron wheel leaning against its side.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a 3D game video. The camera follows the character\u2019s movements from behind. The character is shown in a medium shot, while the framing leaves more space to present a wide shot of the surrounding scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a 3D game video where the camera maintains a medium shot on a man, following him from behind at his level, while also capturing a wide shot of the surrounding scene. Initially, the man is in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a path that recedes into the background. The path is framed by dense vegetation and rocks in the foreground and middle ground on the left and right. A bear trap rests in the middle ground to the right of the path. As the man walks forward, remaining centered while moving deeper into the background, the bear trap shifts into the right foreground before exiting the frame. A dilapidated wooden shack then enters the scene from the left, occupying the left middle ground. The man walks past it, causing the shack to move into the left foreground and eventually off-screen as the forest elements continuously scroll from the background toward the foreground on both sides.",
