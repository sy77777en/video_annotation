    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a rolling green landscape that fills the entire frame, with a stone wall and path running from the bottom left into the middle ground. As the camera moves backward and upward from a high angle, a person is revealed entering from the bottom of the frame, establishing an extreme wide shot. The subject is positioned in the bottom center foreground, walking along the path toward the lower edge of the frame. The camera's continued backward movement frames the small figure against the vast landscape, which extends from the middle ground to the background under a cloudy sky at the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a dynamic, high-angle shot of a vast, green, rolling landscape under a cloudy sky, as the camera moves backward and upward. A person comes into view from the bottom of the frame, revealed against the expansive scenery. The individual is dressed in khaki overalls with a dark long-sleeve shirt underneath, has grayish-white facial hair, and carries a small package in each hand. They proceed to walk along a dirt path that runs alongside a low stone wall winding through the hills.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an expansive view of rolling green hills under a completely overcast sky. The vast, treeless landscape is covered in shades of green grass and low vegetation. A low, crumbling stone wall runs through a shallow depression, paralleled by a narrow dirt path. As the camera pulls back, a figure dressed in khaki overalls with a dark long-sleeve shirt underneath emerges at the bottom of the frame, walking toward the lower edge. Eventually, the camera stops its backward movement, bringing the figure closer to the bottom of the frame. The scene is presented in a widescreen format with black letterbox bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes an extreme wide shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",
