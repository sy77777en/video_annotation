    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video follows a man with short, blond hair, who is consistently viewed from behind. He wears a dark, leather-like jacket with a light-colored shearling collar and a belt detail at the waist. After he enters a dark room, a black vintage typewriter becomes visible on a small wooden table, illuminated by three lit white candles. To the left of the table is a wooden barrel with yellow paint markings, which the man breaks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot framing the character from the hip up follows them through a dark, dilapidated outdoor area at night, filled with debris, barrels, and broken wooden structures. The character moves through the ruins and opens a wooden door, revealing a small, dark room. The interior is illuminated solely by three lit candles on a small wooden table, which also holds a vintage black typewriter. After entering, the character turns and breaks a yellow-painted barrel.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a 3D game video. The camera follows the character\u2019s movements from behind. The character is shown in a medium shot, while the framing leaves more space to present a wide shot of the surrounding scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot that provides a wide view of the scene, a man is initially positioned in the bottom-left foreground, with a barrel to his immediate left and ruined structures in the middle ground to the right. The camera follows from behind at his level as he moves forward and to the right, crossing the foreground to approach a wooden door in the center middle ground. After opening the door and entering a dark room, a table holding a typewriter and candles appears in the right middle ground, while the man occupies the center-left. He then turns left, moving toward a yellow-painted barrel in the left middle ground, which he proceeds to break while the camera maintains its following perspective.",
