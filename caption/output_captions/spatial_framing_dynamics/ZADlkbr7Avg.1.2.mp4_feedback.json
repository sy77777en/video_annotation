    "pre_caption": "This video consists of a static, extreme wide scenery shot taken from a high-angle, overhead satellite perspective. The central area of the frame is occupied by Tokyo Bay, over which a large, dark, cross-shaped graphic is superimposed. The vertical element of this cross runs from the top to the bottom of the bay, while the horizontal element intersects it in the upper half. The bay is surrounded by a gray urban landscape that extends to the left, top, and bottom edges of the frame. On the right side of the frame, the urban area transitions into green, forested terrain. A larger body of open water is positioned in the bottom left, connected to the bay.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an expansive satellite scenery shot of a major coastal metropolis, identified as Tokyo Bay. The view captures the sprawling grey expanse of the city, contrasted with dark bodies of water and patches of green terrain. Dominating the center is a massive, dark, cross-shaped structure beneath the bay, suggesting a large-scale architectural or engineering plan. There is no main subject, as the shot's high-altitude perspective emphasizes the immense scale of the urban environment and the proposed megastructure within it, focusing on the overall geography and human impact rather than any individual element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An overhead satellite view captures Tokyo Bay, surrounded by a vast, gray urban sprawl. A large, dark, cross-shaped graphical display is visible beneath the area resembling water. The vertical band and its surrounding area have a dark, textured appearance, while the horizontal band does not. The intricate coastline is defined by numerous ports and reclaimed land. The dense city landscape transitions into green, forested areas further inland, primarily on the right side.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
