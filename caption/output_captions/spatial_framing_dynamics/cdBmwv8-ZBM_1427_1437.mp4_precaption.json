    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a third-person perspective, a man with short, blond hair is shown wearing a dark brown leather jacket with a light-colored shearling collar and cuffs. He walks through a dark, wooded area, passing an old, moss-covered truck partially obscured by tall grass. He then enters a dilapidated wooden structure and approaches a wooden crate with yellow and green markings. The man then smashes the crate, causing it to break apart into splinters and a cloud of dust.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot frames the character from the hip up as they navigate through a dark, foggy forest. The character walks along a damp, stone-paved path under a large, gnarled tree branch. Slightly to the right of the frame's center, an old truck, overgrown with moss and vegetation, sits in tall grass and eventually exits the frame on the right side as the camera moves. The character then moves left into a dilapidated wooden structure with collapsed walls and broken floorboards. Inside the ruin, the character approaches a natural wood-colored crate with yellow and green markings and smashes it, causing it to shatter into splinters and a cloud of dust.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a third-person game perspective. The camera follows the character's movement, showing them in a medium shot, while showing a wide shot of the scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a third-person perspective that maintains a medium shot of the main character and a wide shot of the scenery, the camera follows the man from behind at his level. Initially, the man is in the center foreground, walking along a path framed at the top of the shot by a large tree branch. A moss-covered truck sits in the middle ground, just right of center. As the man moves forward, the camera tracks him, causing the truck to shift to the right edge of the frame before exiting the view. Simultaneously, a dilapidated wooden structure in the left middle ground moves to occupy the center of the frame. The man then walks into the structure, positioning himself on the left side of the frame. He approaches a wooden crate located in the middle ground, slightly left of center, which becomes the central point of focus before he destroys it.",
