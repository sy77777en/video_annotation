    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a canted, top-down aerial cityscape shot of a dense, modern urban environment. The scene is characterized by the geometric patterns of white and light-grey buildings with flat rooftops, many of which are detailed with solar panels and large, circular ventilation systems. Dark asphalt streets are distinctly marked with clear white and yellow lines, along with prominent white zebra crossings, weaving between the structures and creating a stark contrast. There is no main subject, as the high-angle, wide perspective is used to emphasize the scale and intricate patterns of the urban grid. The focus is on the collective architectural environment and its impersonal atmosphere rather than any specific object or person.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a top-down, angled view of a dense, modern city during the daytime under bright sunlight. The scene is dominated by buildings with flat, light-gray and white rooftops, constructed in geometric, block-like shapes. Many of these rooftops are equipped with dark, rectangular solar panels and industrial HVAC systems. A prominent building on the left features a white, decorative lattice structure covering three large, circular fans. Dark asphalt roads with white and yellow markings, including three zebra crossings, weave between the structures, with a few vehicles visible. Small patches of green trees are situated at street level, and the entire composition is framed by black letterbox bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot captures a dense urban landscape with no primary subject. From a high-angle, canted top-down perspective, the camera looks down upon the city grid. A large building featuring three circular fans is positioned in the bottom left, adjacent to a multi-lane road that runs diagonally up the left side of the frame. Other streets weave through the center, separating geometric, flat-topped buildings that fill the center, top right, and bottom right areas. All elements are situated far below the camera, with the rooftops at a slightly higher plane than the streets, and the entire spatial composition remains static.",
