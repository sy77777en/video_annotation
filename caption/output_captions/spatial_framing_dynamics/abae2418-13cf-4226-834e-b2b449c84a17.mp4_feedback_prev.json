    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of scenery captured from a low-angle, worm's-eye perspective. The camera is positioned on the ground, looking directly up toward the sky, which occupies the center of the frame as the background element. The canopies of trees in the middle ground surround this central point, radiating outwards to the edges of the frame. The entire scene is in a constant, rapid rotation around the central axis, causing the trees to blur into radial streaks. This dynamic movement transforms the static elements into a vortex-like pattern, with the visual information converging at the center and blurring into concentric rings toward the periphery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a disorienting nature scenery shot, captured from a worm's eye view looking directly up through a canopy of trees toward the sky. The entire frame is in a rapid, continuous spin, which creates a powerful radial blur effect, transforming the individual trees into abstract streaks of green and brown that radiate from the center of the image. There is no main subject because the focus is placed entirely on the environmental effect and the dizzying, vertiginous atmosphere created by the camera's motion, rather than on any specific object within the forest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A worm's-eye view spins rapidly, creating a disorienting radial blur. The tall, dark trunks and foliage of the surrounding trees streak into a circular, vortex-like pattern against a pale, off-white sky. The colors throughout the scene are muted, dominated by earthy browns, dark greens, and the pale light from above. The continuous rotation blurs the environment into concentric rings of color and texture, with the tree canopies converging at the center of the spin.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
