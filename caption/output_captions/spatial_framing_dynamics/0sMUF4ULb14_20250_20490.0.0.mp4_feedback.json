    "pre_caption": "The video is presented in a full shot, with the camera positioned at the subjects' level. A model stands in the middle ground, slightly left of the frame's center, against a white cyclorama wall. In the foreground on the right, a photographer is initially bent over. The background on the right side of the frame contains dark walls and studio lighting equipment. As the clip progresses, the photographer stands up and takes a small step to his left, moving slightly closer to the center of the frame while remaining in the foreground. He then raises his hand to gesture at the model, who remains stationary in the middle ground. The \"AdoramaTV\" logo is a static overlay in the bottom right corner of the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a photo studio, a man with dark skin poses for a photoshoot. He is dressed in a white trench coat, a dark turtleneck, a silver chainmail-style skirt worn over white pants, and white sneakers. His face is partially obscured by horizontal bands of projected light. He holds a black fedora in his hands. A second man, the photographer, stands opposite him, wearing a yellow hoodie and dark pants. The photographer holds a camera and gestures with his hand, seemingly directing the model's pose.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a photography studio, characterized by a large, white cyclorama wall on the left that curves seamlessly into the floor. This bright area contrasts with the right side of the studio, which is dark with black walls and flooring. In this darker section, professional lighting equipment, including large light panels on tall stands and a small wheeled table, is visible. A strong light source casts a distinct shadow onto the white wall, and horizontal bands of light and shadow are projected across a person standing on the white background. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the white text \"AdoramaTV\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
