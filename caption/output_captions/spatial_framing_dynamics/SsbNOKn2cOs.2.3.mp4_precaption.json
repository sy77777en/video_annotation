    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, grey airplane wreckage hangs vertically, suspended by several steel cables, with its nose directed downward. The wreckage lacks any black markings on its side. At the upper end, two individuals, resembling special forces soldiers, are climbing along the edge, wearing gray helmets and dark work uniforms. Additionally, two other individuals in similar attire are positioned on the middle section of the wreckage, with one near an airplane window.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle aerial perspective, a large, gray section of an airplane fuselage hangs suspended vertically by cables over a vast, rugged landscape. The terrain below is a sprawling expanse of green and brown tundra, marked by rolling hills and dotted with small bodies of water that vary in color, appearing both dark and light. The fuselage, which has several square windows along its side, is occupied by a few figures in dark clothing clinging to its exterior. The scene is captured during the day under overcast lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, a large section of an airplane fuselage hangs vertically in the center of the frame and the middle ground, suspended by cables that extend down from the top of the frame. Four figures are positioned on the fuselage, also in the center and middle ground, with two near the top of the wreckage and two near its middle section. The entire background is filled with a vast, rugged landscape, featuring a small lake in the top left and another in the bottom right. The camera is positioned high above the subjects, looking down on the scene, which remains static throughout the shot.",
