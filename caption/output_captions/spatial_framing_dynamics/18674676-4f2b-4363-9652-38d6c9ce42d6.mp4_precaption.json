    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a light-skinned man with messy, wavy, blonde hair and blue eyes. Initially, his face is seen in a tight, soft-focus close-up, partially obscured by a dark, cylindrical object in front of his mouth. As the camera moves and the focus adjusts, more of his face comes into view, and his features become sharply clear from initially being out of focus, while the object shifts downward, likely resembling the bell of a megaphone.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This is a close-up shot set in an indoor environment against a plain, light-colored wall with panels of different colors. The scene is characterized by a very shallow depth of field. In the immediate foreground, the dark, circular rim of an object is out of focus. Positioned behind this object, a person with messy, wavy blond hair is initially entirely out of focus but later comes into sharp focus. The lighting is diffuse and even, and the entire scene has a soft, grainy texture.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a close-up shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The shot begins as an extreme close-up, with the dark, circular rim of an object positioned in the out-of-focus foreground at the bottom-left of the frame. A person's face is centered in the out-of-focus middle ground behind this object. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, then pulls focus to the person, bringing their face into sharp detail while the foreground object remains blurred. As the focus shifts, the foreground object moves downward, revealing more of the person's face and transitioning the shot into a clear close-up against a light-colored background.",
