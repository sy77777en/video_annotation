    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, platinum blonde hair is lying on her back on the leaf-strewn ground. She is wearing a dark, possibly black, jumpsuit with a choker. A figure dressed in a black long-sleeved shirt and black pants is kneeling on one knee, leaning down to place a hand on her neck and collar area in a restraining or choking motion.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place in a dense forest environment where the uneven ground is thickly covered with dry, light brown leaves, pine needles, and scattered twigs. Tall, dark tree trunks rise in both the midground and background, creating a natural environment under cool, diffuse lighting that suggests an overcast day or shaded conditions. From a level angle looking straight toward, a figure with long platinum blonde hair is seen lying supine and rolling on the forest floor, dressed in dark, utilitarian clothing. Standing beside them is a second individual wearing black pants and heavy boots. As the scene progresses, the standing figure bends down and firmly grasps the collar of the person rolling on the leaves, while the surrounding trees remain blurred. The color palette is muted, dominated by the earthy tones of the forest floor and the stark black of the subjects' attire.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot capturing a woman with platinum blonde hair lying supine on the leaf-strewn ground, positioned diagonally across the foreground from the center to the bottom right. Initially, the legs and boots of a second figure dressed in black are visible in the top left middle ground, standing over her. As the scene progresses, the standing figure kneels, shifting their position downwards into the top center of the frame. The camera, positioned at the level of the subject on the ground, captures the second figure leaning forward to place a hand on the woman's neck in the center foreground, while tall tree trunks remain blurred in the background.",
