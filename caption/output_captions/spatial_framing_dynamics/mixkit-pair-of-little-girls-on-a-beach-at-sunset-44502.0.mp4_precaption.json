    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with an extreme wide shot of a beach, initially lacking a distinct main subject. As the scene unfolds, two children enter the frame from the right, move to the center, pause briefly, and then exit to the right. Despite their presence, the focus remains on the expansive landscape, with the children occupying only a small portion of the frame. The video maintains a broad perspective, capturing the serene beach environment while subtly incorporating the transient movement of the children.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a tranquil beach scene at dusk, with gentle waves rolling onto a wide stretch of dark, wet sand. The sky is softly illuminated in shades of pale yellow and muted blue, gradually darkening toward the horizon where low, distant hills are visible. The shoreline curves gently, bordered by a line of palm trees on the right, their silhouettes faint against the fading light. Two children enter the scene from the right side of the frame, moving toward the center before exiting again to the right. The water reflects the subtle colors of the sky, and the surface of the sand glistens where it meets the receding tide. There are no overlays, text, or artificial elements present, and the environment remains calm and undisturbed throughout.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video captures an extreme wide shot of a beach. Initially, there are no people in the frame; then two children run into the shot\u2014their whole bodies are visible but they take up an extremely small proportion of the frame\u2014before finally running out of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: At the beginning, there is no subject. Once the two children appear, the camera remains at their height until they leave, and the camera height stays unchanged.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot of a beach, showing the shoreline stretching from the bottom right to the center and left of the frame, with the ocean occupying the left and middle ground, and the sky and distant hills forming the background across the top. Palm trees are visible along the far right edge in the background. Initially, there are no people present, and the entire scene is framed to emphasize the vastness of the landscape. Two children then enter from the right edge in the middle ground, moving toward the center of the frame while remaining small in scale relative to the overall scene. They pause briefly near the center, still in the middle ground, before continuing to the right and exiting the frame. Throughout, the camera remains at the children\u2019s height, maintaining a consistent perspective as they move, and the shot size and camera position do not change. The spatial arrangement keeps the children low and small within the frame, while the beach, ocean, and sky dominate the composition, reinforcing the sense of open space.",
