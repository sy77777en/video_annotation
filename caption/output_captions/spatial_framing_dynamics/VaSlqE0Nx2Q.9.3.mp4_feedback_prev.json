    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a shot focused on a rough, textured wall occupying the right side of the frame, with the rest of the frame showing a dark, out-of-focus background wall; both elements are positioned in the foreground and background, respectively, with no major subject visible. As the shot progresses, a young boy slowly emerges from behind the wall on the right, moving from the right edge toward the center of the frame. When fully revealed, the shot becomes a close-up of the boy, who is positioned centrally in the frame and in the foreground, with his head and upper torso visible. The background remains out of focus and occupies the middle ground and background, filling the rest of the frame behind the boy. The camera is at the boy\u2019s eye level throughout the reveal, maintaining a straight-on perspective as he moves into view. The spatial dynamic is defined by the boy\u2019s movement from the right foreground into the center foreground, with the textured wall shifting from a dominant foreground element to a partial frame edge as the boy becomes the primary subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a high-contrast, black-and-white revealing shot, a young boy slowly emerges from behind a rough, textured wall on the right. He has short, somewhat messy hair and is wearing a collared jacket with a visible texture, possibly corduroy. As he peeks into view, his hand rests on the edge of the wall. Strong lighting from the right illuminates the side of his face, highlighting his wide-eyed, upward gaze as he looks out with a curious expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, black-and-white scene, a young boy in a collared jacket peeks out from behind a rough-textured pillar on the right side of the frame. The setting is an enclosed, dimly lit space with uneven, dark walls. A single, strong light source from the right illuminates the side of the boy's face, casting the rest of the environment in deep shadow as he looks up and toward the left. The out-of-focus background wall has a mottled, uneven surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a close-up shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
