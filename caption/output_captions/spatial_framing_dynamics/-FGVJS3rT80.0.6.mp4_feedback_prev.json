    "pre_caption": "In this static wide shot, an astronaut is positioned in the center of the frame, crouched in the middle ground among a field of boulders. A large, curved piece of wreckage occupies the right foreground, positioned closer to the camera than the astronaut. Boulders are scattered across the foreground and middle ground, with a large rock formation filling the immediate bottom of the frame. In the background, distant mountains extend across the horizon under a sky with scattered clouds, where an orange lens flare is visible in the upper left-center. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down on the subject and the surrounding scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An astronaut, wearing a spacesuit with a white and dark color scheme and a large white and blue backpack-like life support system, is crouched among a field of large, dark-gray and brown boulders. The astronaut's helmet, which is predominantly not white, has a dark visor, concealing their face. To the right and behind the astronaut, closer to the camera, a large, curved, reddish-orange object, appearing to be a piece of wreckage, is partially buried in the sandy ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a vast and arid desert landscape, the scene is set during either sunrise or sunset, casting a warm, golden light over the terrain. The ground is a mix of sand and dirt, scattered with numerous large, rounded boulders. In the distance, a series of rolling hills and mountains are silhouetted against a pale sky with scattered clouds. A figure wearing a white and dark spacesuit is seen from behind, positioned amidst the rocks in the middle ground. A large, curved, reddish-brown object is partially visible in the right foreground, nestled among the stones. A prominent orange lens flare appears in the upper portion of the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
