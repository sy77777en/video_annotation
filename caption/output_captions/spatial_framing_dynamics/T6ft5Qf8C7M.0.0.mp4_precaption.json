    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a stationary point-of-view shot from the middle of a paved road at night. The road is marked with a solid white line on the left and a dashed yellow line in the center, with the headlights of an approaching car visible in the distance. To the right, a white wooden fence runs alongside the road, illuminated by several streetlights, while more distant lights and the faint silhouette of trees are visible against the dark sky. There is no main subject in this scene; the focus is instead on capturing the quiet, atmospheric experience of a nighttime setting. The stationary perspective emphasizes the environment and the serene ambiance rather than any specific entity within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor night scene shows a view down a paved, two-lane road marked with a solid white line on the left and a dashed yellow line in the center. To the right, a white fence runs alongside a sidewalk, while the left side of the road is shrouded in darkness, making it challenging to clearly identify the presence of dark trees. Various streetlights are visible, including an orange-hued light overhead and several blue-white lights in the distance. Far down the road, the headlights of an approaching vehicle can be seen. The scene is framed by black bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a stationary wide shot of a road at night, with the focus on the scenery rather than a specific subject. The camera is positioned at a low height, looking straight down the road which occupies the bottom and center of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background. A dashed yellow line runs down the center of the frame, receding into the distance, while a solid white line is visible on the bottom left. On the right side of the frame, a white fence stretches from the foreground into the middle ground. The headlights of a car are visible in the center background, approaching the camera. Several streetlights are positioned in the middle ground on the right, with another single light in the top center. The entire left side of the frame is occupied by darkness from the foreground to the background.",
