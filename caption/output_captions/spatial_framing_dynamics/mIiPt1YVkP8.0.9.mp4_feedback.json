    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a full shot of the \"PAL 115\" aircraft positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, situated on a taxiway marked by glowing green lines that extend from the foreground. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, then pans to the left. As it moves, the \"PAL 115\" aircraft shifts to the right side of the frame before exiting completely. Simultaneously, the \"UAL 863\" aircraft enters from the left, settling in the center of the frame in the middle ground. A third aircraft also enters from the left, becoming partially visible on the far left of the frame in the middle ground, resulting in a final wide shot of the two planes on the taxiway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays three gray, wide-body passenger airplanes on a taxiway at night. The first aircraft shown is a four-engine jet, identified by the glowing white text \"PAL 115\" floating above its fuselage. As the perspective shifts, the first aircraft moves out of the frame, allowing the second and third gray twin-engine aircraft to be fully revealed. Above their fuselages, illuminated white text markings are visible, reading \"UAL 863\" and \"UAL 1118,\" respectively.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a computer-animated scene set at night, the dark ground is marked with glowing green dashed lines that outline the paths. A grey, four-engine aircraft is situated on a curved section of the taxiway, with an illuminated white text overlay reading \"PAL 115\" hovering above it. As the view pans to the left, the aircraft exits the frame from the right side. Subsequently, a second and a third grey twin-engine aircraft enter the frame from the left side, each with illuminated white text overlays hovering above their fuselages: the second aircraft is labeled \"UAL 863\" and the third one is labeled \"UAL 1118.\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The scene begins with a single plane shown in a full shot. As the camera moves, two additional planes come into view, showing in a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
