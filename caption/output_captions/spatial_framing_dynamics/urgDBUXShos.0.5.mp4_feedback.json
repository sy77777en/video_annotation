The man holds a knife near the center of the frame, pressing it against the woman's cheek. The background is out of focus, containing blurred lights and the indistinct shapes of other people. As the man leans in, the woman turns her head away from him, briefly obscuring her face from view before he repositions her to face him again. The camera remains at the subjects' eye level, maintaining the close-up framing throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit setting, a man with white face paint, black makeup around his eyes, and a smeared red smile holds a woman. The man has greasy, medium-length, greenish-brown hair and wears a dark purple suit jacket. He is holding a small knife with a silver blade to the woman's cheek, while his other hand, clad in a dark purple leather glove, holds her cheek from the other side. The woman, who has brown hair styled in an updo and is wearing a dark green dress, looks at the man with a serious expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This scene takes place indoors at a moderately lit nighttime gathering. The background is dark and out of focus, with blurred lights and the indistinct shapes of other people extending into the midground, suggesting a large, populated room. The primary focus is on a man in a purple suit jacket and dark purple leather gloves holding a small, silver knife to a woman in a dark green dress. The camera remains close to the two central figures, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps the surrounding environment indistinct.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
