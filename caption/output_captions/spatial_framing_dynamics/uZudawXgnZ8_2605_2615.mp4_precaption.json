    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel-art scene of a farm, a character with light skin, wearing a red shirt and blue pants, briefly stands directly on top of a small, green-leafed tree sapling. The character, who has gray hair, then moves to a tilled plot of soil and uses a hoe, tilling the soil and causing small brown pixelated clods of earth to appear as he turns the soil. The scene also features a wooden farmhouse with a red roof and a small plot of land with green sprouts.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video in a 2D format showcases a pixel-art farm scene from a top-down or oblique top-down perspective, where the camera is positioned above the character and environment, looking downward to reveal mostly the tops of objects with limited sides. The outdoor setting features a blend of green grass and sandy soil, dotted with pine trees, deciduous trees, rocks, and logs. Centrally located is a small wooden farmhouse with a red roof and a smoking chimney, accompanied by another wooden building in the upper left. A wooden fence lines the right side of the property. Near the house, a rectangular plot of tilled soil with small green sprouts is arranged in a grid. A character wearing a red shirt and having gray hair is present on the farm. Overlays on the screen include a heads-up display in the top right corner showing the date, time in the morning, a sun icon for weather, and currency, while a toolbar at the bottom displays various tool icons.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot presents a pixel-art farm scene from a static, high-angle, top-down perspective. Initially, a character is positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, just below a wooden farmhouse. The character moves slightly down and left, briefly standing directly on top of a small tree sapling in the center of the frame. They then walk to the right, stopping beside a tilled plot of land located in the middle ground, to the right of the farmhouse. The character proceeds to use a hoe on the ground to the right of this plot, extending the tilled area. The scene is populated with trees, rocks, and grass in the foreground, middle ground, and background, with another building visible in the top-left background. A user interface with a clock and currency is fixed in the top-right corner, and a toolbar is at the bottom of the frame.",
