    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a top-down perspective, a convoy of vehicles is stationary along a straight road. In the center of the formation is a large, white semi-truck. It is surrounded by seven other vehicles: five dark green, military-style trucks are positioned in a staggered formation both in front of and behind the semi-truck, while a black car is at the front and another black car is at the rear. As the viewpoint zooms out, a bright blue, electric-like line shoots forward from the foremost dark green, military-style truck, extending far along the road. The five green military vehicles are momentarily highlighted with a white digital overlay.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye view, a convoy of vehicles is stationary on a straight, paved road cutting through a vast, arid desert landscape. The terrain is a light brown, sandy expanse with scattered dark patches. The convoy includes a central white semi-truck, several dark green military-style vehicles, and two black cars at the front and rear. A bright blue, electric-like line extends forward from the foremost dark green military-style truck, stretching far along the road. The five green military vehicles are momentarily highlighted with a white digital effect. There is a four-corner bracket in the center, with a larger four-corner bracket framing the entire scene. The smaller bracket is initially centered on the convoy, but its central point shifts as the camera pans left.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video simulates the perspective of a satellite camera and begins with a wide shot of a few vehicles. Then it gradually zooms out, showing an extremely wide view, and a line that looks like a blue electric current shooting out from one of the vehicles.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This video begins with a top-down wide shot, where a convoy of vehicles is positioned horizontally across the center of the frame on a road that bisects the scene. A white semi-truck is at the center of the formation, with several military-style vehicles and cars arranged to its left and right, all occupying the middle ground. The camera then zooms out to an extremely wide shot, causing the convoy to appear smaller while remaining in the center. As the zoom occurs, a bright blue line emanates from the front-most military vehicle and extends horizontally to the left, stretching far across the road. Simultaneously, the five green military vehicles are briefly highlighted with a white digital overlay. Throughout the shot, a large four-corner bracket frames the entire scene, while a smaller bracket is initially centered on the convoy. The camera is positioned directly above the scene.",
