    "pre_caption": "In an initial wide shot, a rocky cliff occupies the left side of the frame in the foreground and middle ground, with a group of people standing on its edge in the upper left. A diver is suspended in mid-air in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The camera, initially positioned below the diver, tracks their descent by panning down and to the right. The scene reframes to show the cliff on the left and the water filling the rest of the frame from the foreground to the background, where distant hills are visible. The shot concludes with a splash in the center-left of the frame as the diver enters the water, with the camera now positioned above the water's surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned person, likely a woman, wearing a swimsuit and a light-colored swimming cap, is captured mid-air in a feet-first dive. On the rocky cliff from which she jumped, a small group of people stands watching; this group includes a shirtless light-skinned man, a shirtless dark-skinned man, and other light-skinned individuals whose genders are difficult to determine due to distance and blurring. The diver then enters the water, creating a splash and disappearing from view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds at a rocky cliffside bordering a large body of water under an overcast sky. The tall, grey cliff is topped with green trees, and a few people are visible standing on its edge. A person is captured in mid-air, rotating and diving vertically towards the water. The view then shifts to show the splash as the person enters the water near the base of the cliff. In the distance, across the expansive body of water, lie tree-covered hills. A small, circular white watermark is present in the upper right corner.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: At the beginning of the video, several people can be seen standing on a cliff, along with one person diving off it into the water below. The camera follows the cliff diver, tracking their descent as they plunge into the water and disappear beneath the surface. It's overall a wide shot of the diver.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera starts below the subject, shifts above them as they jump into the water, and by the end of the video, the subject is no longer visible.",
