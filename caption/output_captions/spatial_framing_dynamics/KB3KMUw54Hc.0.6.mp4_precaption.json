    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A downward view into a dark, industrial elevator shaft reveals a robust metal framework at the top of the elevator cage, dividing it into two sections corresponding to the upper and lower portions of the frame. The cage is a boxy structure made of dark metal wire mesh. The surrounding shaft is a complex latticework of dark steel beams, chains, and perforated metal panels. The scene is dimly lit by lights on the surrounding walls, casting deep shadows and creating glints of light on the metallic surfaces, highlighting the gritty texture of the mechanical environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A view from above looks down into a dark, narrow, industrial shaft. In the center, a cage-like metal lift with mesh grating is dimly illuminated by warm light sources emanating from the surrounding walls. The robust metal framework at the top of the cage forms two sections, corresponding to the upper and lower parts of the frame. The surrounding walls of the shaft are dark, with sections of perforated metal and a thick chain visible on the right. The perspective slowly moves downward, revealing more of the grimy, metallic structure of the shaft and the lift within it.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot from a high angle, looking down into an industrial shaft. A metal elevator cage is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground, with the surrounding shaft walls visible on the left and right, extending into the background. The camera then slowly moves downward into the shaft. As it descends, the shot transitions to a wide shot, revealing more of the surrounding metallic structure and making the central cage appear smaller within the larger context of the shaft.",
