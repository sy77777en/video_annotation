    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a white skin tone, a dark mustache, and a beard stands on the left, facing forward. He wears a black beanie and is dressed in dark tactical gear, including a vest with pouches and a patch that reads \"G-25\" over a long-sleeved shirt. He later moves slightly, with his left arm crossing the center. To his left and slightly behind him stands a person with a light skin tone and short, likely light-colored hair, though the color is indistinct due to the backlight environment. This individual wears a light-colored, unbuttoned jacket over a dark base layer.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dark, expansive space, possibly a hangar or warehouse, where the air is hazy with smoke or dust. A single, intense white light source in the background provides strong backlighting, creating silhouettes and casting visible rays of light through the atmosphere. Two figures stand in front of the light source. The video is presented in a widescreen format with black bars at the top and bottom. An overlay of subtitles appears at the bottom of the screen, initially reading \"Price:\" in green and \"You speak for yourself.\" in white, then changing to \"Price:\" in green and \"Handing him over.\" in white.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a man is positioned in the left foreground, while a second person stands slightly behind him in the center-right middle ground. A single, bright light source is located in the upper-center background, backlighting both figures and creating silhouettes. The man on the left makes a slight movement, bringing his left arm across his body toward the center of the frame. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' level.",
