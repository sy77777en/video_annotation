    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot filmed at the subjects' level. In the center of the frame, a large white goat stands on a black metal ramp in the middle ground, with its rear to the camera. To its right, a smaller brown and black goat stands on the ground, also in the middle ground. On the left, a wooden chest and a small stool are positioned in the middle ground, and behind the stool, a turkey walks from right to left. The smaller goat takes a slight step forward toward a wooden shelving unit located in the center-right middle ground, while the white goat remains mostly stationary on the ramp. The entire scene is enclosed by a fence visible in the middle ground and background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, mostly white goat with a fluffy coat and a black patch on its rear stands on a black metal ramp, facing a hay rack with its short tail held upright. To its right, a smaller, pregnant-looking goat with a dark brown body and a black head and neck stands on the ground, also facing the hay rack. In the middle ground, a dark-feathered turkey walks on the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a sunlit, outdoor enclosure with a dark, solid floor, surrounded by a chain-link fence. Beyond the fence, the ground is covered in dry leaves, and trees are visible in the background. Within the enclosure, a large, light-colored wooden chest and a small wooden stool are positioned on the left. In the center, a black metal mesh ramp leads up to a platform in front of a wooden shelving unit holding black storage bins and a white container. A white goat stands on the ramp, while a smaller brown and black goat is on the ground to the right. A turkey is positioned in the middle ground near the stool.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
