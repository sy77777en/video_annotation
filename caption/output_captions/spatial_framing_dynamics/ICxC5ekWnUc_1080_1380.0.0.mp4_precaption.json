    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Cloud-like plumes of viscous magenta and white liquid billow towards the center from opposite sides of the frame. Initially, a small, dark, textured sphere is visible in the middle, but it is quickly enveloped as the two liquids converge and swirl together, creating marbled patterns. To the right, a small, spinning sphere resembling the planet Jupiter, with distinct orange and white bands, is also present.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a mesmerizing scene, vibrant magenta and opaque white ink clouds expand and swirl against a warm, orange-yellow backdrop. The two colors mix, creating marbled patterns of pink and white. Positioned between the two plumes is a small, dark, textured object. To the right, a small, out-of-focus sphere with brown and white bands, resembling a miniature planet, is visible.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a full shot of a ball centered in the frame, but it is soon submerged by red and white liquids and disappears from the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Due to the lack of background information, it is difficult to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a small, dark, textured sphere positioned in the center of the frame. A plume of magenta liquid enters from the left side, while a plume of white liquid enters from the right, both expanding from the edges toward the middle ground. The two liquids converge in the center, completely enveloping and obscuring the central sphere as they mix and swirl, eventually occupying the left and central areas of the frame. Throughout the shot, a small, out-of-focus, spinning sphere remains stationary on the right side of the frame, positioned slightly in the foreground relative to the central liquid interaction.",
