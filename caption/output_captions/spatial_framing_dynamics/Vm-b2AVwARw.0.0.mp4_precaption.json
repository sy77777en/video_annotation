    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases a vibrant cityscape, captured entirely in daylight. The scene features a sprawling, modern metropolis filled with numerous skyscrapers under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. Among the buildings, a standout structure is a tall, slender, futuristic tower with a glowing turquoise, semi-transparent appearance and a ring-like feature at its apex. Positioned behind and to the right of this tower is an exceptionally tall, dark skyscraper. The focus is on conveying the grand scale and futuristic atmosphere of the entire urban environment, emphasizing the vastness and architectural ambition of the city itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene opens with an aerial view of a digitally rendered city, captured from a downward angle, which initially appears shaded and relatively dark. The cityscape is composed of numerous dark, blocky skyscrapers set against a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. A central, futuristic skyscraper stands out with a translucent, glowing blue-green digital outline, featuring a tapered cylindrical form and a ring-like structure at its peak. In the midground, a striking landmark shaped like a sharp needle is prominently set against the sky. An overlay appears in the upper right corner with white text on a transparent black background, reading: \"Animations are for illustrative purposes only. The final build may differ.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot of a digitally rendered cityscape. The scene opens with an extreme wide, high-angle shot looking down on a dark city, with a large building in the foreground at the bottom and a glowing skyscraper outline in the center-background. The camera then moves forward and tilts upward, transitioning to a low-angle perspective from within the city as the scene brightens to daylight. In the final frame, the glowing futuristic tower is positioned in the center-middle ground, flanked by other skyscrapers. A very tall, dark skyscraper stands to its right in the mid-to-background. Darker buildings frame the view from the foreground at the bottom and sides, with the sky occupying the top half of the frame. A text overlay is visible in the top right corner.",
