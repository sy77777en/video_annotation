    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a nature scenery shot captured from within a canyon, looking up towards the sky. The view is framed by the dark, craggy silhouettes of massive reddish-brown rock formations that rise up on both sides, with a sliver of pale blue sky visible between them. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to emphasize the natural environment and create a specific atmosphere. The focus is on the stark contrast between the enclosed, textured rock and the open, smooth sky, highlighting the scale of the landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A worm's-eye view from within a narrow canyon looks up toward the sky. On either side, the jagged silhouettes of large, reddish-brown rock formations rise, their rough, textured surfaces cast in deep shadow. A small glint of sunlight touches the edge of the left rock face. Between the canyon walls, a patch of light blue sky is visible, with a single, small white cloud. The scene is entirely still.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of scenery captured from a low-angle perspective, looking up from inside a canyon. There is no main subject. The dark silhouettes of the canyon walls are in the foreground, framing the scene on the left and right sides and extending from the bottom of the frame. In the background, a section of light blue sky is visible in the center of the frame between the rock formations. A small, lone cloud is positioned in the upper right-center of the sky, also in the background. The camera and all elements within the scene remain completely still.",
