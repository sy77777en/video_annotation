    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video shows the arms and hands of a fair-skinned person sitting at a light wood-grain desk in a dimly lit room. The person's left hand is on a dark keyboard, and their right hand operates a matching mouse. In front of the person is a large computer monitor displaying a dark user interface with green and white elements. The main focus is a black, box-shaped, small form factor computer case on the right side of the desk. The case is open, with its top panel removed, revealing its internal components, which include a hard drive, a motherboard with a small fan, and various wires. To the right of this open case sits a small black electronic device with an antenna, connected by thin red and black wires to something off-screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a softly lit bedroom with a neatly made bed featuring blue and white striped bedding against the back wall. A wooden desk with a light finish occupies the foreground, supporting a computer monitor displaying a dark interface with white and red text, as well as a compact, open electronic device with visible circuit boards, wires, and a metallic casing. A keyboard and mouse are positioned on the desk, and a hand is seen operating the mouse. The room\u2019s floor is a light wood, and the overall color palette is cool with blue and purple tones. Overlay elements include a small, semi-transparent icon in the lower left corner and a faint border around the video, indicating these are not part of the physical scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video frames a person at a table with a desktop computer. Only the right half of the computer and table is visible, with the focus primarily on a computer tower-like object on the table\u2019s right side.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This static, high-angle medium shot frames a person at a desk, with the camera positioned above them. The person's arms and hands occupy the foreground at the bottom left, positioned over a keyboard and mouse. A large computer monitor is situated on the left side of the frame in the middle ground. The central focus is an open computer case, which sits in the center-right of the frame, also in the middle ground. To the right of the case, another small electronic device rests on the desk. The desk itself extends from the foreground into the middle ground. In the background, a bed is visible in the upper right portion of the scene.",
