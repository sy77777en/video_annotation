    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, rocket-shaped drone stands vertically on a paved surface. The drone has a black, twisted, fin-like base that supports a central body. The upper part of the body is a smooth, white, bullet-shaped nose cone. Extending horizontally from the body are two black arms, each holding a downward-facing, three-bladed propeller. The black components of the drone have a matte, textured appearance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The camera is positioned at ground level, maintaining a level angle along the length of an open asphalt road. Metal guardrails line both sides of the road, which extends into the distance against a wide-open suburban landscape featuring sparse trees, grass, and a cloudy sky. In the center of the road sits a small, stationary object resembling a rocket. It has a white, bullet-shaped nose cone atop a black, finned body, with two black pods containing propellers extending from its sides. Above the drone, an overlay displays the white text \"PROTOTYPE DRONE 1,\" with two red, downward-pointing triangular icons positioned below, pointing to the drone.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a small drone positioned in the center foreground on an asphalt road. The road extends from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground, flanked by guardrails on the left and right that recede into the background landscape. The shot then pulls back into a wide shot, causing the drone to appear smaller and shift into the middle ground while remaining in the center of the frame. As this happens, two red triangular icons appear in the top center, pointing down at the drone. The camera is positioned at a low angle, level with the drone on the ground throughout the clip.",
