    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide, low-angle scenery shot of a fantasy-industrial structure. Initially, the frame shows a stone tower on the left and another on the right, both in the middle ground, connected by a large red pipe running horizontally across the center. A glass roof is visible in the background at the top of the frame, with various machinery in the foreground at the bottom. The camera then pans from right to left while tilting slightly upward. This movement reveals a tall, red-and-white spiraling tower in the background, moving it toward the center of the frame, and brings a complex network of colorful pipes into view in the middle ground on the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases an architectural marvel that begins with a stone foundation adorned with simple gears and pipework. As the camera pans, the building appears to magically construct itself, suggesting a dynamic creation process. The structure features crenelated towers and large, arched windows beneath a massive, arched glass roof. A vibrant network of brightly colored pipes in red, yellow, purple, teal, and green crisscrosses the exterior, running both horizontally and vertically. Some pipes integrate inward, forming industrial cylindrical structures, while others extend along the outer walls, contributing to the building's gradual transformation. One prominent tower is painted with a red and white spiral, reminiscent of a candy cane. The sweeping camera motion highlights the grand scale and imaginative design, blending historical architecture with vibrant, industrial fantasy elements to establish a unique and wondrous atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins with a building that initially features only a stone foundation with simple gears and pipework. As the camera pans, the building appears to magically construct itself, with elements being added progressively. A vast, curved glass roof covers part of the structure, and a complex network of large, brightly colored pipes in shades of red, yellow, purple, and green runs along the walls and through the space. In the middle ground, two tall, spiraling towers with a red and white candy-cane pattern are visible. The foreground is filled with various pieces of steampunk-style machinery, including wheels, gears, and copper-colored vats. The sun is low in the sky, creating a bright, hazy glare.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
