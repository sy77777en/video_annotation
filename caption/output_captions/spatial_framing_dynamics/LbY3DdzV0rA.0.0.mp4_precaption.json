    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a massive dust storm, known as a haboob, as it advances across a desert. The focus is on the immense scale and powerful atmosphere of the natural event rather than a specific object. A towering, opaque wall of tan-colored dust dominates the view, rolling over a flat expanse dotted with saguaro cacti and sparse green shrubs. Above this phenomenon, the sky is split between dark, turbulent storm clouds on one side and a patch of clear blue with white clouds on the other, highlighting the storm's leading edge.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A massive, towering wall of tan dust advances across a vast desert landscape under a dramatic sky. The desert floor is an arid, flat plain dotted with green shrubs and numerous saguaro cacti. Above the immense dust cloud, the sky is split; one side is filled with dark, turbulent, purplish-gray storm clouds, while the other reveals a patch of blue sky with white, fluffy clouds. The scene captures the immense scale of the weather phenomenon as it moves over the sparse desert vegetation.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a desert landscape. The desert floor, dotted with cacti and shrubs, occupies the bottom third of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the middle ground. A massive wall of tan dust is positioned in the middle ground, extending horizontally across the entire frame and rising to fill the center. In the background, the sky occupies the top of the frame, with dark storm clouds on the top left and a section of blue sky with white clouds on the top right. The camera is positioned at an elevated height, looking out over the scenery, and performs a very slow, subtle push-in toward the advancing dust storm.",
