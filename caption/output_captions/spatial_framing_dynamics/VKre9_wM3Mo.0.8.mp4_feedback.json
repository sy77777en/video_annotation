    "pre_caption": "A webpage is shown from a high, angled perspective, occupying the entire frame. In the foreground, the main title, \"8-week career planning course: career planning template,\" is positioned in the center. Below the title, on the center-left, are the author's byline and a row of social media buttons. At the top of the frame, the website's header is visible. All these text elements are layered over a blue blueprint-style background image. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly zooms out and pans slightly to the right, gradually revealing more of the webpage on the right and bottom edges of the frame. This movement causes the elements to appear smaller and shift their position slightly toward the top-left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up, angled view of a webpage from the website \"80,000 HOURS\" is displayed. The main focus is on the article title, \"8-week career planning course: career planning template,\" which is presented in large, bold, black text highlighted with white banners. This title is set against a blue background image that resembles a blueprint, featuring white lines, circles, and geometric shapes. Below the title, the author and publication date, \"By Arden Koehler \u00b7 Published May 2021,\" are shown in white text on a dark gray banner. A row of social media and action buttons, including \"LIKE,\" \"TWEET,\" \"SHARE,\" \"EMAIL,\" \"SAVE TO POCKET,\" and \"PRINT,\" is situated beneath the author's name. The top of the webpage features a white header with the site's logo and navigation links such as \"Start here,\" \"Career guide,\" and \"Research.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A webpage from the \"80000 HOURS\" website is shown from a slightly angled perspective. The background of the page is a solid blue with white, sketch-like lines and geometric shapes, resembling a blueprint. Overlaid on this background, the main title, \"8-week career planning course: career planning template,\" is displayed in large, bold, black text. Below the title, a dark overlay box contains the byline \"By Arden Koehler \u00b7 Published May 2021.\" Further down, a row of social media and action buttons includes options like \"LIKE,\" \"TWEET,\" \"SHARE,\" \"EMAIL,\" \"SAVE TO POCKET,\" and \"PRINT.\" At the top of the screen, the website's header and navigation menu are visible against a white background. An overlay in the top right corner of the video reads \"[AD].\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
