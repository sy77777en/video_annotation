    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, abstract figure composed of black outlines is visible. The figure appears to be riding a single-wheeled vehicle. It has a small, round head with a single black dot for an eye and a black-and-white hat topped with a small black dot. The body is a simple black outline, and the vehicle consists of a spoked wheel and a fragmented frame. Near the character's body, there are three small squares in blue, black, and orange. A solid black line also appears, extending from the top of the scene downwards and curving slightly at its lower end.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video, the scene is set against a plain, light gray background. At the beginning, a solid black line extends downward from the top of the frame and exits from the upper part. Subsequently, several solid black lines enter the frame sequentially from the bottom and right side, eventually exiting in the opposite direction. A black number \"46\" emerges from the bottom, ascends, and then slides out of the frame. By the end of the video, a solid black line is positioned in the left-center of the frame with a slight curve. A small, abstract figure, rendered in black outlines, is accompanied by three small squares in blue, black, and orange positioned near its body, following the path created by the lines.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
