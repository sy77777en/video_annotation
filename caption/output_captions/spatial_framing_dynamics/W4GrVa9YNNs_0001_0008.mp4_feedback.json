    "pre_caption": "This scenery shot begins with a close-up perspective, where yellow flowers in the foreground occupy the lower half of the frame in sharp focus. A white fence is positioned horizontally across the middle ground, and a brown barn is visible in the background in the upper half of the frame; both are initially blurry. The camera remains stationary as the focus shifts from the foreground flowers to the background elements. As a result, the flowers become out of focus, while the middle-ground fence and the background barn become sharp and clear. Towards the end of this focus pull, white text appears in the bottom-left corner of the frame. The camera is positioned at approximately the height of the flowers throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a tranquil rural scenery shot, characterized by a sunlit patch of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with dark centers in the foreground. Beyond the flowers, a white rail fence extends across a grassy field, with a large, brown wooden barn situated in the background. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the environment and the demonstration of a camera technique. The shot begins with the flowers in sharp detail and then shifts focus to the barn, intentionally guiding the viewer's attention through the depth of the scene rather than centering on one particular element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunny, outdoor setting, a cluster of yellow Black-eyed Susans with dark brown centers sways in the foreground. Behind the flowers, a white, multi-railed fence stretches across a grassy field. In the background stands a large, brown wooden barn with a gray shingled roof. The scene's focus shifts from the sharply detailed flowers to the previously blurry barn and fence, bringing them into clear view. An overlay of white text appears in the lower-left corner, reading, \"What is Rack Focus?\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",
