    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel-art farm scene, a structure in the lower-left appears to be under construction or in a state of ruin, featuring a gray concrete foundation with exposed brown and gray pipes and surrounded by a wooden frame. A light purple butterfly is visible on this concrete slab. A character with gray hair, a red shirt, and blue pants is present on the farm. The scene also includes a wooden farmhouse with a red roof and a smaller, separate wooden building, likely a chicken coop, in front of which a red heart icon briefly appears above a chick. The environment consists of numerous green trees, a river with a waterfall, and a small tilled garden plot with green sprouts. On-screen indicators in the corners display the time and date, and a red \"Out of water\" message appears momentarily, while a toolbar at the bottom shows various tools.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with an oblique top-down view captures a pixel-art farm scene during the early morning. The outdoor environment features a wooden farmhouse with a red roof and a smaller building with a khaki roof and green walls, with hay bales located in its yard. To the left, a river with a waterfall flows, and a dilapidated structure is under construction. The landscape is a mix of green grass and sandy dirt, populated by numerous green trees, some with pink blossoms, and patches of blue-leafed bushes. A small, tilled garden plot with green sprouts is visible, and a character with grey hair and a red shirt walks across the farm. An overlay in the top-right corner displays the time, date, weather, and currency. At the bottom, a toolbar shows icons for various tools, and a temporary text box in the lower-left corner reads \"Out of water.\" Multiple butterflies, in shades of purple and light purple, flutter through the scene, and a red heart icon briefly appears above the head of one of the chicks.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot from a high, oblique top-down perspective, a pixel-art farm is displayed. Initially, a character stands in the center-left of the frame in the middle ground, with a farmhouse to their right in the middle ground and a tilled garden plot in the bottom-right foreground. A structure under construction is in the bottom-left foreground, while a coop is located in the top-left middle ground, next to a river that flows down the left side of the scene. The character walks from their central position up and to the left, moving toward the coop. The camera pans slightly up and to the left to follow the character's movement. As they near the coop, a red heart icon appears above a chick in the top-left. Throughout the scene, butterflies flutter in the foreground and middle ground, and static UI elements remain in the top-right and bottom of the frame.",
