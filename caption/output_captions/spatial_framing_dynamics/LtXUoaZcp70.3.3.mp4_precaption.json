    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a digitally rendered scene on a gridded floor, four figures resembling men in military uniforms are gathered around a clothing rack. In the foreground, a man rendered in a red, dot-like texture wears a long coat and a cap, standing with his back mostly to the viewer and gesturing toward the others. He faces a man rendered in solid blue, who stands with one hand on his hip. Between and behind them is a clothing rack, rendered in a white, dot-like texture, holding numerous white, dot-like texture shirts on hangers. Two other men, rendered in a red and white dot-like texture, interact with the display; the man on the left adjusts a garment on the rack, while the man on the right holds a folded piece of clothing. Several pairs of white wireframe boots are arranged on the floor beneath the rack.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, abstract space with a black background, four figures stand on a dark, textured floor marked with a white grid. In the center is a clothing rack rendered in a white, dot-like style, holding several similarly styled shirts on hangers. Beneath the rack, several pairs of boots are depicted in the same white, dot-like fashion. To the left stands a solid red figure in a long coat and cap. To the right is a solid blue figure. Between and behind them, two other figures rendered in a red and white point-cloud style interact with the clothing rack. An overlay of white text at the bottom of the screen provides a caption with the reference \"[36,37,38].\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is captured in a static wide shot from a high angle, looking down upon the subjects on a gridded floor. A red figure is positioned in the foreground at the bottom left. In the middle ground, a blue figure stands on the right side of the frame. A clothing rack occupies the center of the middle ground, flanked by two dot-textured figures. One of these figures is to the left of the rack, and the other is to its right. Several pairs of wireframe boots are arranged on the floor in the middle ground, directly beneath the rack. The spatial composition of the scene remains unchanged throughout the clip.",
