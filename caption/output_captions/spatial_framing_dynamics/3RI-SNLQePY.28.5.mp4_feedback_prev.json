    "pre_caption": "A static, eye-level shot frames a hand-drawn chart, which is centered in the frame and occupies the middle ground. This chart hangs from a brown rod at the top of the frame against a plain gray background wall. In the foreground, a light brown surface spans the bottom of the frame, featuring icons of books and a backpack in the bottom-left corner. A gray triangular icon is also present in the foreground at the top-left corner of the screen. The only movement comes from a white, arrow-shaped cursor, a foreground element, which starts near the top-left, moves to the center-right to point at symbols on the chart, and then returns to the top-left of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A hand-drawn chart on light-colored paper hangs from a brown wooden rod against a plain gray wall. The chart is divided into rows, each featuring a unique, abstract, black-ink symbol on the left and a corresponding sequence of pictographs on the right. The abstract symbols are geometric, including shapes like an inverted U, a crescent, and various triangular and linear forms. The pictographs depict natural items such as a tooth, a ladybug, an acorn, a crescent moon, and a spider. A white, arrow-shaped cursor is moving across the screen. In the bottom left corner of the scene, small icons of books and a backpack are present on a light brown surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A screen recording of a software or system interface shows a 2D animated scene, centered on a large, off-white chart hanging from a brown rod against a light gray wall. The chart displays a key or legend with two columns of black line drawings. The left column contains abstract, runic-like symbols, while the right column features small illustrations of objects, including teeth, ladybugs, acorns, crescent moons, and spiders. Below the chart, a brown item bar is visible at the bottom of the screen, featuring an icon resembling a stack of books and a brown backpack icon in the bottom left corner. Overlaying the scene is a white, triangular mouse cursor that moves across the chart, pointing at the various symbols. A gray triangular icon is visible in the top left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
