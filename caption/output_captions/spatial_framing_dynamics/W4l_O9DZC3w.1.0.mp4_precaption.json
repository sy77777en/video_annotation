    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a dark-skinned woman with long, dark hair styled into a small bun at the back of her head, who is jumping rope. She is wearing a yellow and white slip dress over bright red tight pants and yellow slip-on shoes. In the background, several other people are visible on playground equipment. On the right side, one individual is sitting atop a blue geodesic dome climber, while another is sitting at the bottom. The scene also includes a swing set with two animal-shaped seats, a blue and orange merry-go-round, and a small slide, all situated in a dry, grassy field.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in an outdoor playground located in a vast, hilly landscape covered with dry, yellow-brown grass. In the background, rolling hills extend towards the horizon under a cloudy, overcast sky, with a single dark tree visible on one of the slopes. The playground equipment includes a swing set with yellow and blue animal-shaped spring riders, a central merry-go-round with blue and orange-red components, a simple metal slide, and a blue geodesic climbing dome. A person is jumping rope in the foreground amidst the dry grass, while two individuals are positioned on the climbing dome in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a woman jumps rope in the center of the frame and the middle ground. To her left, also in the middle ground, is a swing set with two spring riders. To her right in the middle ground are a merry-go-round and a small slide. Further back, in the right background, two other people are on a geodesic dome climber. The scene is set against a background of rolling, grassy hills that occupy the upper half of the frame, with a lone tree on a hill in the left-center background. Dry grass fills the foreground and extends into the middle ground. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level.",
