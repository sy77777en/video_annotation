    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated man with an atypically large, round face and yellowish skin is shown from the neck up. His face is characterized by heavy, sagging jowls that droop down on either side of his slightly open mouth. He has a small, straight nose and small, wide-set eyes with a pink color at the bottom. Dark, shadowed lines define his jowls and the area under his eyes. In the foreground, a bright yellow piece of fabric is draped, featuring stylized red, flame-like patterns and wavy, light blue lines, which eventually go out of view from the bottom as the camera moves.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In this animated scene, the lower half of a large, pale-skinned man's face is set against a dark teal background. The man's face, illuminated by a yellow light from below, shows his eyes widening in a moment of realization. In the foreground, a bright yellow cloth decorated with red, flame-like designs and blue, wavy lines partially obscures his chin and completely obscures his neck. As the scene progresses, the fabric moves out of view from the bottom, revealing more of the man's face. The entire composition is framed by dark, textured letterbox bars at the top and bottom.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.",
