    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a person seen from behind, running away from the camera. They are wearing a bright red, long-sleeved coat over a dark, long dress. They are running with two other individuals in a desolate, muddy area. To the left and slightly ahead of the main subject, a person in a long, dark coat walks or runs forward. To the right of the main subject, another person in a dark overcoat is pushing a wheelchair with someone seated in it. Initially, this individual is positioned closer to the front-left of the main subject, but as they move, the person transitions to the front-right of the main subject. Between the figures, in the midground, is a dark, wrecked car with a smashed front end and a caved-in hood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a desolate, industrial area under a foggy, overcast sky. A muddy, debris-strewn path extends from the lower-middle foreground to the middle-right background of the frame, where three figures are seen running away from the camera toward a large, multi-story industrial building on the left side of the path. To the left of this building, an arched gateway is part of a smaller structure with a sign that reads \"BEXHILL WATER AUTHORITY.\" The environment is littered with debris, and two wrecked, burnt-out cars are abandoned along the path. The entire scene is rendered in a desaturated, greenish-blue color palette, with the exception of a red jacket worn by one of the figures.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a person in a red coat \u0938\u092c\u094d\u091c\u0947\u0915\u094d\u091f is positioned in the center-right foreground, running away from the camera. Two other individuals are slightly ahead in the middle ground, one to the left and one to the right of the main subject. A wrecked car is situated in the center-left middle ground, between the figures, while a large industrial building occupies the center and left middle ground. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, follows from behind, maintaining a relatively stable distance as the group moves away from the foreground and deeper into the scene along a muddy path.",
