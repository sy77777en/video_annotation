    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot captured from a low-angle, worm's-eye perspective looking directly up. The canopies of several tall trees with yellow-green leaves are positioned around the perimeter of the frame\u2014at the top, bottom, left, and right\u2014framing the clear blue sky, which occupies the center of the frame in the background. The entire scene is in motion as the frame rotates clockwise, causing the trees to appear to spin around the central sky and creating a slight motion blur on the foliage.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a nature scenery shot capturing a worm's-eye view of several tall trees with dense, yellow-green foliage reaching towards a clear, deep blue sky. There is no single main subject as the composition emphasizes the immersive environmental experience and the grand scale of the forest canopy. The focus is on creating an atmospheric view rather than highlighting a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a worm's-eye view looking directly up, the canopies of several tall trees with yellow-green leaves are seen against a clear, bright blue sky. The scene is in motion, creating a sense of movement as the camera rolls clockwise, causing the foliage to exhibit a slight blur. The canopies of the trees frame the sky during the daytime.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
