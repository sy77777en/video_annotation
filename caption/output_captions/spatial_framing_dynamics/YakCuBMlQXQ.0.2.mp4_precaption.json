    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the foreground, a person lies on the ground, with their legs clad in dark blue trousers and white sneakers visible. A man dressed entirely in black walks forward from the middle ground. He wears black combat boots, black pants with a thigh holster on his right leg, a black coat over a black shirt, and black leather gloves. He holds a silver handgun in his right hand. As his upper body is revealed, he is shown to be a man with a short, dark beard and dark hair, wearing black sunglasses. In the background, another man stands, wearing a black short-sleeved shirt and a black tactical vest. Additionally, a woman with a long ponytail is kneeling, wearing a white vest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a wooded area during the day, the ground is covered with dirt, pine needles, and fallen leaves among tall, slender trees. The light is dim and overcast. A figure dressed in a black coat, black pants, and black combat boots stands in the scene, holding a silver handgun. In the background, another person in black tactical gear is visible between the trees, alongside a kneeling woman with a long ponytail, wearing a white vest. On the forest floor in the foreground, the legs of a person wearing dark blue trousers and white sneakers are visible. The color palette is muted, consisting primarily of blacks, greys, and the earthy tones of the forest.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video takes place in a forest scene. Initially, a person lying on the ground is visible in the foreground, with only part of their legs and hands showing. In the middle ground, a person in black walks toward the camera, with only his feet and part of his legs visible. As the camera tilts upward, the person's body is gradually revealed, and the shot ends with a medium close-up of this person's upper body.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle shot, showing the legs and white sneakers of a person lying on the ground in the bottom foreground. In the center middle ground, the lower legs and black boots of a standing figure are visible. As this central figure walks forward, the camera tilts upward, following their movement and revealing more of their body. The shot transitions into a medium close-up, with the man in the black coat now positioned in the center-left of the frame, while another person in tactical gear remains in the right background. The person on the ground is no longer in view by the end of the shot, and the camera concludes at the standing subject's level.",
