    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features several abstract, translucent figures against a black background. The most prominent subject is a large, red, human-like head and torso with glowing yellow eyes and intricate concentric circle patterns on its face and chin. To its right is a smaller, green, translucent figure resembling a head in profile. Initially, on the far left side of the frame, there are irregular red and yellow textures that eventually disappear, giving way to a blurry, orange-yellow figure in the shape of a full-bodied woman. This silhouette transforms into a background outline that recedes into the distance. The green head-like figure transforms into a small, green, translucent, fetus-like shape contained within a red circular outline, which disappears at the end, leaving only the red circular outline behind. Concurrently, the facial details of the central red figure fade, and it appears to turn, showing the back of its head and shoulders.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a black, featureless space, a large, translucent red figure with an elongated head and glowing yellow, concentric-ringed eyes is centrally positioned. Its face is marked with swirling patterns. On the right side of the frame, a smaller, glowing green figure is visible in profile. The scene shifts to include a glowing yellow-orange female form on the left, which gradually turns to a back view and diminishes as it moves into the distance. On the right, a small, green, fetal shape is enclosed within a red, circular form that slowly contracts, causing the green shape to shrink progressively until it disappears entirely, all set against the dark background.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is abstract. At the start of the frame, two abstract shapes resembling close-ups of human faces appear; soon after, the green \"face\" transforms into other shapes, while the red human-like figure in the middle seems to turn around, forming a close-up shot with its back to the camera.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a close-up on a large, red, human-like figure occupying the center of the frame in the middle ground. To its right, a smaller green figure is also positioned in the middle ground, while abstract red and yellow textures are visible in the foreground on the far left. The textures on the left are soon replaced by a blurry, orange-yellow female silhouette that appears on the left side of the frame. This silhouette then turns and recedes into the background, diminishing in size. Concurrently, the green figure on the right transforms into a small, green, fetus-like shape contained within a red circular outline, which remains in the middle ground on the right side. This circular element contracts, causing the green shape inside to shrink until it vanishes. Throughout these changes, the central red figure turns in place, transitioning from a frontal view to a close-up of the back of its head and shoulders while maintaining its central position in the frame.",
