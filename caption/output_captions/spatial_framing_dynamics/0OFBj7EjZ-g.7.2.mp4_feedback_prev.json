    "pre_caption": "In this close-up shot, a cracked, semi-transparent object occupies the right foreground. In the bottom-left foreground, a silver hammer head and a thin metal rod are partially visible, while colorful spheres and sticks rest in the top-left background. As the camera, positioned at the subject's level, moves forward and pans slightly to the right, the hammer and rod exit the frame from the bottom left. Concurrently, the spheres and sticks in the background shift into the middle ground before also exiting the frame from the left, leaving the cracked object as the primary focus on the right side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up view shows a semi-transparent object occupying the center and right, with several prominent cracks running along its surface. In the blurred background to the left, small, brightly colored spheres in green, blue, or pink, some connected with sticks, rest on a dark gray surface marked with thin red and white lines. As the camera moves, the spheres and sticks shift to the midground before exiting the frame from the left. In the first part of the video, in the lower left, the silver-colored head of a small hammer is partially visible, along with a thin metal rod resembling a nail that points toward the cracked object in the lower center.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a close-up shot, a semi-transparent, curved surface with several cracks is the central focus. The camera moves and pans, bringing the details of the fractures into view. In the blurred background to the left, small, brightly colored spheres in green, blue, or pink, some connected with sticks, rest on a dark gray surface marked with thin red and white lines. As the camera moves, the spheres and sticks shift to the midground before exiting the frame from the left. In the lower left, the silver-colored head of a small hammer is partially visible, along with a thin metal rod resembling a nail that points toward the cracked object in the lower center. Later, they both exit the frame as the camera moves.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
