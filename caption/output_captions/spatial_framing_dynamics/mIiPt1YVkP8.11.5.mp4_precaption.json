    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a computer-generated simulation of an airport scene, showcasing a vast, empty airfield at either dawn or dusk. Multiple runways and taxiways stretch across the frame under a hazy, reddish-purple sky, where a single, bright sun hangs low on the horizon. The focus is on the expansive scale of the man-made landscape and the tranquil, atmospheric lighting of the early morning or late evening.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This video shows a computer-animated view of an airport at either sunrise or sunset. The sky is a hazy, reddish-purple, with a single, bright, circular sun low on the horizon. The landscape features a wide expanse of dark brown land with off-white or light brown runways and taxiways, interspersed with patches of green grass. In the distance, the faint outlines of simple, blocky buildings are visible. An overlay is present at the bottom of the screen, featuring a black bar with text in a typewriter-style font. This text displays a transcript of an air traffic control communication, starting with \"AUS TWR:\" in yellow, followed by a message in white that reads, \"Fedex 1432 heavy, roger, sir, you have our apologies, we appreciate your professionalism.\" It then changes to a response from \"FDX1432:\" in orange, followed by \"Thank you.\" in white.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This static video presents an extreme wide shot of a computer-generated airport scene from a high-angle perspective. The expansive network of runways and taxiways fills the foreground and middle ground, stretching from the bottom of the frame towards the horizon. In the background, a bright sun is positioned in the top left, while the faint silhouettes of buildings are visible across the distant landscape. A text overlay remains fixed in the foreground at the bottom of the screen. There is no movement of the camera or any elements within the scene.",
