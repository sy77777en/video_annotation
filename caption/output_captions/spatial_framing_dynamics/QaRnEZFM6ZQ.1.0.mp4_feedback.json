    "pre_caption": "The shot opens with a young woman's head positioned at the bottom center of the frame. Tall reeds occupy the foreground on the bottom left and bottom right, extending into the midground and flanking her. In the background, a large, black, star-like symbol is painted on a surface in the center of the frame, with a white radiator visible in the midground to the left. The camera, initially positioned above the woman, moves downward, causing her head to shift from the bottom center toward the center of the frame as it is revealed she is in water. The shot concludes with the camera at the woman's eye level, where her head remains a small element in the center of the frame, framed by the reeds in the foreground and the symbol in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with fair skin, long dark or dark brown hair, and dark eyes is positioned along the centerline of the frame, shifting from the bottom center toward the center due to camera movement. She is flanked by tall, dark green reeds that extend from the foreground to the midground. As the camera moves downward, it reveals that she is in water, with only her head visible above the surface, while the rest of her body remains submerged and out of sight.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, dilapidated room with grimy, textured walls. In the center, a large, black, star-like symbol is crudely painted across a relatively clean surface framed by a light-colored border, extending onto the dirty walls on either side. To the left stands a white, cast-iron radiator. The foreground is filled with tall, dry reeds on either side that extend to the midground, not obscuring the view of a person seated in the middle, positioned directly in front of the painted symbol. The entire scene is cast in a dim, blue-green light, creating a dark and desaturated atmosphere.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a girl whose head initially appears at the bottom center of the frame, taking up only a small portion. As the camera moves down, it reveals that her head is on the surface of the water, with the rest of her body not visible. In the end, her head remains a small center part of the frame, while the rest shows the surrounding environment.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",
