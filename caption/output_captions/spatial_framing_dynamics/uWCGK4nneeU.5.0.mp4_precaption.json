    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated young woman with brown skin, large brown eyes, and a small nose piercing is shown in the cockpit of a yellow helicopter. She wears a dark tank top and has a pair of goggles pushed up onto her forehead over her short, dark hair. Her face is smudged with dirt. The helicopter's windshield is heavily damaged, with several bullet holes and large cracks. The young woman's expression is initially one of wide-eyed concern, but it shifts to a look of focused determination as she looks forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a vast, arid desert during the daytime, with the camera focused on the front of a pale yellow helicopter in flight. The helicopter's weathered metal body is detailed with rivets and shows significant damage, including multiple bullet holes that have created spiderweb cracks in the cockpit's glass windows. Through the damaged windshield, the utilitarian interior is visible, featuring dark seats with green straps. A person with goggles pushed up on their forehead occupies the pilot's seat as the blurred rotor blades spin and the desert terrain passes by in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a young woman positioned in the center-right of the frame, seated in the middle ground within a helicopter cockpit. The helicopter's exterior occupies the foreground, with its damaged windshield creating a visual layer. An empty seat is visible to the left in the middle ground, and the desert landscape is seen in the background, primarily on the right. The camera, positioned at the subject's eye level, then slowly pushes in, transitioning to a close-up that reframes the woman centrally, focusing on her face and shoulders.",
