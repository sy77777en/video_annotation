    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a top-down perspective, a group of young children plays inside a large inflatable structure. They are all barefoot and dressed in matching light blue short-sleeved shirts and dark shorts. The children have different hairstyles; one boy has short, purple-dyed hair, while another has his dark hair styled in braids. They are actively crawling and moving around, with some looking directly up at the camera with wide, smiling expressions. Scattered across the blue inflatable floor and around the children are numerous small, red plastic balls.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's-eye view, several children play inside a large, enclosed inflatable bounce house. The floor of the structure is dark blue and features several parallel, raised, red inflatable tubes running across its width. Small, red plastic balls are scattered across the blue surface and collected in the crevices alongside the red tubes. The surrounding walls of the bounce house are yellow and red.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, full shot, several children are seen from directly above inside an inflatable structure that fills the frame. The camera's perspective is dynamic, constantly rotating and moving, which causes the children's positions to shift within the frame. Initially, the children are scattered across the middle ground, crawling on the blue floor. A child with braided hair then transitions from the middle ground into the foreground, appearing close to the camera at the bottom and left of the frame while looking upward. This child remains the dominant foreground subject, eventually raising their hands, as the other children continue to move around in the middle ground at various positions, including the top, center, and right. Small red balls are consistently scattered across the floor in the middle ground.",
