    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic skyscape scenery shot of a powerful thunderstorm raging in the dead of night. A massive, dark cloud formation is illuminated from within by intermittent, brilliant flashes of purple and white lightning, revealing its voluminous and churning structure against the deep blackness of the sky. Above the storm, tiny, bright stars are scattered across the expanse, while a few faint blue lights glimmer on the distant, dark horizon. The video lacks a main subject, as its focus is on capturing the atmospheric grandeur and immense scale of the natural phenomenon itself. As the sequence progresses, the lightning within the cloud pauses, making the storm blend into the starry night.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse captures a night sky where a large, dark cloud formation in a distant thunderstorm moves across the scene from right to left. Frequent flashes of purplish-white lightning illuminate the cloud from within, revealing its turbulent structure. Above the storm, the otherwise clear, black sky is dotted with small, white stars. Along the dark, flat horizon at the bottom of the view, a few faint blue lights are visible. Over the course of the sequence, the lightning within the cloud pauses, causing the storm to blend into the starry night.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot focused on a natural phenomenon. Initially, a large thunderstorm cloud, illuminated by internal lightning, is positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. In the background, stars are scattered across the top of the frame, while a dark horizon with a few faint blue lights sits at the very bottom. In a time-lapse, the entire storm cloud formation slowly drifts from the right side of the frame toward the left. The sequence concludes as the lightning ceases, causing the cloud to become a dark silhouette that blends into the night sky on the left, leaving only the background stars and the distant lights on the horizon visible. The camera remains static and is positioned at a straight-on angle to the scenery.",
