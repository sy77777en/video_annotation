    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a ground-level perspective, the camera starts at an upside-down angle, capturing a young, light-skinned girl with long brown hair and red-framed glasses. She wears a white, short-sleeved shirt with frilly details. After a brief rolling motion, she settles onto her stomach, holding and looking down at a smartphone. The lenses of her glasses reflect the light from the phone screen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a level, upside-down perspective, the scene is captured within a narrow indoor space, resembling a shaft or tight corridor. A bright, white light source emanates from the central area, overexposing the ceiling and parts of the surrounding walls. The floor is covered with a red carpet. A person wearing glasses and a white top is lying prone in the foreground, illuminated by the light in the center of the background while looking down at a smartphone held in their hands. The entire view has a slight, unsteady motion.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a little girl rolling on the ground once and then lying on her stomach while looking at her phone. The camera shoots from the direction of her head, showing her upper body, while her lower body is obscured by her upper body.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a girl's upper body, initially framed upside-down in the center. The red floor occupies the foreground at the top of the frame, while a bright light source is visible in the center background. The entire frame then performs a 180-degree roll, reorienting the view. After the rotation, the girl is positioned right-side up, lying prone in the foreground and occupying the center and bottom of the frame. Her hands, holding a phone, are in the immediate foreground at the bottom center. The red floor is now in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, with the bright light remaining in the center background. The camera stays at the girl's level, positioned near her head and looking along her body.",
