    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, wavy blonde hair is seen from the back as she walks through a dimly lit interior. She wears a long-sleeved, vertically striped, ribbed top with what appear to be pink straps or suspenders over her shoulders. Her outfit is completed with shiny, metallic-looking shorts, possibly gold or silver, which are secured by a black belt with a prominent buckle and a chain decoration below it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot frames the character from the hip up as they walk through a dimly lit indoor hallway, taking turns and passing several hallways. All the hallways have light-colored walls, and one is illuminated by a warm wall sconce with a framed picture hanging on the left wall. As the person proceeds, they pass open doorways that offer glimpses into other, more brightly lit rooms, including one with a large window overlooking outdoor greenery and a pool. The camera maintains a close following perspective as the individual navigates the residential space.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera tracks a woman, starting with a medium full shot. As it moves, it shifts to a medium shot before transitioning into a medium full shot of her.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium full shot of a woman positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of a dark hallway, with a brightly lit room visible in the distant background through a doorway. The camera follows her from behind, and as she turns a corner, the framing shifts to a medium shot, with the woman moving from the center to the right of the frame before recentering in the next hallway. In this section, a wall sconce and a picture are positioned on the left wall in the middle ground. The shot then transitions back to a medium full shot as she continues forward, passing a kitchen area in the middle ground on the right and another doorway on the left. The camera consistently follows her from behind at her level, maintaining her central position in the frame as she moves deeper into the background.",
