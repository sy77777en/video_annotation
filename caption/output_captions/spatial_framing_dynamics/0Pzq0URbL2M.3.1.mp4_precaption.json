    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high-angle perspective, a dark, curved conference table is shown, scattered with documents. Several stacks of white paper, some typed and others handwritten, lie on the surface alongside a small, closed, dark red book. A modern black desk lamp illuminates the central area of all the scattered papers on the desk, creating a bright spot in the dimly lit scene. On the left side, a person wearing a tan jacket is partially visible, holding a sheet of paper and facing the table. In the top-right, the hands of multiple people are visible, resting on the edge of the table, with an additional hand near the center of the right edge of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit room with dark, wavy floor tiles, a long, curved, dark brown table is covered with documents, including stacks of typed papers, handwritten notes, and a small, reddish-brown book. A small, modern black desk lamp is positioned on the table, providing illumination near the central area of the scattered papers. Another light source, not visible in the frame, illuminates the person in the foreground from above. In the out-of-focus foreground, a person in a tan jacket holds a document. An overlay of white text is located at the bottom-left of the screen, displaying \"[8,10]\".**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a person reading documents in a conference room from a high angle, with several documents on the table. As the camera moves up, the person who was only partially visible in the bottom-left corner of the frame finally becomes fully visible, while the person in the top-right corner still only has their hands visible in the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle shot, framing the upper body of a person in a tan jacket in the bottom-left foreground. A long, curved, dark table occupies the middle ground, stretching across the frame. Positioned centrally on the table are various documents and a small black desk lamp. In the top-right background, the hands of other individuals are visible resting on the table's edge. As the camera slowly moves upward, the person in the foreground becomes more fully visible, revealing they are standing and holding a document. This movement also provides a wider view of the table and the patterned floor, while the hands in the top-right remain partially in the frame. The camera stays positioned above the subjects throughout the shot.",
