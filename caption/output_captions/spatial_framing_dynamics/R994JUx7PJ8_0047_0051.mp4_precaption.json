    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned young man with short dark hair and a beard sits in a patterned armchair, looking toward the camera. He wears a navy blue varsity-style jacket with white details over an orange hoodie and blue jeans. The view initially shows him from the chest up, then expands to a wider shot revealing he is seated. To his right stands a tall, leafy artificial tree in a pot. To his left, a smaller plant with large, variegated green leaves sits in a woven pot on a small wooden table.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in an indoor space against a solid black backdrop. A man is seated in a patterned, upholstered armchair. Slightly to the left of the center of the frame is a tall, potted tree with dense green foliage. Slightly to the right of the center of the frame, a smaller, broad-leafed plant sits in a woven pot on a small, dark wood end table. As the camera tilts down, a patterned rug with red and gold details becomes visible at the bottom of the frame. Initially, a lighting rig with multiple lights and a single microphone hanging down are visible at the top of the frame and are moved out of view from above as the camera tilts down.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera starts with a person visible from the chest up at the bottom center of the frame. It then tilts downward, revealing a full shot of the person, with only the feet out of the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, framing a man from the chest up in the bottom center of the frame. A tall tree is positioned in the middle ground on the left, while a smaller plant on a table is in the middle ground on the right, all against a black background. A lighting rig and a microphone are visible at the top of the frame. The camera then tilts downward, transitioning to a medium-long shot that reveals the man seated from the shins up, now centered in the frame. As the camera tilts, the lighting rig and microphone exit the frame from the top, and a patterned rug enters the frame in the foreground at the bottom. Throughout the shot, the camera remains positioned at the subject's level.",
