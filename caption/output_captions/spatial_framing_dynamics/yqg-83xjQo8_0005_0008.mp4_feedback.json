    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle shot, capturing the lower half of a large stone monument from its base. The foreground is filled with the plaza's pink and brown stone pavers, which extend into the middle ground where the monument's multi-tiered base is centered. In the background, a long, reddish-orange building stretches across the frame behind the monument, with a street and a mountain visible in the background on the right. The camera then tilts upward, smoothly revealing the entire monument and transitioning to a full shot. In the final composition, the complete monument is centered in the frame, with its top positioned in the upper half against a background of the building and a cloudy sky, while the plaza pavers remain in the foreground at the bottom.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a large, dark stone monument located in the center of a wide plaza paved with pink and brown rectangular stones. The monument sits on a multi-tiered, dark gray, stepped base. The main body of the statue is a tall, weathered column with intricate carvings and reliefs. At its base are several large, rectangular protruding structures. The top of the monument is crowned with a stylized, blocky figure. The entire monument is a uniform dark gray color. In the background, a long, two-story, reddish-orange building with white trim around its windows and arched entryways is visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor public plaza on a sunny day, the view tilts upward from a wide expanse of reddish-brown and gray stone pavers to reveal a large, dark stone monument. The monument, featuring intricate carvings, stands on a multi-tiered dark gray platform at the center of the square. In the background, a long, two-story red building with arched entryways defines the far edge of the plaza. To the right, a street is visible, and a green, tree-covered mountain rises in the distance under a blue sky with scattered white clouds.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: It starts by showing the lower half of the statue, then tilts up to reveal a full shot of it.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
