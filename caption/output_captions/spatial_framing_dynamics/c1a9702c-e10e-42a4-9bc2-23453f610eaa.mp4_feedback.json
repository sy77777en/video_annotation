    "pre_caption": "The shot begins as a full shot of a white cue ball, positioned center-left in the foreground, with the camera level to the ball. The tip of a cue stick occupies the bottom right foreground, and a red ball is in the center middle ground, with other balls and silhouetted people in the background. The camera then pulls back and rises as the cue stick exits the bottom right of the frame, and the cue ball moves toward the center. This movement transitions the scene to a wide shot from a higher angle, now level with the people in the background. In this final composition, the pool table fills the bottom half of the frame from foreground to middle ground, with the cue ball in the center foreground and other balls scattered across the middle ground, while the people at the bar occupy the background across the top half.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white, spherical cue ball starts in the middle ground on a blue felt pool table and moves to the foreground by the end of the video. The light-colored wooden tip of a cue stick is visible to its right. After the cue tip strikes the cue ball, it exits the frame from the bottom right. Behind the cue ball is a solid red billiard ball. Other balls are scattered across the table, including a solid blue ball, a solid black ball, a solid orange ball, and an orange-and-white striped ball. In the dimly lit background, several people are visible as indistinct silhouettes, some sitting at a bar and others standing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit bar at night, the scene centers on a blue felt pool table. A cue stick is positioned in front of a white cue ball, with a solid red ball just beyond it. Other pool balls, including solids and stripes in various colors like blue, orange, black, and so on, are scattered across the table's surface. The perspective shifts from a level close-up to a wider view, revealing the surrounding environment where the indistinct silhouettes of people are gathered in the background, some sitting at a bar and others standing.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot begins with a full shot of the white billiard ball. As the camera rises upward, it transitions to a wide shot of the bar\u2019s interior.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera starts at the same height as the white billiard ball. As it rises, it moves above the ball to align with the height of the group of people.",
