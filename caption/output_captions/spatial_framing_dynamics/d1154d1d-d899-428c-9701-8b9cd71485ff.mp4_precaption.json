    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a young girl of East Asian descent standing and facing the camera. She has short, black hair in a bob with straight bangs. She wears a white, short-sleeved collared shirt under a dark plaid jumper with straps over her shoulders. Attached to her back are small, iridescent, rainbow-colored wings. With both hands, she holds a small globe of the Earth. Her mouth is slightly open as she speaks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a brightly lit indoor hallway with a distinct retro aesthetic. A wide, vibrant orange runner extends vertically down the center of the floor and continues horizontally at the end near the camera, bordered on both sides by muted gray-brown carpeting. Symmetrically placed along the walls are orange armchairs and small, dark wooden side tables. In the background, a doorway with glass panels is visible. A young child wearing small, iridescent, rainbow-colored wings stands in the middle of the orange runner, holding a globe of the Earth. The perspective is from over a solid yellow surface that initially appears at the bottom shortly after the video begins and later occupies the bottom of the view, while the child's mouth moves slightly as she speaks.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with half of a little girl\u2019s head at the bottom edge of the frame, then the camera tilts down, turning into a medium-full shot of her.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static medium shot where a young girl is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. A solid yellow surface occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The girl stands on a central orange runner that extends from the middle ground into the background, where a doorway is centered behind her. Symmetrically placed in the background, on the left and right sides of the frame, are armchairs and side tables. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down at the girl, and the spatial composition remains fixed throughout the clip.",
