    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, positioning a woman in the foreground on the left side of the frame. In the middle ground, a human tower is located in the center-right, surrounded by a crowd, with tall buildings forming the background. Initially, the camera is at the woman's level. As she turns her head to the right, the camera pans slightly right and then tilts sharply upward, following the vertical line of the human tower. This transition reframes the scene into a low-angle shot from below the tower, which now occupies the center of the frame from bottom to top. The crowd is visible at the bottom of the frame, with the woman partially seen in the bottom-left foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a lively street procession where many participants are dressed in blue shirts, white pants, and thick black belts, each adorned with two thin bright pink belts. At the center of the scene, a human tower is formed by three individuals stacked vertically. The base is an adult man with short hair, while the middle is another adult man wearing a bright pink headscarf; both are wearing only the thick black belts. At the top is a child wearing a helmet, with two thin bright pink belts attached to the thick black belt. In the foreground, a young woman with light skin and blonde hair tied in a bun, dressed in a sleeveless top and carrying a backpack, turns her head and smiles, drawing attention to the impressive human tower. The camera follows her gaze to focus on the backs of the three stacked individuals, highlighting their height and the coordinated effort of the group.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene unfolds on a narrow city street during the day, flanked by tall, beige-colored apartment buildings with iron-railed balconies. A human tower is being constructed by a group of performers wearing blue shirts and white pants, watched by a crowd of spectators. The camera, positioned within the crowd, tilts upward, following the performers as they climb on each other's shoulders to form multiple levels, culminating with a small child at the very top. A red and white circular traffic sign is visible on a pole at the street corner. The scene is illuminated by bright, natural daylight.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a crowd moving forward around three people stacked on top of each other. The girl in the foreground turns and smiles. The camera follows her gaze to the right, capturing the backs of the three people stacked high.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to below the subject.",
