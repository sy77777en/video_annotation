    "pre_caption": "A wide shot captures two men positioned symmetrically in the middle ground, with one on the left and the other on the right side of the frame. They are initially shown mid-kick, their bodies extended horizontally. The background features large, hexagonal blue neon light structures, while a complex web of thin light beams fills the space from the background to the foreground. After landing, the men perform a series of dance steps, moving slightly but maintaining their respective positions on the left and right sides of the middle ground. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two light-skinned men, who appear to be bald, are shown performing mostly synchronized movements. They are dressed in identical, tight-fitting, full-body suits with red sections on the torso, arms, and legs, interspersed with black panels. Throughout the video, they execute a series of mirrored martial arts-style kicks, jumping and turning in the air before landing. After landing, they perform a series of identical dance steps, though these are not synchronized.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a large, futuristic room with a hexagonal structure. The concrete-like walls are arranged in evenly spaced lines of bright blue neon light tubes, forming hexagonal patterns with the floor. These tubes also frame a smaller hexagonal dark shape in the background, likely containing a doorway. The floor and walls occasionally dim when the blue neon lights turn off, and the furthest line of tubes sometimes turns red. A complex web of thin light beams crisscrosses the entire space, emanating from various points on the walls and continuously shifting between white and red. Two figures in red and black suits are positioned symmetrically on either side of the room, engaged in mostly synchronized movements.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
