    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a view of a dark, jagged, crystalline structure with multiple spires, which has subtle purple and blue highlights. The structure is perfectly reflected in a still, dark surface beneath it, creating a symmetrical image against a black void. The perspective then shifts to a low-angle, close-up view of two similar dark metal components, one clear and the other blurred. As the video progresses, additional metal components appear and connect the original two into a single structure, all set against a completely black backdrop.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a pitch-black, undefined space, a jagged structure shimmers with dynamic hues of blue and purple, reflected perfectly on a still, dark surface below. Suddenly, two distinct dark components, resembling armor shards, emerge abruptly, adding a sense of surprise. Following this, several chain-like components become visible, connecting the two main components and enhancing the visual complexity. The scene remains enveloped in near-total darkness, with only the shimmering structure, its reflection, and the newly emerged components being visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a jagged, crystalline structure positioned in the center-left of the frame, with its perfect reflection appearing directly below it on a dark surface in the foreground. The camera is positioned at eye level with this reflective surface. The scene then cuts to a low-angle full shot of two dark metal components against a black background. One component is in focus in the foreground at the bottom right, while the other is out of focus in the background at the top left. The camera remains static as additional chain-like elements emerge from the background and connect the two components.",
