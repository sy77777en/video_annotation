    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a cityscape scene featuring a large, ornate fountain within an urban park setting. The view tilts upward from wet, grassy cobblestones to reveal a wide, circular stone basin from which powerful jets of water spray high into the air. The resulting mist primarily obscures the fountain's central sculpture, with only the areas directly behind the mist being partially hidden. In the background, lush green trees, a multi-story brick apartment building, and a white bus on a nearby street are visible. The video aims to establish the atmosphere of the location, focusing on the interplay between the natural-feeling park element of the fountain and the surrounding urban environment, creating a sense of place rather than highlighting a specific entity. The camera's movement emphasizes the scale of the scene and the integration of its various components.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins with a view of a cobblestone path where green grass grows between the stones, tilting up to reveal a large, circular stone fountain in a city park. Multiple jets of water spray high into the air, creating a mist that partially obscures a dark central sculpture. The stone pavement surrounding the fountain is wet. In the background, sunlight illuminates green trees, a multi-story brown-brick building, streetlights, and a white bus on a nearby road.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide scenery shot begins with a low-angle view, showing wet, grassy cobblestones in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The base of a large, circular stone fountain is positioned centrally in the middle ground. The camera then tilts upward, causing the fountain's base to shift to the bottom of the frame. This movement brings the entire fountain, with its central sculpture and high-spraying water jets, into the center of the middle ground. The upward tilt also reveals the background, which includes a multi-story brick building in the top left, green trees framing the scene, and a white bus and streetlights on the right. The camera maintains a low height relative to the fountain throughout the shot.",
