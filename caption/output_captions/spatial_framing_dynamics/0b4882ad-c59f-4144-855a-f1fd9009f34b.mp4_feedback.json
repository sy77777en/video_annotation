    "pre_caption": "In a wide, high-angle shot from a bird's-eye perspective, two dancers are positioned slightly to the left of the center of the frame. They occupy the middle ground on a vast, dark, textured floor that fills the entire scene. The dancers remain in this fixed position within the frame throughout the clip. One dancer lifts the other, who extends their legs, and they perform a slow, contained rotation on the spot without traversing the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a bird's-eye view, two individuals perform a contemporary dance. One person has dark hair and wears a light gray, long-sleeved top with dark, loose-fitting trousers. The other person, also with dark hair, is dressed in a dark top and dark trousers. Both dancers are barefoot. The person in the dark top lifts the person in the light gray top, who raises both legs simultaneously, one in front and one behind, before slowly bringing them down together.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a bird's eye view, two figures are seen slightly to the left of the center of a vast, empty space with a dark gray, textured floor. The scene is dimly illuminated by cool, bluish light. The two individuals, dressed in dark and light contrasting clothing, are engaged in a fluid, continuous dance-like movement across the expansive floor.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
