    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of an indoor scenery. The composition is centered on a closed door positioned in the background at the end of a narrow hallway. Directly above the door, in the top center of the background, is a glowing red light fixture with a sign below it. A multi-paned window is located on the left wall in the middle ground. The walls of the hallway frame the shot on the left and right, extending from the foreground to the background and creating a sense of depth. The camera remains stationary at eye level, providing a straight-on view down the corridor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an interior scenery shot of a dimly lit, narrow hallway leading to a single closed door. The center of the scene is dominated by an intense red glow emanating from a light fixture mounted above the door, casting a sinister hue on the tiled walls and floor. A sign just over the door displays the number \"13\" alongside what appears to be Chinese characters. This stark red light contrasts sharply with the cool, bluish light filtering in from a multi-paned window on the left wall, enhancing the suspenseful and ominous atmosphere. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to establish a mood and a sense of place, focusing on the eerie environment itself rather than a specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An indoor scene shows a narrow, dimly lit hallway with light-colored tiled walls. At the far end, a single closed door with a narrow, vertical window stands under a glowing red bar light that casts a strong red hue on the immediate area. Directly above the door is a small sign that reads \"13 \u53f7\u623f\u95f4\" (Room No. 13). To the left, a multi-paned window is set into the wall. The midground on the left wall and the foreground and midground of the right wall are cast in a contrasting cool light. An overlay of white subtitles is visible at the bottom of the screen, displaying \"[17]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
