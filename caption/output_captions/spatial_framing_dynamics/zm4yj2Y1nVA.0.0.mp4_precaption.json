    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit room, a dark wooden chair with a spindle back is partially illuminated. The surrounding walls are completely covered with numerous rectangular, aged-looking papers. A dark, simple cross hangs on the wall to the left of the chair. The perspective then rotates clockwise and tilts, shifting the focus from the chair to the cross. As the rotation continues, the cross appears to invert, concluding with a view of it upside-down against the paper-covered wall.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, confined room, a wooden chair with a spindled back sits against a wall covered in numerous overlapping rectangular papers. A small, dark cross hangs on the paper-covered wall. The scene is dimly lit by a faint, cool light. The camera initially moves forward while tilting slightly upward, then continues advancing while rotating clockwise. It finally adjusts to a level angle to frame the cross, as the surrounding darkness gradually envelops the scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot begins by showcasing a wide shot of a dimly lit room with papers plastered on the walls. On the floor, there is a chair, and a beam of light shines on it. On the left wall, there is a cross. As the camera moves in, it rotates clockwise, making the cross the focal point, and by the end, it nearly completes a 180-degree rotation, aiming at an upside-down cross.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a high angle, capturing a chair in the middle ground, slightly to the right of center, and a cross on the background wall to the left. The camera then moves forward while rotating clockwise, causing the chair to shift toward the bottom right of the frame and eventually exit the view. This movement repositions the cross from the left side to the center of the frame. The shot concludes after a nearly 180-degree rotation, resulting in a centered, medium shot of the now-inverted cross against the paper-covered background wall, with the surrounding scene fading into darkness.",
