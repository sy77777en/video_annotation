    "pre_caption": "A white, stylized logo is positioned in the center of the frame. Below it, at the bottom of the frame, are several lines of white text. Both the logo and the text are presented as a flat overlay in the foreground against a solid black background that occupies the entire scene. The camera remains static and is positioned straight-on, maintaining a fixed perspective on the elements throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white, stylized logo, composed of an intertwined 'M' and 'O' with a hand-drawn, textured appearance, is centered on a black background. Below the logo, several lines of white, sans-serif text provide information, including \"CLIPS AVAILABLE UP TO 8K RESOLUTION,\" \"COPYRIGHT \u00a9 2017 MIKE OLBINSKI PHOTOGRAPHY,\" \"CONTACT INFORMATION: MikeOlbinski.com,\" and \"MUSIC: PeterNanasi.com.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a static shot with a solid black background. In the center, a white overlay displays a stylized monogram logo, appearing as an intertwined 'M' and 'O' with a hand-drawn, textured look. At the bottom of the screen, additional white text overlays provide information. The top line of this text reads, \"CLIPS AVAILABLE UP TO 8K RESOLUTION // COPYRIGHT \u00a9 2017 MIKE OLBINSKI PHOTOGRAPHY,\" and the line below it states, \"CONTACT INFORMATION: MikeOlbinski.com // MUSIC: PeterNanasi.com.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
