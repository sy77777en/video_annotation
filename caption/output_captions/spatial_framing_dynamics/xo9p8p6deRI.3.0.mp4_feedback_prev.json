    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a bed, framed from a side angle at the subject's level. The footboard is positioned in the right foreground, with the headboard and two nightstands in the middle ground to the left and right. A dresser is visible in the right background. The camera slowly zooms in and moves, shifting its perspective to a high-angle view from above the subject. The shot reframes to a full shot of three papers, now the central subject, arranged in the middle of the frame on the bed. Finally, text materializes on the leftmost paper.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dimly lit, monochromatic bedroom is shown, featuring a large, light gray four-poster bed with a slatted headboard and footboard. The bed is flanked by two nightstands, each holding a lit lamp that provides the only illumination in the dark room. The camera slowly zooms in and pans across the bed, revealing three rectangular, gray pieces of paper lying in a row on the comforter. As the view focuses on the papers, the word \"CHILDREN\" materializes in glowing white, sans-serif letters on the leftmost piece of paper.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit, monochromatic bedroom, a large wooden bed with a slatted headboard and footboard is the central focus. On either side of the bed, matching nightstands hold lit lamps that cast a soft, cool light. In the background, a dresser is partially visible. The camera slowly moves closer to the bed, where three rectangular pieces of paper are arranged in a row on the gray comforter. A glowing white text overlay of the word \"CHILDREN\" appears on the leftmost piece of paper.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and above the subject when the second subject is in focus.",
