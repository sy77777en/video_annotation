    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle medium close-up shot of a man lying on his back, occupying the center of the frame. In the middle ground, a white object is positioned in the top left, a green bottle is in the top right, and confetti is scattered on the surface around him. The camera then performs a quick, blurry pan, causing the first subject to be framed out from the bottom. This movement transitions to a wider, high-angle shot of a second person with blonde hair, who briefly occupies the center of the frame as the camera continues its motion over them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a man with dark skin, a beard, and long, dark dreadlocks lying on his back with his arms spread out. He is wearing yellow-tinted sunglasses and a short-sleeved, patterned shirt featuring black, white, and reddish-brown designs. The camera then blurs and shifts to a view of a light-skinned woman with blonde hair. She is wearing a fluffy white garment, and the edge of a table is visible on her shoulder. At the end of the video, another man with dark skin appears, dressed in an orange-red short-sleeved shirt with yellow and black patterns, along with black striped trousers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor environment, likely the aftermath of a party. The lighting is low with a warm, reddish-purple cast, and the entire view is distorted by a heavy chromatic aberration effect, creating red and blue light fringes around objects. A man in a patterned shirt and sunglasses lies on his back on a light-brown textured surface, where small red and blue confetti pieces are scattered. A quick, blurry camera movement shows another person with blonde hair and a white, fluffy garment. A white hat and the body of a green bottle are also visible in the cluttered space. As the camera moves, the first two individuals are framed out from the bottom of the screen, and a third person enters from the upper right corner, eventually occupying most of the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned above the subject when the first subject is in focus, and above the subject when the second subject is in focus.",
