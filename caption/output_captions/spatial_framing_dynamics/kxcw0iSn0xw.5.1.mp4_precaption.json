    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A red apple with yellow-green mottling falls toward a thin, high-pressure jet of water, momentarily held in the air before being pushed away and splitting into two pieces. The water emanates from the red nozzle of a dark blue hose, which is pointed upwards from the bottom of the frame and features a brass-colored fitting. A fine mist of water sprays out from behind the apple where the jet exits. In the upper left, a person's hand with a light skin tone, wearing an orange wristband, is briefly visible, likely responsible for dropping the apple.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a close-up outdoor shot, a red apple moves downward toward a single, powerful jet of water from an upward-angled blue hose with a brass and red nozzle. The background consists of blurry green foliage under a pale blue sky. A fine mist of water sprays from behind the apple where the jet exits, momentarily holding the shiny, red-and-yellow apple in the air before it is pushed away and eventually splits into two pieces.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of an apple and a hand visible in the upper left, suggesting it has just released the apple. The hand exits the frame, and the apple is cut by a high-pressure water jet before moving toward the upper right, nearly out of frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of an apple in the center of the frame, with a hand briefly visible in the upper-left foreground. A hose extends from the bottom-center foreground, angled upwards toward the center. As the hand exits the upper-left of the frame, the apple descends toward the hose's nozzle. A jet of water shoots up from the nozzle, suspending the apple in the center of the frame while a mist expands into the middle ground behind it. The apple is then propelled upwards and towards the upper right, splitting and moving almost out of the frame. The hose remains stationary in the bottom-center foreground, while the background consists of blurry green foliage below a pale blue sky.",
