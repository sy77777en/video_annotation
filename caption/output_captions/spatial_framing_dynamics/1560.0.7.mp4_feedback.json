    "pre_caption": "This video is presented as a static extreme wide shot of the scenery. In the foreground, the harbor water fills the bottom portion of the frame. The middle ground is occupied by Liberty Island, which is positioned centrally and extends from the bottom left to the bottom right. The Statue of Liberty stands in the vertical and horizontal center of the frame on the island.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a wide waterscape scenery shot featuring the Statue of Liberty from a distance. The iconic, verdigris-green monument stands tall on its stone pedestal on Liberty Island, which is populated with bare winter trees and a few low-lying buildings. The water of the harbor, extending from the foreground to the background, ripples gently, while a hazy cityscape with various buildings is visible in the distant background under a pale blue sky with wispy clouds. The composition is framed to capture the entire environment, emphasizing the sense of place and scale rather than isolating a single main subject. The focus is on the overall atmosphere and the relationship between the landmark, the water, and the distant city.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone presents a wide, daytime view of the Statue of Liberty from across the water of New York Harbor. The verdigris-green statue stands atop its multi-tiered stone pedestal on Liberty Island, which is surrounded by a walkway and dotted with bare trees. The rippling water extends from the foreground to the background, while a city skyline is visible in the distance under a pale, hazy sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
