    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals three people standing together, their forms blurred by motion. The sequence begins with their reflections on a polished surface before tilting up to their bodies. On the left stands a light-skinned woman who appears to be Asian, wearing a dark, sleeveless gown. In the center is a person with a lighter complexion dressed in a light-colored, mid-length sleeve shirt and matching trousers. To the right, another person with a lighter complexion wears a white collared shirt, a dark vest, and dark trousers. The woman on the left and the person in the center are holding champagne flutes, while the person on the right is holding a tray with a glass of champagne on it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins with the reflections of three individuals on a smooth surface, set in a dimly lit, modern room. Ceiling light strips are mirrored in the floor-to-ceiling glass in the background. In the midground, a warm-toned floor lamp stands on each side of the individuals, with a light-colored bed positioned behind them. The three people in the foreground are distinctly visible, dressed in dark and light-colored clothing. As the camera tilts upward, the entire frame exhibits a striped, blurred motion effect. Finally, the video stabilizes at a normal angle, and the bed gradually moves out of the frame from the bottom, leaving a warm, ambient glow from the artificial lighting.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera first captures the reflection of three people on the floor in a full shot, then tilts up to reveal their bodies, presenting a medium-full shot of them at the end.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera first captures the reflection of three people on the floor from above, then tilts up to reveal their bodies as it is at the same height as them.",
    "pre_caption": "The shot begins as a full shot from a high angle, capturing the blurred reflections of three people in the foreground on a polished surface. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning to a medium-full shot at the subjects' height. As the camera moves, the reflections exit the bottom of the frame, and the three subjects enter, positioning one person on the left, one in the center, and one on the right, all in the foreground. A bed is briefly visible in the middle ground at the bottom of the frame before it moves out of view. The room's interior and ceiling lights occupy the background. A strong vertical motion blur is present throughout the entire shot.",
