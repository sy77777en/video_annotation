    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, straight blonde hair and light skin stands in profile within a body of water that rises to her mid-thighs. She is dressed in a black triangle bikini top and loose black shorts. Her body is oriented toward the left, and her head is tilted slightly upward, while her reflection mirrors her stance in the water below.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A sunlit outdoor scene depicts a serene mountain valley where a calm body of water fills the foreground and extends into the background, reflecting the surrounding landscape. Steep, rugged mountains rise on either side to form a deep V-shape, with their lower slopes covered in dense green vegetation that transitions into jagged, gray rock faces adorned with trees and other vegetation at higher elevations. The water is still and clear, mirroring the cliffs and the sky above. In the center of the frame, a woman with long blonde hair stands with water reaching mid-thigh, facing toward the left with her head tilted upward to catch the sunlight, then slowly leaning backward amidst the vast natural setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a woman standing in a lake, positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of the scene. The water fills the bottom of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background, while steep mountains rise on the left and right sides of the background. A reflection of the subject appears in the bottom center of the foreground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, maintaining a static view as the woman, facing left, tilts her head upward and leans her upper body slightly backward.",
