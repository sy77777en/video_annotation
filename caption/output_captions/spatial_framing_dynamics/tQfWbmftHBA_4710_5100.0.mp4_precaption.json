    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective, the tanned legs of a person are visible, extended forward. This person is wearing black, form-fitting water shoes on their feet. Further down the translucent, rectangular water slide tunnel, multiple people can be seen in the distance, all in seated positions and moving away. The specific details of the distant people are obscured by the water and distance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a rapid descent through a water slide during the daytime. The slide is a transparent, rectangular tunnel with dark blue sides and a clear top that reveals strong light from above. White, foamy water rushes along the floor of the slide. Through the transparent walls, a large body of blue water containing dark, rock-like structures is visible on either side. Further down the tunnel, another person is seen moving along the slide. The viewer's legs and feet, wearing black water shoes, are visible in the foreground. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"Attractions 360\u00b0\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the viewer's legs and feet occupy the foreground at the bottom center of the frame. The scene is framed by a translucent, rectangular water slide tunnel, with its sides on the left and right and its top across the upper portion of the frame, creating a strong vanishing point in the center. Rushing white water flows from the foreground towards the middle ground. In the middle ground, centered within the tunnel, other people are visible moving away from the camera. Through the transparent walls on the left and right, a large body of blue water with dark structures is visible in the middle ground. A text overlay is fixed in the bottom right foreground. The entire perspective moves rapidly forward through the tunnel. At the start, a hand briefly moves into the frame from the top, partially obscuring the view. The camera is positioned low, looking forward along the length of the slide.",
