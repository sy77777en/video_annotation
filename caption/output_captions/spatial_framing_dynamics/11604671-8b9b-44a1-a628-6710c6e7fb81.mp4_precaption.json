    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a bird's-eye perspective, four people are clustered together in the center, looking up. One is a light-skinned woman with long, curly, reddish-brown hair, wearing sunglasses, a black jacket vest over a red long-sleeved top. To her left is a person with a darker skin tone and short, dark, curly hair, wearing a shiny red jacket over a black top. Behind the light-skinned woman with long, reddish-brown curly hair, another light-skinned person with curly, reddish-brown hair wears a shiny red jacket. The fourth individual is light-skinned with short, dark hair and is dressed in a black jacket over a red top. Surrounding this group are four large, rectangular signs with white text. A red sign at the bottom reads \"GRAND OPENING,\" a purple sign on the right says \"WELCOME,\" a green sign at the top reads \"SHOP LOCAL,\" and a yellow-orange sign on the left says \"WE'RE OPEN.\" As the camera moves counterclockwise, the elongated yellow and green signs appear sequentially and form a group with the other two signs. When the camera moves clockwise, the signs gradually shift from their original positions.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a top-down perspective, the scene is set indoors on a light gray, textured floor. In the center, four people are grouped together, looking up. Initially, a red banner stating \"GRAND OPENING\" is positioned at the bottom of the frame, and a purple banner with \"WELCOME\" is on the right side. As the video progresses, several large, colorful banners rotate into view, including a yellow one reading \"WE'RE OPEN\" and a green one with \"SHOP LOCAL.\" The scene is brightly lit from above.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a wide, top-down shot, four people are clustered in the center of the frame on the middle ground floor. Initially, they are framed by several large, colorful signs in the foreground: a partial red sign at the bottom, a purple \"WELCOME\" sign in the bottom right, and a partial orange sign in the top left. As the camera rotates counter-clockwise, the orange sign fully enters the frame from the top left, revealing the text \"WE'RE OPEN,\" and a new green \"SHOP LOCAL\" sign appears at the top. The shot then briefly reverses its rotation, settling into a final composition where the four signs\u2014a red \"GRAND OPENING\" sign at the bottom, the purple sign on the right, the green sign at the top, and the orange sign on the left\u2014form a complete rectangular frame around the people in the center.",
