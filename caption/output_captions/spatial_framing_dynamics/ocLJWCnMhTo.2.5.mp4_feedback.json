    "pre_caption": "The scene begins with a low-angle medium shot, focusing on a child's feet in the center foreground, held up towards the ceiling in the background. A person's arm in a red sleeve is visible in the bottom right foreground, helping to hold the child. The child is then lowered, transitioning the composition. The final framing shows a person in a white shirt in the left foreground with their back to the camera, while the person in the red shirt is on the right. They are holding the child between them in the center middle ground. The camera remains positioned below the subjects, maintaining a consistent low-angle perspective throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a red long-sleeved shirt over a white bottom is holding a small child upright. The child is wearing a green and yellow shirt with white shorts and light-colored shoes with textured soles. The child has dark hair. A third individual with short-to-medium blonde hair, wearing a white shirt, is also holding the child. The figures remain static throughout the video. The first person is initially seen from the front and below, and later from the back and top as the camera cranes up.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a worm's-eye view in a moderately lit room with a distinct greenish tint. The floor features black and white checkered tiles, and a thin, dark vertical pole is positioned in the center of the frame, likely as part of a digital effect. The walls are grey and white with dark windows. Two adults, one in a red shirt and the other in a white shirt, are seen lifting a child wearing white shorts toward the ceiling. Both adults consistently support the child, maintaining their position without any significant movement or change in action. The video quality is grainy, resembling old film, and is framed by a dark vignette.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
