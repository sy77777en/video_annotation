    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, two men are positioned opposite each other at a diner table, with one on the left and the other on the right side of the frame. They are situated in the middle ground, with the table between them in the center foreground. In the background, a window provides a view of a city street, where a building with a \"HERO SANDWICHES\" sign is visible in the center. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two light-skinned men are seated opposite each other at a table in a booth. The man on the left is middle-aged with short, yellowish-brown hair and wears a dark suit jacket over a light-colored collared shirt. He leans forward with his arms crossed on the table, looking at the other man. The man on the right appears younger, with dark brown, styled hair and is dressed in a light blue suit jacket over a dark collared shirt. He sits upright with his head leaning slightly forward and occasionally gestures with his right hand near his chin as he speaks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This daytime scene is set inside a diner, viewed from a booth where two men are seated across from each other at a white-topped table. The table holds plates of food, a glass of orange juice, a coffee pot, and a ketchup bottle. Brown curtains frame the window, which offers a view of a city street with parked cars, including a light-colored sedan. Across the street, a building features a sign for \"HERO SANDWICHES.\" The environment outside appears active with light traffic and pedestrians.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
