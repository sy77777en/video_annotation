    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black-and-white scene, two men are standing on what appears to be a balcony or overpass. The man on the left is a white man with a short buzz cut, wearing a dark zippered bomber jacket over a light-colored collared shirt and dark pants, with his hands in his pockets. Positioned on the right side of the frame, a man with a light skin tone and dark hair leans against the railing. He wears a dark beanie, a dark jacket with a fur-lined collar over a light-colored tracksuit top, and light-colored pants. A third man, who is Black, enters from the right side of the scene. He is wearing a dark beanie, a heavy, dark shearling-style jacket, and camouflage-patterned pants. He walks past the other two men.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This black-and-white scene is set outdoors on a high vantage point, such as a rooftop or overpass, overlooking a long, straight street in a city with classic European architecture. Multi-story buildings with uniform windows line the busy thoroughfare below, where the headlights of moving traffic are visible. In the distance, the silhouette of a steeple rises against an overcast sky. Two young men in jackets stand by a railing, while a third person enters the frame from the right, walks past the two men from right to left, and then exits the frame on the left.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, two men are positioned in the foreground, one on the left and the other on the right, standing on a high vantage point. Behind them, a long city street lined with buildings extends from the middle ground into the deep background, creating a central vanishing point. A third man enters the frame from the right, walks left across the foreground, passing between the other two men, and then exits on the left. Throughout the scene, the camera, positioned at the subjects' level, slowly pushes in, causing the framing on the two stationary men to become slightly tighter.",
