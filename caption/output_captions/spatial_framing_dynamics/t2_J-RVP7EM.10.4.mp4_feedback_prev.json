    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, high-angle shot of an abstract, animated scene. Initially, two tall figures stand in silhouette in the foreground on the center-right, positioned on a cloud-like platform that occupies the bottom of the frame. In the background, a luminous, canyon-like area is centered, containing a multitude of smaller figures that recede into the distance. The scene is framed by dark, cavernous shapes on the top, left, and right. As the shot progresses, the camera slowly moves to the right, causing the two foreground figures to shift from their center-right position toward the right edge of the frame, while the central chasm in the background shifts toward the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In this black and white, abstract animation styled like an engraving, two tall, slender figures stand in the foreground on the center-right. They are depicted as black-and-white silhouettes wearing long, flowing robes and are positioned on a formation resembling clouds with a horizontal stripe texture. These two figures are facing away from the viewer, looking towards a brightly glowing, canyon-like chasm in the background. Within this luminous chasm, a large multitude of smaller, indistinct, glowing white figures, also seemingly robed, are visible, appearing to be on a long pathway that recedes into the bright distance, raising their arms. As the camera moves, the two tall, slender figures shift to the right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a monochromatic, engraving-style animation, a dark, cavernous space is filled with stylized, billowing clouds. A brilliant light emanates from a central opening, illuminating a multitude of indistinct, glowing figures who remain stationary with their arms raised. The formation resembles a large chasm rather than a winged entity. In the foreground, two robed figures stand in silhouette on a cloud platform, observing the chasm-like vision. The clouds and surrounding darkness feature a linear, etched texture, giving the scene a classical, illustrative appearance.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This is a relatively abstract animation. There are two standing figures standing on the clouds in the foreground, and a group of people in a canyon-like area in the background.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
