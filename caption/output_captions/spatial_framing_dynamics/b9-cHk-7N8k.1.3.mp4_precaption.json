    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a man with a medium-to-dark tan complexion, dark hair, a beard, and a mustache, smiling while looking at the camera. He is wearing a black and blue life vest with the word \"HYPERLITE\" on it and a black baseball cap with a yellow and white logo. He is positioned in the foreground on a speedboat, holding a camera. In the mid-ground, a woman with a medium-to-dark tan complexion is standing inside the boat's cabin, facing to the right, wearing a light-colored bikini that appears off-white or light blue. At the stern of the boat, under the canopy, two women are seated. The woman on the left is wearing a black bikini and is in a relaxed pose with one hand raised to her head. The woman on the right is also in a dark bikini and is wearing a black and blue life vest, seated at the stern, facing forward. Additionally, a shirtless man wearing blue-gray shorts is seated at the back right of the boat, facing towards the inside with his head turned to the side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a selfie point of view, a man wearing a black and blue life vest and a black cap is seen on a speedboat. The boat is on a calm, dark blue body of water, surrounded by massive, layered red and orange rock canyons under a clear, sunny sky. The still water reflects the surrounding landscape. In the middle ground, a woman is standing in the boat cabin, while two women in swimsuits are seated near the stern under a black canopy, and another man is also seated nearby.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a man occupies the foreground, positioned in the left and center of the frame. In the middle ground, a woman stands to the right of center inside a boat, while another woman is seated further back in the top right under a canopy. The boat itself extends from the foreground into the middle ground on the right side of the scene. The surrounding water is visible in the middle ground, with large rock canyons filling the background across the top and left portions of the frame. The camera is positioned at the main subject's level.",
