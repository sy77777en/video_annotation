    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a scene from a 2D pixel-art video game, viewed from a top-down perspective. The main subject is a small player character with black hair, a red shirt, and blue pants. The character is shown placing a wooden bridge tile to connect a small ledge to a large, well-lit wooden platform built over dark water. This platform serves as a base and is filled with various pixelated objects, including a row of green storage chests, a larger silver and blue chest, a blue bed, and several crafting stations that resemble a furnace, an anvil, and workbenches. The game's user interface is also visible, showing red, orange, and blue status bars in the top-left, a mini-map in the top-right, an inventory hotbar at the bottom, and controller button prompts in the bottom-right.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video featuring a top-down 2D view, where the camera is positioned above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides. The scene is set in a dark, torch-lit cavern next to a body of dark water. A large, square wooden platform is built over the water, connected to the reddish-brown, grassy land by a small wooden bridge. The platform, constructed from light brown wooden planks with a repeating square pattern, is furnished with various items, including a blue bed, several chests of different colors, and multiple crafting stations. A small character with dark hair walks from the platform onto the bridge. Overlays on the screen include health and status bars in the top-left corner, a minimap in the top-right, an item hotbar at the bottom, and controller button prompts in the bottom-right.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot is captured from a top-down perspective, showing a large environment. Initially, a player character stands in the middle ground on a small land ledge, positioned on the left side of the frame. A large wooden platform, also in the middle ground, occupies the center and right of the frame, situated over water that separates it from the land on the left. In the foreground, UI elements are fixed in place: status bars are in the top-left, a mini-map is in the top-right, an inventory hotbar is at the bottom, and controller prompts are in the bottom-right. A wooden bridge tile is placed, connecting the ledge to the platform. The character then walks from the left ledge, across the new bridge, and onto the main platform, moving from the left-center towards the center of the frame.",
