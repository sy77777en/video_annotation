    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot, capturing expansive views of a barren, sandy shoreline meeting a calm, blue body of water under a pale sky, and transitioning to a wide, arid plain dotted with sparse, weathered structures and distant mountains beneath a clear blue sky. There is no main subject because the focus is on the vastness and emptiness of the environment, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the natural and semi-abandoned landscape rather than any specific object or individual. The visual narrative centers on the mood and character of the setting itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an outdoor setting that transitions from a wide, sandy shoreline with calm blue water stretching to the horizon under an overcast sky, to a dry, barren landscape with light brown earth, scattered debris, and distant low mountains beneath a clear blue sky. In the first environment, the sand appears pale and smooth, with a few weathered wooden posts or branches protruding from the foreground, while the water remains still and the horizon is faintly visible. The second environment features rough, uneven ground with small mounds, sparse utility poles, and a few simple structures in the distance, all set against the backdrop of mountains with some snow visible on their peaks. There are no overlays, text, or digital elements present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture the landscape scenery, with no main subject present. In the first scene, the sandy shoreline occupies the lower half of the frame (foreground and middle ground), with a few weathered wooden posts or branches positioned along the bottom edge (foreground, bottom), while the calm blue water stretches across the middle and upper portions (middle ground and background, center and top), and the pale sky fills the top (background, top). The horizon line is visible near the upper third of the frame. In the second scene, the camera continues with a wide shot, showing a dry, barren plain that fills most of the frame (foreground and middle ground), with scattered debris and utility poles distributed from the left to the right (foreground and middle ground, left, center, and right), and a few small structures and distant mountains along the upper edge (background, top). The camera appears to be positioned at a height close to ground level, slightly above the surface, providing a level perspective across both scenes. The transition between scenes is a cut, shifting from the shoreline to the arid plain, with each environment maintaining a broad, expansive spatial framing.",
