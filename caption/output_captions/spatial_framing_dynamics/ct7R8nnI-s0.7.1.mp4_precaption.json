    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a shallow depth of field effect, focusing on a person wearing a tan, loose-fitting coat with a matching hood, riding a brown horse. Initially, only a portion of the person's body is visible. As an object swiftly moves through the foreground, the subject, who is moving away from the camera, gradually recedes into the distance, causing the frame to progressively lose focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a vast, open outdoor environment under a pale, uniform sky. The entire shot is characterized by rapid, shaky motion, causing the details to be heavily blurred. A figure wearing a tan garment is visible against the bright background, initially positioned in the foreground while riding a horse. As an object quickly passes through the foreground, the figure moves to the midground. After the object exits the frame from the left side, the figure returns to the foreground. The color palette is muted, consisting primarily of browns, tans, and the pale grey of the sky.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject\u2019s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an extremely shaky and blurred close-up shot, where a tan-colored object is in the left foreground and a dark, moving shape is in the center-right foreground, all against a pale sky in the background. The framing rapidly transitions to a full shot as the subject, a person on a horse, moves away from the camera. In the final framing, the subject is positioned in the center of the frame and has receded into the middle ground. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
