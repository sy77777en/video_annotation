    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a young man positioned in the center of the frame, with the camera at his level. Large, out-of-focus blood splatters occupy the foreground, partially obscuring the man in the middle ground. A dark object with a wooden texture extends from the bottom right foreground toward the center. The shot then transitions to a close-up, tightening the frame to focus on the man's face, which remains in the center, while the foreground blood splatters persist.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This animated video shows a close-up view of a young man with light skin and short, light brown hair. His light-colored eyes are wide in an expression of terror, and his mouth is open with his teeth bared. He wears a light-colored collared shirt under a harness with dark straps. His face is covered in blood, and large, red blood splatters are visible, partially obscuring the view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit and chaotic animated scene, a person with light-colored hair lies on a light-colored ground stained with bright red blood. Their face is covered in dirt, and their eyes are wide open. Blood is splattered throughout the scene, partially obscuring the view and covering the person, who wears a light-colored garment with dark straps. A dark object with a wooden texture appears to be piercing towards the person's chest from the edge of the frame. The scene is predominantly dark, with focused, dramatic lighting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
