    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium-full shot of a man standing in the left-middle ground on a tree-lined street. A large tree trunk occupies the right foreground, while a black metal fence runs along the bottom-left foreground. In the middle ground, a car is parked on the street to the right of the man, with brownstone buildings and additional trees filling the background on both the left and right sides of the frame. The camera then moves forward, pushing in on the subject, which transitions the shot into a close-up that centers on the man's face. Throughout this movement, the camera maintains a position at the subject's eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black man with a goatee stands on a sidewalk, wearing a brown suede-like jacket, dark pants, a brown fedora with a black band, and dark sunglasses. He holds a small, silver object up to his mouth. The video starts with a shot of the man from the knees up, occupying about 30% of the lower part of the frame, and gradually zooms in for a close-up, focusing on his face. In the middle ground, a dark sedan is parked on the street.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a sunny, tree-lined residential street in an urban environment. The paved road is flanked by multi-story brownstone buildings, with a row of classic townhouses visible on the right. A prominent tree trunk stands in the right middle ground, and lush green foliage is abundant. A black metal fence runs along the sidewalk on the left, and a car is parked in the distance. A man wearing a brown hat and sunglasses stands on the sidewalk.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a man in orange clothing, wearing sunglasses and a hat, in an urban street scene. The shot begins with the man\u2019s body from the knees up, occupying only 30% of the frame, leaving more content for the surroundings. The camera then moves closer, gradually increasing his size in the frame, until it focuses on a close-up of him.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
