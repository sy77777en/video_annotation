    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with a muscular build and short dark hair, wearing pink and white patterned swim trunks, runs and jumps from a cliff. A group of people watches him. To the left, a shirtless, light-skinned man in dark patterned swim trunks stands to the right of two light-skinned women with long dark hair; one wears a black two-piece swimsuit and the other a black one-piece. In front of them, a shirtless, light-skinned person is wearing light-colored shorts. On the far right, another shirtless, light-skinned man wearing dark shorts and a dark baseball cap stands and holds a smartphone, filming the diver. After the jump, the light-skinned arms of the person filming become visible, outstretched over the edge of the cliff.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a jump from a high, grassy cliff into a vast, turquoise ocean under a bright blue sky. The scene begins on the cliff's edge, where other people in swimwear are present. The perspective shows a running start before leaping off the rocky, vegetated cliffside. During the descent, another person is visible in the air, having already jumped. The sequence concludes as the camera plunges into the water, showing a turbulent, bubbly underwater view with the bright sun visible through the surface.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a man in the center middle ground, running away from the camera towards the ocean in the background. A group of people is positioned in the middle ground to the left, while another individual stands on a higher surface in the middle ground to the right. The perspective then abruptly shifts to a first-person point-of-view from the cliff edge, looking down from a high angle. A different person, who has already jumped, is seen in the center-left of the frame, falling through the middle ground towards the water below. The arms of the person holding the camera then enter the foreground at the bottom of the frame as they leap off the cliff. As the camera moves forward and down, the first jumper is momentarily visible far below in the center, just before hitting the water. The camera continues its descent, with the cliff face on the left, before plunging into the water. The scene concludes with an underwater shot from below the surface, looking up towards the sun at the top of the frame as bubbles rise through the water.",
