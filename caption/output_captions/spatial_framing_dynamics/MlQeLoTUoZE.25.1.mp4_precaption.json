    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A fair-skinned man with short, dark brown hair is shown wearing a dark, futuristic military-style uniform. The uniform features an armored shoulder pad on his left shoulder only. On both sides of his shoulder, there are three yellow chevron accents on the suit itself. Above the chevrons on his left shoulder, a yellow, star-like insignia is visible. He is initially seen from the chest up, looking slightly to his left. He then turns and walks away, revealing the back of his uniform, which has a central, spine-like structure with several small, glowing green lights.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit, futuristic indoor corridor with dark, paneled walls, a man in a uniform turns and walks away. The uniform is dark grey with lighter grey armor plating on the chest and shoulders, featuring yellow chevron accents on the shoulder with a yellow insignia positioned above them. As the man walks down the dim hallway, a series of small, glowing green lights are visible running down the back of his uniform.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He then turns away from the camera and walks directly into the background. As he moves away, the shot transitions to a medium shot, with the man remaining in the center of the frame as he proceeds down a corridor. The camera remains static and positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
