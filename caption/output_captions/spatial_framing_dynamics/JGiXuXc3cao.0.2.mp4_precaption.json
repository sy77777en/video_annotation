    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A digital map is displayed on a black background with a subtle, greenish-white marbled texture. A white grid covers the scene, creating a coordinate system. At the center of the grid, a glowing red dot changes shape and size due to perspective shifts. Shortly after the video begins, the words \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL\" fade in, displayed in bold, glowing red, capital letters. White text boxes on the screen indicate coordinates, with \"LONG: 50.14\" at the top and \"LAT: 41.46\" on the right. In the bottom left corner, a white circular icon contains a diamond-shaped compass needle that slightly rotates while primarily pointing upwards.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene displays a digital map with a black, marbled background covered by a white grid. A red dot near the center changes shape and size due to shifts in perspective. Shortly after the video begins, red text fades in to the left of the dot, reading \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL.\" Additional white text overlays indicate coordinates, with \"LONG: 50.14\" at the top and \"LAT: 41.46\" on the right. In the bottom left corner, a white, circular compass icon is present. The entire display is framed by a white, segmented border.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle perspective, a digital map with a black, marbled background is presented in the middle ground. A white grid is overlaid on this map, with a glowing red dot positioned near the center of the frame. The entire map plane, including the grid and dot, slowly tilts and rotates in 3D space, causing the grid lines to shift their angles and the central dot to distort its circular shape due to the changing perspective. The red text \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL\" fades into view in the center-left, moving in sync with the map's rotation. Static white text boxes displaying coordinates are fixed in the foreground at the top (\"LONG: 50.14\") and right (\"LAT: 41.46\"), while a circular compass icon in the bottom-left foreground contains a needle that rotates slightly. A segmented white border frames the entire scene.",
