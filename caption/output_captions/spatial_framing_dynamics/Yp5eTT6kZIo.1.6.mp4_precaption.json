    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a large crowd of people gathered in a spacious hall, divided into two groups on either side of a central aisle. The people are mostly dressed in dark, indistinct clothing. In the group on the left, a woman with light-colored hair, wearing a white dress and a tan shawl, is visible next to a man. As the camera pulls back, a man in the foreground first comes into view from the right and then comes into focus. He is shown from a side and back angle, wearing a heavy, brown shearling coat with a thick, light-colored plush lining visible on the turned-out portion of his collar and light-colored plush in the portion behind his neck. He has a shaved head and wears a prominent mask that covers the lower half of his face, featuring a mostly dark-colored front piece and a dark and white band that goes across his head. He is sitting or leaning against a column, observing the crowd.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place within a vast hall featuring a high, beamed ceiling and a polished, reddish-brown tiled floor that reflects the surroundings. Bright, direct sunlight streams through a series of tall, arched windows along the left wall, casting long shadows and creating a stark contrast with the darker areas of the room. At the far end of the hall, a large, open archway reveals a subsequent space containing a pile of what appears to be furniture and debris. A single, ornate chair with red upholstery stands isolated in the middle of the floor. Two distinct groups of people are present, with one crowd gathered on the left and another group gathered on the right, forming a clear aisle down the center of the hall.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: At the beginning of the video, there is no focus on any person. There are many people in the picture, which is basically a wide shot. As the lens zooms out, the camera focuses on a man in the foreground, which is considered a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a large hall, where two distinct groups of people are positioned in the middle ground on the left and right sides of the frame, forming a wide aisle down the center. A single chair is located in the center of the frame within this aisle, and a large archway filled with debris is visible in the central background. Tall windows line the top left of the frame, while the polished floor occupies the bottom half. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, then pulls back, revealing a man who enters from the right and settles in the right foreground. This transition reframes the scene into a medium shot, focusing on the man from a side and back angle, while the crowds and the hall are pushed into the middle ground and background to the left.",
