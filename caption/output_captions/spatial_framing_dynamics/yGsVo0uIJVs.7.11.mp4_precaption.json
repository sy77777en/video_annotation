    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A low-polygon, white bust of a man is depicted from the chest up, looking down and to his right with a neutral expression. His form, including his styled, swept-back hair and facial features, is composed of distinct geometric facets, giving him the appearance of a digital sculpture. He is dressed in a white collared shirt and a black skinny tie, both rendered in the same faceted style. To the left, glowing white text in a monospaced font serves as an overlay, reading, \"We expect to finish testing in two to three weeks.\" In the blurred foreground on the left, the top of a vintage-style microphone can be seen.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting with a cool, blue-grey color palette, a white, low-polygon bust of a man with angular features is positioned on the right. The figure is depicted wearing a white collared shirt and a black tie. In the blurry foreground to the left, a microphone-like object is partially visible. An overlay of glowing blue, monospaced text is present on the left side of the scene, displaying the words, \"we expect to finish testing in two to three weeks.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static medium close-up shot, a low-polygon bust of a man is positioned in the right middle ground. In the left foreground, glowing text is overlaid on the scene, and the top of a blurred microphone is visible in the bottom-left foreground. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the clip.",
