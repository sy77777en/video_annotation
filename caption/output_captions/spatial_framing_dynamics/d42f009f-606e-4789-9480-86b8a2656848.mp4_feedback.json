    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, three women are seated on a couch in the middle ground, initially positioned on the left, center, and right of the frame. A laptop rests in the foreground at the bottom center, and a wall of photographs occupies the background. The women on the left and in the center lean forward and move inward, converging over the laptop and shifting closer to the center of the frame, while the woman on the right also leans in from her position. This movement results in all three subjects being clustered tightly together in the middle of the scene, looking down at the laptop. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Three women are sitting close together on a couch, leaning forward to look at a silver laptop. The woman on the left, who appears to be of East Asian descent, has long dark hair styled in a braid and wears a dark long-sleeved shirt while smiling. In the middle, a woman with a light complexion has her brown hair in a high ponytail, secured by a black headband, and is dressed in a black turtleneck. On the right, a woman with a light complexion and blonde hair pulled into a ponytail wears a blue Nike hoodie and smiles. The laptop in front of them has a visible Apple logo on its lid.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a well-lit indoor setting, three women are seated on a dark couch, positioned in front of a wall covered with a grid of numerous small photographs, some of which are black-and-white. The women are gathered closely, looking down at an open silver laptop placed before them. The woman on the right wears a blue hooded sweatshirt, the woman in the center wears a black top and a black headband, and the woman on the left wears a dark top. They are smiling and leaning in towards the laptop screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
