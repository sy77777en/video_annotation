    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of eight individuals, including two men in sleeveless black vests and long pants, and six women in black long-sleeve tops and short skirts, standing in a circle. In the center, a woman with long dark hair stands out in a bright orange long-sleeve top, a short skirt, and black thigh-high boots. She is standing and waving her arms, creating a dynamic contrast with the surrounding group. The individuals in black are positioned evenly around her, occasionally raising their arms outward in a coordinated manner, highlighting the symmetry and visual distinction between the central figure and those encircling her.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a direct top-down, bird's-eye perspective, the scene is set on a dark, patterned floor in an indoor space. The floor's design features a central target-like motif with concentric circles of white, cyan-blue, and purple. Surrounding these are four semicircles that match the color and style of the concentric circles. The overall pattern is a grid created by alternating purple and white straight lines that connect the circles and semicircles, along with thin, straight, light-colored lines. A group of people, with one individual in a bright orange outfit at the center and the rest in black, are positioned in a circle. They engage in synchronized, spinning movements, their bodies and limbs extending outwards in a circular dance formation. The edges of the view are darkened with a vignette effect.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In this wide, top-down shot, a central figure in an orange outfit occupies the middle of the frame, positioned directly over a target-like pattern on the floor. Eight other individuals dressed in black are arranged in a circle around the central figure, occupying the surrounding middle ground. The entire group is framed by a geometric floor design of concentric circles and intersecting lines. As the scene progresses, the central person remains stationary in the center while extending their arms and legs. Simultaneously, the surrounding group begins a synchronized spinning motion, extending their limbs and hair outward from the center while maintaining their circular formation. The camera remains static in its high-angle position throughout the movement.",
