    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of young people celebrates in a room with a black and white checkered floor. In the center, a person with neck-length blonde hair, wearing a blue t-shirt, leans over and embraces a smaller person who is also wearing a blue t-shirt. Both are being showered with white and colored confetti, which is being dispersed by a person in a white t-shirt with a colorful graphic who has their arms raised. Other people surround them, including a person in a red top playing a wind instrument and another individual in a white patterned t-shirt wearing a grey cap. The group is tightly clustered together in a celebratory manner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place indoors, on a black and white checkerboard tile floor. The video begins with a hip-level, worm's-eye view and then cranes upward in an arc, transitioning to a high-angle perspective at eye level. A group of people and objects are seen stationary as a dense shower of white and colored confetti appears suspended around them, creating the illusion of movement through the camera's motion. The ceiling has a greenish hue, while the entire video has a grainy, low-fidelity visual quality with a soft focus. The composition is framed by a solid black border on all sides.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This medium shot begins with a low-angle view, framing a group of people in the center of the frame. A person with blonde hair occupies the foreground, leaning over another individual in the middle ground. Other people are positioned around them in the middle ground, standing on a black and white checkered floor that fills the bottom of the frame. The camera then executes an upward arcing motion, transitioning from its initial low-angle position to a high-angle perspective directly above the subjects. This movement reframes the group from a top-down view, with the central pair remaining in the center of the composition and the checkered floor now serving as the background beneath them. Throughout the entire shot, confetti falls from the top of the frame, occupying the foreground, middle ground, and background space between the camera and the people.",
