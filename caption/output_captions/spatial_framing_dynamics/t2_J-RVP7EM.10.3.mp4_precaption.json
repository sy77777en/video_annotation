    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short, light-blond hair is seen from behind, standing in front of a dark-colored door. He is wearing a white, long-sleeved collared shirt tucked into dark trousers, with his hands placed on the front of his waist. He has a slender build and is positioned on the right side of the frame, facing away from the viewer and towards the entrance of a house.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor scene set at dusk, a person is viewed from behind as they stand before the front door of a house. The house features light-colored horizontal siding and a dark-colored door with a windowed upper panel. A lit porch light on the wall casts a warm glow over the entrance, and a mailbox is mounted below it. The person's hands are subtly moving, adding a slight dynamic element to the scene. The entire video is presented with a vintage film effect, featuring desaturated colors, a warm tint, soft focus, and a black frame overlay with rounded corners.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video is presented as a static medium full shot, with the camera positioned at the subject's level. A man is located in the middle ground, occupying the right side of the frame as he stands before a door. The door is also in the middle ground, positioned in the right-center of the composition. To the left of the door, the house's wall, a porch light, and a mailbox are situated in the middle ground. A blurred structural element is visible in the foreground on the far left, creating a sense of depth.",
