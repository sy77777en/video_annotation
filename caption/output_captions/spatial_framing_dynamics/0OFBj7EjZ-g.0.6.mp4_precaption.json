    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A low-angle, upward-tilted view reveals a massive, freestanding cylindrical aquarium. The transparent tank is filled with deep blue water and is supported by a dark, geometric metal framework. Inside, various small fish swim throughout the water column. Among them are several reddish-pink fish and a few with bright yellow tails. A large, dark rock formation rests at the bottom of the aquarium. The initial view is partially obscured by a large, tan-colored architectural structure at the top of the frame, with the perspective gradually revealing more of the aquarium's significant height.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective looking up, the scene captures a massive, freestanding cylindrical aquarium within a dimly lit indoor space. The aquarium, filled with deep blue water, is encased at its base by a dark, geometric metal framework, and features a dark metallic spiral structure on both sides. A solid, light-brown ceiling or upper level is visible at the top of the frame, partially obscuring the view. Inside the tank, rock formations rest at the bottom, while several small, colorful fish, including red and yellow varieties, swim throughout the water.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a cylindrical aquarium with swimming fish inside. At the start, almost the top half of the frame is occupied by the foreground's architectural structure, while the lower part reveals a small portion of the aquarium, occupying about 60% of the frame's width. As the camera moves forward and tilts upward, it gradually reveals more of the cylindrical aquarium.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle perspective, the shot initially frames a large, cylindrical aquarium in the middle ground, occupying the lower half of the screen. A dark, geometric framework is visible at the bottom of the frame, supporting the tank. The top half of the frame is obscured by a tan architectural structure in the foreground. Inside the aquarium, a rock formation sits at the bottom center, while a few fish swim in the central water column. The camera then slowly pushes in and tilts upward, causing the foreground structure to move out of the top of the frame. This movement progressively reveals more of the aquarium's height, making it the dominant central element. As the view expands upward, more fish become visible, swimming in various directions throughout the middle-ground space of the tank.",
