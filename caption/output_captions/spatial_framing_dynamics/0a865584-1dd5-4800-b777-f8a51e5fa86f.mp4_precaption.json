    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **On a pool table with a red felt surface and a red cushion, several pool balls are present. In the center is a striped ball that is half blue and half white. To its right is a solid white ball. Near the back cushion is a solid purple ball, and to the far left is a striped ball that is half purple and half white. On the right side, another striped ball, half yellow and half white, is visible. A person's light-skinned hand rests on the edge of the table on the right, with the fingers slightly curled.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a pool table with a red felt surface and matching red rails is the central focus. Several pool balls are on the table, including a stationary solid white ball, which appears yellowish due to the lighting conditions, a solid purple ball near the back cushion, and a purple and white striped ball on the far left. A solid white ball spins as it rolls across the center of the table. In the foreground, the fingers of a person's hand are initially in sharp focus on the right edge of the table, becoming blurred as the camera adjusts its focus. The scene is characterized by warm, focused lighting and a grainy, film-like texture, with the background obscured in shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static close-up shot of a red pool table, with the camera positioned at the level of the table's surface. In the center of the frame, a blue and white striped ball spins in place in the middle ground. To its left, a stationary solid white ball is also in the middle ground, while a solid purple ball is positioned further back near the top cushion in the background. A person's hand rests in the bottom-right foreground, and another striped ball is partially visible on the far left in the middle ground. A blurry green object occupies the bottom foreground, partially obscuring the view. The spatial framing remains constant throughout the shot.",
