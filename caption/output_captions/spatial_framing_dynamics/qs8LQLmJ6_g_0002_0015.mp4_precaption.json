    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dynamic aerial cityscape scenery shot. The camera exhibits a distinct movement pattern, simultaneously moving backward and zooming in, enhancing the expansive scale of the location and the serene atmosphere of the moment. A long, straight road with light traffic runs through the center of a densely built town nestled within a valley. The scene is framed by layers of dark, hazy mountains that recede into the distance. A brilliant golden sun is setting directly behind the central mountain range, casting a warm, orange and pink glow across the sky and bathing the entire landscape in the soft light of dusk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of a town situated in a valley at sunset. A long, straight road with light traffic runs through the center of the town, flanked by densely packed, multi-story buildings with varied rooftops. In the background, layers of silhouetted mountains rise against an orange and yellow sky, with the sun visible just above the peaks. A light haze hangs over the town and in the distant valleys, and a small monument is visible on a hilltop to the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This scenery is captured in an extreme wide shot from a high-angle perspective. The town's buildings occupy the bottom and middle ground, centered in the frame and bisected by a straight road that recedes from the bottom center toward the background. Layers of mountains are situated in the background, stretching across the frame, with the sun positioned in the top center, just above the mountain peaks. The camera executes a dolly zoom, moving backward while simultaneously zooming in. This action causes the foreground buildings at the bottom of the frame to expand and move toward the edges, while the background mountains appear to compress and move closer, dynamically altering the sense of depth and perspective.",
