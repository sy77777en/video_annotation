    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pixelated character with dark hair and light skin initially moves around the starting point of the track before sitting in a small, wooden minecart positioned on the track. The surrounding area contains several unusual entities. A red, spiky, circular, pulsating creature moves near the starting point of the track. Also present are round, orange, pulsating blobs scattered across the terrain. The ground itself is covered in large, irregular patches of a red, blood-like substance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A gaming video with a top-down or oblique top-down view, where the camera is placed above the character and environment, looking downward to show mostly the tops of objects with limited sides, moves across a dark, underground cavern. The scene is illuminated by numerous small torches mounted on the earthen walls and scattered on the ground. A straight set of minecart tracks runs horizontally through the middle of the frame, where a character later rides in a minecart. The ground is a mix of brown dirt, patches of green moss, and large, amorphous red substances. Small, spiky red creatures and round orange creatures are positioned across the cavern and near the tracks. Overlays are present on the screen, including a health bar in the top-left, a mini-map in the top-right, an item hotbar in the bottom-center, and controller button prompts in the bottom-right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It is a 2D video, making it hard to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot maintains a high-angle, top-down perspective throughout the video. Initially, a pixelated character stands in the center of the frame on a horizontal minecart track located in the middle ground. To the character's left, a red, spiky creature moves on the same track. The upper middle ground contains large red patches and several orange blobs, while a wooden structure occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The character then enters a minecart and travels from right to left along the track. The camera pans left, tracking the minecart and keeping it centered horizontally. As the camera moves, the initial environment scrolls off-screen to the right, while new sections of the cavern, including a stone archway in the bottom-left foreground, enter the frame from the left. UI elements remain in a fixed position in the corners and at the bottom of the screen.",
