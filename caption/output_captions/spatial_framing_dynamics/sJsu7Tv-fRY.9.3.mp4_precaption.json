    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A Black woman with short, dark hair is being interviewed. She wears a light-colored jacket over a patterned blue and white blouse and has a small earring in her left ear. She is speaking and looking toward the interviewer. The interviewer, a white person with curly, light brown hair, wears a dark jacket and a bracelet on their right wrist. They hold a microphone with a green windscreen toward the woman. The camera employs deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring that everyone in the background, including a person wearing a white head covering, is in focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit setting with a grainy, film-like quality, a person's arm extends from the left, holding a microphone with a bright green, round foam windscreen towards a woman. The woman stands in front of a dark doorway, inside of which a yellow and green sign is partially visible. An overlay of white subtitles appears at the bottom of the screen, displaying the text, \"And that beautiful nature,\" which then changes to, \"But you're afraid that will be lost with the new plans.\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up of a woman being interviewed. As the camera zooms out, the interviewer enters the frame, and the shot transitions to a medium shot. Throughout the video, other people remain visible in the background.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a woman positioned on the right side of the frame. An arm holding a microphone with a green windscreen extends from the bottom-left foreground toward her. As the camera zooms out, the shot transitions to a medium shot, revealing the interviewer, who now occupies the left side of the frame in the middle ground. The woman remains on the right, also in the middle ground, with the microphone held between them. In the background, a doorway is visible behind the woman, and another person can be seen on the far right. White subtitles are consistently positioned at the bottom of the frame.",
