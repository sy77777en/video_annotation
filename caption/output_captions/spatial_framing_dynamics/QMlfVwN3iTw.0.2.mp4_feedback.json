    "pre_caption": "A static full shot, filmed from a high-angle, overhead perspective, shows two square photographs and a small frame on a dark surface. The two photographs are positioned in the center-right of the frame, lying flat in the middle ground. The black-and-white photo is to the left of the color photo. Directly above them, in the top-center of the frame and also in the middle ground, is a small, rectangular, string-like object. The entire arrangement is set against a dark, speckled surface that serves as the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Two square photographs are arranged side-by-side on a dark, textured surface. The photograph on the left is in black and white and shows a row of traditional, multi-story gabled houses along a canal, with their reflections visible in the water. The photograph on the right is in color with a faded, vintage aesthetic. It features a different set of more modern buildings with balconies, separated from a wide, light-colored, sandy area by a body of water, under a cloudy sky. Above the two photographs is a small, rectangular object constructed from a light-green, string-like material, with dark beads at its four corners, though one edge lacks the string-like material.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set against a dark, speckled surface. Two square photographs are placed side-by-side, with the black-and-white photograph positioned in the center of the entire frame, showing traditional gabled buildings along a canal with their reflections in the water. The faded color photograph is to the right of the center, depicting more modern-style buildings under a cloudy sky, with a light, sandy-colored area in the foreground. Above these two images, a small, rectangular frame made of light green material is affixed to the surface with dark, round pins, though the edge next to the photos lacks any string-like material.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
