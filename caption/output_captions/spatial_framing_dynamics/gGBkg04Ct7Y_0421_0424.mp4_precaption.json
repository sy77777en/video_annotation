    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with light brown skin, long dark hair tied back, a goatee, and a thin mustache is centered in the video. He wears a dark gray t-shirt with a large yellow graphic of a Buddha-like head that has a circular ornament on its forehead. A small, dark earring is visible in his left ear. He faces forward, singing or speaking with an open mouth and making expressive gestures with his hands. White text is overlaid in the bottom corners; on the left, it reads \"SONG SPEED 50%\" and \"24 FPS,\" and on the right, it reads \"MUSIC BY @KOMBAT_K.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set in an indoor room with white walls, illuminated by a green light. The back wall features two large black, wedge-shaped acoustic foam panels arranged in a diamond pattern on the left and right sides, while a smaller panel is positioned in the center, hung in a square shape. Centered above the panels is a black, stylized emblem of a dragon or serpent forming an infinity symbol. To the left, a portion of a microphone on a stand with a pop filter is visible. The scene contains white overlay text in the lower corners. The bottom-left corner displays \"SONG SPEED 50%\" and \"24 FPS,\" while the bottom-right corner shows \"MUSIC BY @KOMBAT_K.\" A person is positioned in the center, gesturing while facing the camera.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The camera is positioned at his level. In the background, acoustic foam panels are arranged on the wall behind him, with a dragon emblem centered above his head. A microphone is partially visible in the left middle ground. Text overlays are in the foreground, with \"SONG SPEED 50% / 24 FPS\" in the bottom-left corner and \"MUSIC BY @KOMBAT_K\" in the bottom-right. The man's hands begin raised and spread apart toward the top corners of the frame, then move down and together in the lower center before separating again.",
