    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, ornate clock is centrally featured on the facade of a light-colored stone building at night. The clock face is circular, white, and illuminated from behind, causing it to glow. It has black Roman numerals and intricate black hands. The clock is set within a large, carved stone arch. Below the clock, the words \"PARIS-ORLEANS\" are carved into the stone in a dark, capitalized font. The building is occasionally illuminated by lights that cover its entire facade, highlighting its detailed architectural features against a dark, cloudy sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, an upward-facing shot captures the illuminated facade of a grand, stone building under a dark, overcast sky. Centered in the frame is a large, circular clock set within an ornate arch. The clock face is backlit, glowing white with black Roman numerals and intricate black hands pointing to approximately 2:10, and its inner gears are visible through the translucent surface. The building's light-colored stone masonry is occasionally illuminated by flashlights, highlighting detailed carvings and the words \"PARIS-ORLEANS\" inscribed beneath the clock. An overlay in the bottom right corner contains the text \"MATHIEU STANI\u0106\" with \"CINEMATOGRAPHER\" below it.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot, centered on a large, illuminated clock on a building's facade, which is positioned in the middle ground. The surrounding ornate stone architecture fills the frame, also in the middle ground, with the text \"PARIS-ORLEANS\" visible at the bottom center. The dark sky is visible in the background at the top of the frame, and a text overlay is positioned in the foreground at the bottom right. The camera is positioned below the clock, looking up. Throughout the shot, there is a very slow and subtle push-in, causing the framing on the central clock to gradually tighten.",
