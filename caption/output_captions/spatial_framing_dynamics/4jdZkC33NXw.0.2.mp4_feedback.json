    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture a quiet residential street, with no main subject present. The street runs from the bottom center of the frame into the background, creating a strong sense of depth. Modern houses are positioned on both the left and right sides of the frame, occupying the middle ground and extending toward the background. Utility poles and overhead wires line both sides of the street, starting from the foreground at the bottom left and right and receding into the background, emphasizing the perspective. The wet pavement, reflecting the overcast sky, dominates the lower center and foreground of the frame. Small trees and hedges are visible along the sidewalks on both sides, mostly in the middle ground. Vehicles are visible in the distant background at the center of the frame. The camera is positioned at approximately street level, matching the height of the houses and utility poles, and remains stationary, maintaining a consistent perspective throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a quiet residential street lined with modern houses and lush greenery on a rainy day. The wet pavement reflects the overcast sky, and utility poles with a web of wires stretch along the road, emphasizing the urban environment. There is no main subject in the video, as the focus is on the tranquil atmosphere, the interplay of architecture and nature, and the sense of scale created by the receding street, rather than any specific object or individual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, shows a quiet residential street in a suburban neighborhood on a rainy day. The scene is outdoors, with wet asphalt reflecting the overcast sky and the muted colors of the surroundings. Modern houses with light-colored facades and dark roofs line both sides of the street, separated by low hedges and small trees with green leaves. Utility poles and overhead wires run parallel to the road, adding vertical lines to the scene. The sidewalks are bordered by neatly trimmed bushes, and the rain has left the pavement glistening. The overall atmosphere is calm, with no visible pedestrians, and vehicles are visible in the background at the center of the frame. The distant view reveals more houses and greenery under a cloudy sky. There are no overlays or additional visual elements present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
