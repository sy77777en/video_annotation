    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a man is initially positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, walking away from the camera down a narrow alley. The alley is flanked by buildings on the left and right, with potted plants in the foreground and middle ground along both sides, and a banner strung overhead in the middle ground. A translucent woman on a bicycle appears in the middle ground on the right, moving from the background toward the foreground before vanishing. The man, remaining in the center, turns his head to the right. As he proceeds, a second translucent woman materializes, standing still in the middle ground on the left. The man then turns his head to the left to look at her. Throughout the sequence, the camera remains at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a man with short, dark hair, viewed mostly from behind as he walks down a narrow alley. He is wearing a brown short-sleeved polo shirt, light blue trousers, and a dark watch on his left wrist. As he proceeds, two translucent, ghostly figures of a woman momentarily appear. The first figure is a woman in a patterned, short-sleeved dress, seen riding a bicycle. The second figure is a woman in a light-colored, sleeveless dress with her hair styled up, who appears standing on the left side of the alley, looking down at something she is holding and does not disappear. The man first turns his head to look at the woman riding past on a bicycle, and then turns his head again to observe the woman who is standing.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person over-the-hip POV shot frames a man from the hip up as he walks down a narrow, sunlit alleyway during the day. The alley is flanked by two-story buildings, with a blue wall and numerous potted green plants on the left, and a grey metal gate on the right. A long fabric banner, half light blue and half pale yellow, is strung overhead between the buildings. As the man proceeds, a translucent, glowing overlay of a woman periodically materializes in the alley, at times riding a bicycle and at other times standing still.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
