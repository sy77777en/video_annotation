    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of this animated video is a white, twin-engine passenger airplane positioned in the midground on an airport taxiway. The aircraft, shown from a front-three-quarters view with its landing gear down, is at the head of a queue. Behind it, also in the midground, is a white, four-engine passenger jet. In the background, a third and a fourth aircraft are visible. All four airplanes are lined up on a curving taxiway in a dark, low-light setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor airport setting at night, with several commercial airplanes positioned in sequence along a curved taxiway surrounded by patches of grass and intersecting paved paths. The environment is dimly lit, with the aircraft illuminated by soft, artificial lighting that highlights their metallic surfaces and smooth, streamlined shapes. The planes are uniformly white, with visible engines and landing gear. The background is dark, with no visible terminal buildings or other structures, emphasizing the open expanse of the airfield. There are no overlays, text, or additional visual elements present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "This wide shot frames a twin-engine passenger airplane in the foreground and center of the scene, positioned on an airport taxiway. In the middle ground, to the left, a second, four-engine airplane is visible in the queue. Further into the background and to the left, two more airplanes are lined up, creating a curved line that recedes from the foreground center to the background left. The taxiway is surrounded by dark grassy areas. The scene is captured from a high-angle perspective, with the camera positioned above the airplanes, and the shot remains static.",
