    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic orbital scenery shot depicting a large-scale bombardment of Earth from space. The planet's curved horizon is visible against the blackness of space, with its surface covered in a dynamic layer of white clouds. Multiple bright, fiery explosions detonate across the globe, sending out massive, expanding shockwaves that push the clouds away in concentric circles. Thin, white trails, resembling missiles, streak through the upper atmosphere, converging on the planet's surface. The absence of a main subject serves to emphasize the overwhelming scale and catastrophic nature of the event, focusing the viewer's attention on the widespread environmental destruction rather than a specific object or character.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a vantage point in space, the curved horizon of the Earth is set against the darkness of the upper atmosphere and space. A vast layer of white clouds covers the land and sea below. Across the visible surface, multiple bright, fiery explosions erupt, their numbers increasing throughout the scene. Each detonation creates a large, expanding circular shockwave of orange and yellow light that pushes the clouds outward, forming distinct rings. Numerous thin, white trails, resembling contrails, arc through the atmosphere, descending toward the Earth's surface and initiating the bright fiery explosions.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot with no main subject, focusing on a planetary event. From a high-angle orbital perspective, the Earth's curved horizon spans the top of the frame, with its cloud-covered surface occupying the lower two-thirds and the blackness of space filling the top third. Initially, two bright explosions detonate in the middle ground near the center of the frame. As the scene progresses, numerous additional explosions erupt across the planet's visible surface, appearing in the foreground at the bottom of the frame and spreading across the middle ground. Each explosion expands in a circular shockwave. Concurrently, thin white trails continuously arc from the background at the top and sides of the frame, descending toward impact points in the middle ground and foreground. The camera remains static in its high-angle position, observing the escalating event from above.",
