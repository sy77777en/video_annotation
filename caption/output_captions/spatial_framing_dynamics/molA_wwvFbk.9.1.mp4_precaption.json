    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark, wooded area at night, a man with dark hair, wearing a blue long-sleeved shirt, stands on a tall, staircase-like structure. Initially positioned in the center of the frame, he shifts to slightly above the center as the camera zooms out. He is near the top, looking downwards towards some equipment mounted in front of him. The structure he is on is red. As the view widens, a second person, whose features are obscured by the darkness, is revealed at the base of the staircase, holding onto it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A dark, wooded area is shown at night, with the scene shrouded in deep shadow. Numerous bare trees and some covered in ivy populate the dense forest. A person is positioned on an elevated red structure set amongst the trees. The perspective zooms out, revealing more of the dark, forested surroundings. After zooming out, a second person enters from the bottom of the frame and eventually positions themselves in the lower-middle part of the frame. A bright light source becomes visible in the upper-right corner of the frame.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a full shot of a man standing on the stairs. As the camera zooms out, another person emerges from the bottom of the frame; finally, it presents a wide shot of them.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, standing on a red staircase-like structure. He is framed by dark trees in the foreground and background. As the camera zooms out, the shot transitions to a wide shot, causing the man to shift to the upper-center of the frame. This movement reveals a second person in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, holding the base of the structure. The final composition shows the first man in the upper-center middle ground and the second person in the lower-center foreground, surrounded by the dark, wooded environment, with a light source becoming visible in the upper-right background. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
