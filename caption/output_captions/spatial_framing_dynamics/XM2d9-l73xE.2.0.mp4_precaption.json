    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a worm's-eye view looking up, two men with fair skin are visible at the opening of a container. The man on the left is wearing a dark hat and a white collared shirt, while the man on the right, who has gray hair and appears somewhat bald, is also wearing a white collared shirt. The man on the right holds a clear container and pours a transparent liquid from it. As the liquid is poured, the view of the men becomes progressively obscured and distorted, with their features blurring behind the splashing fluid.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a worm's-eye view inside a narrow, cylindrical tube, the view looks up toward a circular opening where two figures are visible. The interior of the tube is dark, with bright, cool-toned blue and white light beams radiating down from the top, creating a starburst effect. Transparent liquid begins to fill the space, diffusing the light and partially obscuring the view of the figures and the opening above.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera is positioned at the bottom of a stainless steel container, capturing from a worm\u2019s-eye view the process in which two people at the container\u2019s opening, showing only their heads and upper bodies, pour liquid into it.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "From a worm's-eye view at the bottom of a container, the shot frames two men's heads and upper bodies in the background, visible through a circular opening at the top center of the frame. One man is positioned on the top-left of the opening, while the other is on the top-right. The dark interior of the container occupies the foreground and middle ground, with beams of light radiating from the top. A clear container is introduced from the top-right, and a transparent liquid is poured from the background down towards the foreground camera. As the liquid moves through the middle ground and into the foreground, it splashes and fills the space, progressively distorting and obscuring the view of the men in the background, whose images become warped and blurred.",
