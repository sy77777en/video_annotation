    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video, presented from a first-person perspective through a green night-vision filter, features a soldier positioned slightly to the center-left of the view. This soldier, identified by a temporary overlay as \"Captain Price,\" is seen from the back, wearing a helmet, a tactical vest over a long-sleeved shirt, and a large backpack with various pouches and straps. A coiled white rope is attached to the lower part of their gear. The first-person view shows the observer's gloved hands holding a rifle equipped with a red dot sight. Subtitles initially appear at the bottom of the screen, displaying dialogue from Price: \"Stay hidden and only engage when you have to. If Hadir's in Barkov's house, we need a chance to find him,\" but they disappear later in the video. Additional heads-up display elements include a vertical bar with numbers on the left, a battery icon displaying \"100%\" to its right at the bottom-left, and a reticle in the center of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, filmed as if seen directly through the character\u2019s eyes, captures a scene in a dark forest at night. The entire view is rendered in a monochromatic green hue, consistent with night vision. The camera follows a soldier in full tactical gear, including a large backpack, as they move through the dense undergrowth and past thick tree trunks. In the foreground, the barrel and red dot sight of a rifle are visible. A heads-up display is overlaid on the scene, featuring a vertical gauge with numbers on the left side, a battery icon showing \"100%\" on the bottom left, and a crosshair in the center of the frame. At the bottom of the screen, subtitles read, \"Price: Stay hidden and only engage when you have to. If Hadir's in Barkov's house, we need a chance to find him,\" with \"Price:\" displayed in green and the rest in white. An overlay briefly identifies the other soldier as \"Captain Price.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",
    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye level, the viewer's rifle occupies the foreground, positioned in the bottom-right and bottom-center of the frame. In the middle ground, another soldier is initially positioned slightly to the left of the center, with the dark forest environment filling the middle ground and background. The soldier then turns and walks forward and to the right, moving deeper into the middle ground of the scene. The camera follows this movement, advancing forward and panning slightly to the right to track the soldier. Various heads-up display elements are overlaid on the screen: a vertical bar is on the left, an icon is at the bottom-left, subtitles appear at the bottom, and a reticle is fixed in the center.",
