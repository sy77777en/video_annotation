    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a glass is initially seen tilted in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground above a dark surface in the foreground. The glass falls toward the bottom of the frame, makes contact with the foreground surface, and then bounces back up into the center, tumbling horizontally through the middle ground. It falls a second time, striking the surface at the bottom center of the frame and shattering. The resulting fragments expand outward from the point of impact, scattering across the lower portion of the frame in the middle ground. The camera remains stationary and positioned at the subject's level throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A tall, clear, transparent pilsner-style glass with a thick, heavy base and a slightly flared rim is shown tilted against a black background. The glass then shatters upon impact, breaking apart into numerous sharp, jagged shards of varying sizes. The process reveals the thinness of the glass walls as it disintegrates from a whole object into a collection of broken pieces.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a solid black background, a clear, empty beer glass tumbles in slow motion. It falls toward a dark, flat surface at the bottom of the scene. Upon impact, the glass shatters, sending a multitude of sharp, glistening fragments and shards flying outward. The high-contrast lighting starkly illuminates the transparent glass and its pieces as they break apart against the dark, undefined space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
