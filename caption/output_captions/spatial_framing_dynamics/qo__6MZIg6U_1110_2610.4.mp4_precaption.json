    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a brightly lit, futuristic setting, three men are engaged in a lightsaber duel. One man, with red and black facial tattoos and small horns on his head, is dressed in black robes and wields a double-bladed red lightsaber. He is fighting two other men. The first of his opponents is a man with long brown hair and a beard, wearing off-white robes with a dark belt, who wields a green lightsaber. The second opponent is a younger man with shorter brown hair and a small braid on one side, also dressed in off-white robes with a dark belt, who uses a blue lightsaber.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an expansive, futuristic indoor chamber, the scene is framed by large, stone-like pillars leading into an area with a smooth, grey floor. The space is dominated by several massive, cylindrical columns that emit an intense, bright white light, creating a hazy, high-contrast atmosphere. On both the left and right sides, circular floor consoles are positioned. In the background, a walkway is visible, and beyond it, a dark, complex structure dotted with small lights can be seen. Three figures move rapidly through the chamber, their glowing lightsabers\u2014one red, one green, and one blue\u2014creating streaks of color and bright flashes as they clash.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, framed between two large pillars in the foreground, showing a man in black positioned in the center middle ground. A man with a green lightsaber enters from the right side of the frame, moving from the foreground into the middle ground to confront the central figure. The shot then widens to a full shot as a man with a blue lightsaber enters from the left, positioning himself on the left side of the central figure while the man with the green lightsaber takes the right. All three subjects are now in the middle ground, with the man in black at the center. He then spins, forcing his opponents to move apart toward the left and right sides of the frame, expanding their formation across the middle ground. Throughout the sequence, large, brightly lit columns dominate the background, and the camera remains at the subjects' level.",
