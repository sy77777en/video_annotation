    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, offering a level-angle, symmetrical view down a long urban canyon. The perspective is framed by towering modern residential buildings on either side, leading the eye down a straight street with distant traffic. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale and architectural density of the environment, creating an atmospheric and imposing mood. This is enhanced by the low sun, which casts both sides of the street into deep shadow while partially illuminating the tall buildings with a warm, golden light, highlighting the textures of glass and concrete across the numerous skyscrapers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a view looking down a city street canyon flanked by modern, tall residential buildings. The scene is set during sunrise or sunset, casting a warm, golden light on the faces of the buildings on both sides of the street. Below, traffic moves along the road, and a green space with trees is visible to the left. An overlay of the words \"EXTREME VENGEANCE\" in a large, metallic gold, 3D font appears in the center of the view and then disappears.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot captured from a static, high-angle perspective. The extreme wide shot is symmetrically framed by tall buildings in the left and right foreground, creating a deep view down a long street that runs from the bottom center into the background. Other skyscrapers occupy the middle ground and background, defining the urban canyon. A title, \"EXTREME VENGEANCE,\" in a large, 3D font, appears in the center foreground, overlaid on the cityscape. The text remains for a moment before disappearing, returning the view to the unaltered scenery.",
