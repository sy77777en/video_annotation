    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases two gray, elongated shadows cast upon a brightly lit, patterned marble floor. Both shadows resemble humanoid figures holding something long and slender with a large, round top, which they appear to be playing with. The shadows are distorted with long, pointed snouts, likely due to the angle of the light casting them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle perspective looking down over a curved, dark wood railing with a gothic arch design, the scene is set within a dimly lit interior foyer. The floor below is made of large, light-colored tiles with smaller dark ones creating a pattern. A rectangular patch of warm, yellow light is cast across the floor, and within it, two long, distorted shadows move and gesticulate dynamically. In the background, a dark, ornate wooden cabinet is visible against a wall next to an arched doorway that opens into another brightly lit space.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The camera starts beside the railing on the second floor; it then moves forward and shoots from a high angle to capture a wide shot of two shadows on the ground floor.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The shot begins from a high-angle perspective, with a dark, curved wooden railing in the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame. The camera then pushes forward slightly, moving over the railing to settle into a wide shot looking down onto the ground floor. In this composition, the railing remains in the foreground, framing the bottom of the shot. The middle ground is dominated by a brightly lit, patterned marble floor where two long, dynamic shadows are cast in the center. In the background, an ornate wooden cabinet is positioned on the left, and an arched doorway leading to another lit room is positioned in the center-right. The camera maintains its high position, looking down on the scene throughout the shot.",
