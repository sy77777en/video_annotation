    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, initially facing away from the camera, turns to reveal his side profile as he walks into a dark, gated entrance of a dilapidated building. He is dressed in a long, dark overcoat that falls below his knees. Strapped directly behind him is a long, slender object, possibly a sword in its scabbard. His figure is silhouetted against the daylight illuminating the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a desolate, foggy outdoor area with muddy, debris-strewn ground. A weathered concrete structure stands in the center, bearing a sign that reads \"BEXHILL WATER AUTHORITY\" above a small door serving as the entryway. To the left of the entrance is a cylindrical, barred enclosure, while an adjacent building to the right has a faded sign for \"Hardwick Marin.\" The architecture is grimy and stained, with visible graffiti. The entire scene is cast in a dim, hazy light with a desaturated, greenish-gray color palette. A figure in a dark coat stands at the entrance of the water authority building, remaining there as the fog swirls around.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a static wide shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, standing within the entrance of a building. Debris is scattered across the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The central building is flanked by a cylindrical, barred structure on the left and an adjacent building on the right, all situated in the middle ground. The man, initially seen from behind, turns slightly and walks deeper into the dark entrance, moving further into the middle ground and away from the camera. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the subject's level.",
