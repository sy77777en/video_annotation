    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot of a man standing in the center-left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground behind a long, candlelit dinner table that stretches across the scene. Guests are seated in the foreground on the right and in the middle ground on the left. The focus then racks from the man to a woman in the foreground, transitioning the shot to a close-up. In the final composition, the woman is positioned on the right side of the frame in profile, while the man and the candles to his left become blurred elements in the background and middle ground. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a clear view of an older, fair-skinned man with voluminous, styled white hair standing at a long, candle-lit dinner table. He is dressed in a dark blue, high-collared jacket with gold embroidery and red cuffs, worn over a white shirt and white trousers, and he holds a glass up as if making a toast. The camera's focus then shifts, blurring the man and the background, and settles on a fair-skinned woman in the foreground, viewed in profile from the right. She has light brown, curly hair and wears large, ornate earrings with dangling gold and crystal elements. She is initially seated and looks towards the man's direction, but later turns her head to look towards the left side of the frame. Between her and the partially visible woman with dark hair adorned with yellow flowers, there are two other people.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An opulent, candlelit indoor banquet takes place in a grand dining hall. A long table is lavishly decorated with ornate silver candelabras holding numerous lit white candles, arrangements of red roses, and various dishes. In the midground, a man with white hair, dressed in a dark blue and red historical jacket, stands holding a glass. The focus shifts from the man to the guests seated in the foreground, blurring the midground into soft, circular lights and bringing a woman in profile on the right into view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",
