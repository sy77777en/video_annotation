    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot frames a large tree trunk in the foreground, occupying the right side of the frame from top to bottom. In the middle ground, a woman is positioned on the left, partially obscured by the tree. She slowly moves from the far-left edge, peeking out from behind the trunk and revealing more of her face as she shifts slightly toward the center-left. An out-of-focus forest is visible in the background on the far left. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the woman's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large tree trunk with dark, deeply textured bark is positioned in the foreground. A woman with long, platinum blonde hair and light skin slowly peeks out from behind the left side of the tree. She is wearing a black choker necklace and a dark shirt without a collar. With an alert expression, she looks to her left as her face becomes more visible, and one of her hands rests on the tree's bark.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit forest, the rough, dark-gray bark of a large tree trunk occupies the foreground. The texture of the bark is detailed and coarse. Partially obscured to the left and slightly out of focus, a woman with blonde hair and a dark choker peeks from behind the tree. The scene is characterized by a cool, low-light environment with a muted color palette.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
