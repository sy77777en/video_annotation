    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A four-bladed ceiling fan is viewed from directly below. The blades are made of dark brown wood with visible grain and decorative carvings on their surface. The central motor housing is dark, metallic, and features an ornate, multi-faceted design. Numerous irregular white patches are visible on the dark-textured ceiling wallpaper, scattered throughout the scene. In the upper left, a large piece of wallpaper has been torn, revealing irregular, ragged edges and the white wall surface beneath. This is visible against the dark gray, textured surface. As the camera moves, this piece of torn wallpaper gradually shifts to the center and lower left of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, the view is directed upward at a dark ceiling. A four-bladed ceiling fan with dark wooden blades and an ornate central metal housing is centered in the shot. The dark ceiling shows signs of damage, with a large, torn piece of white material visible on one side and numerous irregular white patches on the dark-textured ceiling wallpaper.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "In a full shot captured from below, a four-bladed ceiling fan is positioned in the center of the frame against the background of a dark ceiling. Numerous small white patches are scattered across the background. Initially, a large piece of torn wallpaper is visible in the top left of the frame. As the camera moves, this torn piece shifts from the top left, moving toward the center and then settling in the lower left of the frame, while the ceiling fan remains consistently in the center.",
