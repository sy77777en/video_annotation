    "pre_caption": "This is a static medium shot of a simulated detection apparatus. A single cable extends from the top-center of the frame into the middle ground, where it connects to a small device. This device, located in the upper-center of the frame, serves as the origin point for a fan-shaped array of thin lines that radiate downwards and outwards, stretching from the middle ground toward the textured surface that fills the background. The only movement in the scene is the continuous, repetitive motion of small white dots traveling along these lines, originating from the central device and moving down to the tips, creating a scanning effect across the background surface. The perspective is from a high angle, looking down upon the entire apparatus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This computer-generated animation shows a simulated detection apparatus against a dark, textured background resembling an uneven surface. A single, thin, white cable extends vertically from the top of the scene. Attached to the end of this cable is a small, white, conical device from which a fan-shaped array of about ten thin, white lines radiates downwards and outwards. Along each of these radiating lines, small, white dots of light repeatedly travel from the central device down to the tips of the lines, creating a continuous scanning or pulsing motion.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a dark, textured background resembling an uneven, rocky surface, a single, thin white line descends from the top center. Attached to this line is a small, white, conical object from which a fan-like array of approximately a dozen thinner white lines radiates downwards and outwards. These radiating lines, which appear to be scanning the surface below, are punctuated by small, evenly spaced white dots. The entire composition is a monochromatic graphical representation, with the white lines and dots standing out against the dark, expansive backdrop.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video appears to be a computer-generated image simulating the operation of a ground detection device. A white tube with a device attached to its end extends downward from the upper-middle part of the frame, and the device emits fan-shaped thin lines toward the ground, with white light spots moving repeatedly along these lines.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: Due to insufficient background information, it is difficult to determine the camera height relative to the subject.",
