    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a dynamic scene on a red felt billiard table, featuring several sharply focused billiard balls in the middle ground. These include a red and white striped ball, a green and white striped ball, a blue and white striped ball, a solid black ball, and a solid white ball that is in mid-air. All the balls are spherical with a glossy surface. A single hand is partially visible behind the solid white ball in the blurry background, while a solid yellow ball is in the blurry foreground. The action unfolds as the solid white ball drops and strikes the solid yellow ball, which then becomes the main focus. The yellow ball rolls across the table before dropping into the pocket and disappearing from view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor scene with a close-up view of a pool table covered in red felt. Initially, several billiard balls are scattered on the table in sharp focus in the midground, including a red and white striped ball, a green and white striped ball, a blue and white striped ball, a solid black ball, and a solid white ball that appears to be in mid-air. A single hand is partially visible behind the solid white ball in the blurry background. In the blurry foreground, there is a solid yellow ball. As the solid white ball drops and strikes the solid yellow ball, the yellow ball becomes the main focus, rolling across the table before disappearing from view. During this sequence, all other balls and the hand move out of frame as the camera shifts, revealing the dark and silver edges of the pool table. Some embossed patterns are visible in the silver portion of the table's corner. The scene is dimly lit and defined by a shallow depth of field, which leaves most of the red surface indistinct.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video starts with a wide shot of some billiard balls on the table. As the yellow ball is hit and rolls forward, the camera focuses on the yellow ball, and finally, the yellow ball rolls into the hole and disappears, then it shows a close-up shot of the billiard table.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot from a high angle, where an out-of-focus yellow ball occupies the foreground at the bottom center. Other billiard balls are positioned in the middle ground and background, including a white ball in the middle ground and others near the top left and top right of the frame. After being struck by another ball, the yellow ball rolls from the foreground toward the top left of the scene. The camera pans and tilts to track its movement, transitioning into a tighter close-up that keeps the yellow ball centered in the frame while the other balls exit the shot. The yellow ball continues to the top left corner, where it falls into a pocket and disappears, leaving a final close-up view of the table's corner.",
