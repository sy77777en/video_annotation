    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a digital cityscape scenery shot, depicting a futuristic urban environment under a bright, cloudy sky. In both the foreground and midground, simplified, block-like structures frame a view across a body of water that reflects the sky and distant buildings. The background features a dense cluster of block-like structures, including the prominent Burj Khalifa and another uniquely shaped tower. The perspective is level and wide, emphasizing the grand scale and atmosphere of the entire metropolis rather than focusing on any individual element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This is a daytime view of a city skyline, framed by large, untextured, light-gray blocks in the foreground that extend into the background. In the distance, across a body of water and further into the distance, the Burj Khalifa and another dark, modern skyscraper with a curved top rise above a collection of other blocks. The scene is set under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. An overlay of white text is visible in the top right corner, stating, \"Animations are for illustrative purposes only. The final building may differ.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot presents a digital cityscape from a low-angle perspective. Large, simple blocks in the foreground occupy the bottom left and bottom right, framing the scene. Through this opening, a body of water is visible in the central middle ground, with more block-like structures on its left and right banks. The background is dominated by a distant skyline centered in the frame, featuring two prominent skyscrapers rising above other buildings. The sky with clouds occupies the upper third of the composition. The camera executes a slow, subtle dolly-in, moving forward through the foreground structures toward the central skyline.",
