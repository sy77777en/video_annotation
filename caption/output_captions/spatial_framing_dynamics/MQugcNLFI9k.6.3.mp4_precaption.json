    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a city street filled with debris, a group of six individuals stands together in a circle. A white man with short, light brown hair, wearing a black sleeveless top, draws a black bow and arrow. Next to him, a white man with long, blond hair is dressed in black and silver armor with a red cape and holds a large, grey, blocky hammer. A white woman with short, wavy, reddish-brown hair, wearing a black, form-fitting suit, is positioned to the left of a white man in a blue, red, and white costume with a large white star on his chest and a blue helmet with a white \"A\" on the forehead, who holds a round shield with a matching star design. Completing the circle, a figure in a red and gold metallic suit of armor and a large, muscular, green-skinned figure are also part of the group.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds on a wide city street during the daytime, amidst widespread destruction. A mix of tall, classic-style and modern buildings with stone exteriors line the thoroughfare, their facades marked by damage and smoke stains. The pavement is covered with gray rubble, shattered concrete, and the wreckage of vehicles. As the camera executes a smooth counterclockwise arc with a slight downward tilt, an overturned car engulfed in bright orange flames becomes visible in the mid-ground during the latter part of the video, sending plumes of dark smoke into the hazy, debris-filled air. A group of figures stands together on a relatively open area of the concrete floor, surrounded by urban chaos. The camera arcs across this scene, capturing the full scope of the devastated metropolitan setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot that begins by framing Hawkeye in the center-left foreground and Thor in the center-right foreground, with Iron Man visible in the background between them. The camera then executes a smooth, counter-clockwise arc from right to left, dynamically reconfiguring the spatial arrangement of the subjects. As the camera moves, Black Widow is revealed more clearly in the middle ground, shifting from the right to the center-left of the frame. This movement then brings Captain America into the right foreground, while the Hulk and Iron Man become visible in the middle ground and background behind him. By the end of the arcing motion, the group is arranged in a circular formation, with a burning car appearing in the middle ground on the left, all set against a background of damaged city buildings. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
