    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A matte blue sports car is positioned on a racetrack next to a yellow and black curb. Inside the car, two people are visible through the windshield. The person in the driver's seat on the right wears a dark helmet with yellow accents. The person in the passenger seat on the left wears a white helmet.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot mounted to the left front side of a matte blue sports car, the scene captures a drive along a curving asphalt racetrack at sunset. One side of the track is lined with a yellow-and-black chevron curb, separating it from the surrounding sandy, arid landscape. In the distance, a range of mountains is silhouetted against the warm, orange glow of the low sun. Through the car's windshield, two figures wearing helmets can be seen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, the front left side of a matte blue sports car occupies the foreground and middle ground, positioned from the bottom left towards the center. A yellow and black curb is in the foreground along the bottom right edge of the frame. Through the car's windshield in the middle ground, two helmeted figures are visible, with a passenger on the left and a driver on the right. The racetrack curves from the right middle ground into the background, where a mountain range sits on the right. The setting sun is visible in the center-background through the windshield, with the sky filling the top of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
