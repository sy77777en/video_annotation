    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A 3D animated model of a toilet is depicted against a black background. The toilet is rendered in a translucent, light grey material, with light blue water visible in the bowl. The animation shows the toilet lid already open, followed by the seat remaining down. Subsequently, the tank's cover splits down the middle and opens outwards, revealing a black, cylindrical compression tank that is lowered into the main tank from above.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A semi-transparent, white toilet is initially positioned at the lower center of a solid black background. In a smooth animation, the toilet lid slowly closes from an open position. The water tank cover then splits into two halves from the middle and swings outward. Subsequently, a black cylindrical component gradually emerges above the water tank. The bowl of the toilet contains a blue liquid, and the entire object is rendered with a translucent quality that allows a view of its internal structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot of a translucent toilet positioned in the bottom center of the frame, set in the middle ground against a solid black background. The toilet's tank cover, located at the top of the toilet, splits down the middle, and its two halves swing outwards. As this happens, the shot widens to a full shot. A black, cylindrical compression tank then descends from the top center of the frame, moving down into the open toilet tank in the middle ground. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the entire sequence.",
