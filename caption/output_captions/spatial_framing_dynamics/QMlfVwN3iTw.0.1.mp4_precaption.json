    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera\u2019s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it\u2019s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don\u2019t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a row of modern, multi-story residential buildings lining a calm canal on a sunny day. The buildings feature a variety of architectural styles and materials, with facades of yellow siding, red brick, and grey brick, all characterized by large windows and balconies with either glass or metal railings. Small boats are moored along the stone embankment at the base of the buildings, which have small patios at the water level. The video lacks a specific main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall environment, showcasing the architectural harmony and peaceful atmosphere of this contemporary waterside neighborhood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A row of modern, multi-story residential buildings lines a calm canal on a sunny day. The buildings, constructed with a mix of red, brown, and yellow brick, feature numerous large windows and balconies with glass or metal railings. Small boats, including a prominent white motorboat and another partially covered by a beige tarp, are moored along the stone embankment at the base of the homes, with others visible in the distance. The water is still, reflecting the clear blue sky and a few white clouds. In the distance, a bridge is visible at the end of the waterway. The perspective slowly zooms in, providing a continuous view of the waterfront architecture.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot where a row of residential buildings occupies the left and center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. The canal is on the right, extending from the bottom right foreground into the background, where a bridge is visible. In the foreground at the bottom of the frame, several boats are moored along the buildings, with a partially covered boat on the bottom left and a white boat in the bottom center. The camera, positioned at a low angle relative to the buildings, executes a slow forward tracking shot along the canal, causing the buildings to gradually become more prominent in the frame.",
