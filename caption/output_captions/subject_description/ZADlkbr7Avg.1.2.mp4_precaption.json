    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an expansive satellite scenery shot of a major coastal metropolis, identified as Tokyo Bay. The view captures the sprawling grey expanse of the city, contrasted with dark bodies of water and patches of green terrain on the periphery. Dominating the center is a massive, dark, cross-shaped structure superimposed over the bay, suggesting a large-scale architectural or engineering plan. There is no main subject, as the shot's high-altitude perspective emphasizes the immense scale of the urban environment and the proposed megastructure within it, focusing on the overall geography and human impact rather than any individual element.",
