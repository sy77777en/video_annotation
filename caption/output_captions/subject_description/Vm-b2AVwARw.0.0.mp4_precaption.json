    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot, transitioning from a dark, pre-dawn view to a bright, sunlit day. The scene is a sprawling, modern metropolis filled with numerous skyscrapers under a vibrant blue sky with fluffy white clouds. Among the buildings, a standout structure is a tall, slender, futuristic tower with a glowing turquoise, semi-transparent appearance and a ring-like feature at its apex, standing near another exceptionally tall, dark skyscraper. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on conveying the grand scale and futuristic atmosphere of the entire urban environment rather than a specific entity. The expansive view emphasizes the vastness and architectural ambition of the city itself.",
