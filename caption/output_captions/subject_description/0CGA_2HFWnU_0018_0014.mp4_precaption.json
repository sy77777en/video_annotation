    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vast urban landscape on a clear day. There is no main subject, as the camera's high, static vantage point is intended to convey the scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than focus on a specific object or person. In the background, a majestic mountain range with snow-capped peaks stretches across the horizon under a partly cloudy blue sky. In front of this natural backdrop, the dense downtown core of a modern city rises, filled with numerous skyscrapers and high-rise buildings. The foreground consists of a greener, more residential area with lower-rise apartment buildings and houses interspersed with lush, leafy trees, creating a layered perspective from the neighborhood to the bustling city center and the mountains beyond.",
