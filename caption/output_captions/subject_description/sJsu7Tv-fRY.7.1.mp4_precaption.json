    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a static cityscape scenery shot featuring a massive, multi-story apartment building set behind a tranquil body of water. The long, uniform structure, with its countless balconies, stretches across the background under a flat, overcast sky. Lush green trees and dense foliage frame the building and line the banks of the dark, rippling water in the foreground. There is no main subject, as the composition emphasizes the scale of the man-made structure in contrast with the surrounding natural environment. The focus is on establishing a specific place and a quiet, slightly somber atmosphere.",
