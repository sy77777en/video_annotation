    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static cityscape scenery shot featuring a row of contemporary residential buildings along a canal on a bright, sunny day. The architecture is varied, with structures of different heights, some featuring traditional gabled roofs while others have modern flat roofs with terraces and rooftop gardens. The facades display a mix of colors, including white, grey, and a prominent red building, all characterized by large windows and balconies. A modern pedestrian bridge with white supports spans the canal in the foreground, with a few people crossing it. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to capture the overall architectural aesthetic and the peaceful, modern atmosphere of this urban waterside environment rather than focusing on a specific entity.",
