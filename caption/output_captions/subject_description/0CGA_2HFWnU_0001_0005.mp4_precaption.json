    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is an urban park scenery shot, capturing a quiet, summery setting. There is no main subject, as the camera's slow, ascending pan is intended to establish the environment and atmosphere rather than highlight a specific focal point. The shot begins low across a wide gravel field with a white soccer goal, then gradually rises to reveal a chain-link fence, a street with parked cars, and a multi-story brick apartment building set behind large, leafy green trees, with distant mountains appearing against the sky.",
