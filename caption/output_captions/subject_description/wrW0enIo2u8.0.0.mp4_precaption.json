    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior scenery shot, framed by a dark doorway, that looks into a dimly lit, reddish-brown corner. A ball of fire hovers in the center of the space, its flickering flames casting a warm glow on the textured walls and illuminating small, floating embers. On the floor below, two narrow, glowing blue channels create a stark color contrast with the fiery scene. There is no main subject because the shot's purpose is to establish a mysterious and intense atmosphere, with the focus placed on the environmental composition and mood rather than a specific entity.",
