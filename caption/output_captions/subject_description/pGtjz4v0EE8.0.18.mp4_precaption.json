    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is an architectural scenery shot, featuring a low-angle perspective looking up at a massive, cylindrical stone tower. The structure is composed of multiple stacked tiers, each encircled by an open gallery of slender columns and rounded arches, creating a repeating, intricate pattern against a vibrant blue sky filled with drifting white clouds. The focus is not on a specific subject performing an action, but rather on the overall atmosphere, emphasizing the monumental scale and grandeur of the architecture in relation to the vast, dynamic sky.",
