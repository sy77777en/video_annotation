    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a historical, black-and-white cityscape scenery shot overlooking a hazy urban waterway. The wide, distant view captures a bustling port or river, filled with numerous boats of varying sizes, from small vessels in the foreground to larger barges further back. In the background, the faint outlines of multi-story buildings and industrial structures define the city's skyline through the fog. There is no main subject, as the camera's broad perspective is used to establish a sense of place and scale, focusing on the overall atmosphere of the busy waterfront environment rather than any specific person, boat, or building.",
