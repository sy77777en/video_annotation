    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing a sprawling urban landscape set against a dramatic backdrop of towering, partially snow-capped mountains under a partly cloudy blue sky. The foreground is filled with a mix of low-rise residential buildings and abundant green trees, leading into a dense midground cluster of downtown skyscrapers and high-rises. There is no single main subject, as the camera's distant perspective is intended to emphasize the grand scale and atmosphere of the location. The focus is on the expansive environment and the juxtaposition of urban development with the vast natural landscape, rather than on a specific object or building.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
