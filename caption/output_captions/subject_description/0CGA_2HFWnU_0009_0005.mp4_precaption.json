    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot that blends urban and natural elements. The scene opens on a sprawling city skyline, characterized by a dense cluster of high-rise buildings, set against a majestic backdrop of hazy mountains under a partly cloudy blue sky. The foreground is dominated by the lush, green canopies of large deciduous trees, which initially obscure the immediate surroundings. As the camera gently pans downward, it reveals a quiet residential street with a multi-story apartment building, a few cars, and a lone pedestrian, all framed by the verdant foliage. There is no main subject in this shot; the focus is on capturing the expansive atmosphere and the harmonious coexistence of urban development with the surrounding natural landscape. The camera's movement serves to reveal the scale and layers of the environment rather than to follow a specific object or person.",
