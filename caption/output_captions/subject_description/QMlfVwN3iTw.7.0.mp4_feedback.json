    "pre_caption": "The video presents a static cityscape scenery shot of a row of modern, multi-story townhouses built directly on the edge of a canal. The buildings display a unique and varied architectural style, with boxy structures in a palette of white, dark grey, yellow-ochre, and olive green, all featuring large glass windows and balconies. Several small boats, including a prominent red one, are moored along the waterfront in the rippling green water. There is no single main subject, as the composition focuses on the collective architectural character of the street and the tranquil, waterfront atmosphere. The shot's purpose is to establish a sense of place rather than highlight a specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
