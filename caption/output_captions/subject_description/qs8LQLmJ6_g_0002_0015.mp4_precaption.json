    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video captures a wide, static aerial cityscape scenery shot. The composition intentionally lacks a single main subject; instead, the focus is on the expansive scale of the location and the serene atmosphere of the moment. A long, straight road with light traffic runs through the center of a densely built town nestled within a valley. The scene is framed by layers of dark, hazy mountains that recede into the distance. A brilliant golden sun is setting directly behind the central mountain range, casting a warm, orange and pink glow across the sky and bathing the entire landscape in the soft light of dusk.",
