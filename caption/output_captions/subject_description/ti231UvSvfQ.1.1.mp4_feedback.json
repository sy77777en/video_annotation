    "pre_caption": "The video presents a vast and desolate landscape scenery shot, where the focus is on the immense scale and stark atmosphere of the arctic environment rather than a single subject. A massive, jagged iceberg with distinct, stepped layers occupies the foreground, its form cast in a cool, blue-white shadow. Beyond this icy behemoth, the dark, calm water is broken by a brilliant patch of reflected sunlight, upon which the tiny, dark silhouette of a lone boat is visible. In the far distance, a range of snow-covered mountains is partially obscured by low-hanging clouds and mist, enhancing the sense of isolation and grandeur.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
