    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an aerial seascape scenery shot, captured from a high, tilted angle looking down upon a vast expanse of water. The deep teal ocean is covered in a fine texture of countless small ripples, stretching out towards a hazy horizon. In the upper portion of the frame, a soft, bright light, likely the sun, diffuses through the atmosphere, illuminating a single, dark, and wispy cloud formation that drifts across the pale sky. The composition intentionally lacks a main subject, directing the viewer's focus instead to the immense scale of the ocean and the serene, atmospheric quality of the scene.",
