    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static residential scenery shot, capturing a tranquil suburban street in Japan on a bright, sunny day. The central focus is a two-story house that blends traditional and modern architectural elements, most notably its prominent, glossy blue-grey tiled roof (kawara). Below the roof, the house features dark-framed windows and light-colored siding. A meticulously manicured Japanese garden, with sculpted pine trees and shrubs including one with vibrant red foliage, occupies the front yard, enclosed by a brown metal fence and a low block wall. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to convey the peaceful atmosphere and aesthetic of the environment, focusing on the interplay of architecture, nature, and the clear blue sky with fluffy clouds rather than a specific person or action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
