    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural model scenery shot, offering an aerial perspective of a modern building complex. The two main structures are multi-story, with light-colored facades, numerous windows, and intricate glass-and-steel roofs, connected by a central, arched glass canopy. These detailed buildings stand in stark contrast to the surrounding environment, which is rendered as a simplified, all-white, blocky cityscape with stylized, low-poly trees in the foreground. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is placed on the architectural design and the scale of the development as a whole, emphasizing the environment and overall aesthetic rather than any single element.",
