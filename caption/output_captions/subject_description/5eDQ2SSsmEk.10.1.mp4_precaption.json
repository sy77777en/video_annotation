    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a moody cityscape scenery shot depicting a dark, futuristic urban environment being drenched by heavy rain at night. A large, cylindrical building is illuminated by powerful spotlights, their beams cutting through the thick, foggy air. Attached to the building is a large billboard featuring Asian characters and an advertisement for beer, with a smaller sign for \"SUSHI\" glowing underneath. The scene is bathed in a cool, blue-teal light, creating a dystopian and atmospheric mood, which is punctuated by a single, vertical yellow neon light high up on the structure. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish the immersive, cyberpunk setting. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere rather than a specific character or object. The partially visible vehicle in the foreground simply adds to the sense of place.",
