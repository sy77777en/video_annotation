    "pre_caption": "This is a tranquil cityscape scenery shot capturing a wide river at sunset. In the distance, the silhouette of a modern city skyline, including a prominent, large building under construction, is visible against a hazy, golden sky where a few birds are flying. The setting sun reflects brightly on the water's surface, where several small, traditional boats are scattered. In the immediate foreground, a small, rustic wooden hut with a simple roof stands on the grassy riverbank, silhouetted against the bright water. The video lacks a main subject, as the composition emphasizes the overall serene atmosphere and the juxtaposition of the natural, rural foreground with the distant urban landscape. The focus is on the environmental mood created by the golden light of sunset rather than any specific object or action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
