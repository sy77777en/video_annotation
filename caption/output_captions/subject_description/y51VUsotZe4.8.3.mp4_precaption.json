    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a high-angle cityscape scenery shot looking down a narrow, densely packed street in a bustling city at night. The scene is dominated by a multitude of vertical and horizontal neon signs, glowing in green, red, and yellow, with Chinese characters illuminating the dark alleyway between tall, shadowy buildings. Below, a crowd of people moves through the street, adding to the sense of constant activity. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on capturing the vibrant, almost overwhelming atmosphere and the dense urban texture of the environment. The shot emphasizes the scale and energy of the city street rather than any individual element within it.",
