    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic cityscape scenery shot, capturing a powerful storm system as it engulfs an urban area in a time-lapse sequence. The sky is a churning mass of ominous, dark grey clouds that roll and billow with incredible speed, with a large, dense rain shaft visible on the left. Below this atmospheric turmoil, the city appears small, featuring a multi-story parking garage, a lot filled with cars, and a high-rise building under construction, marked by a tall crane. There is no single main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the overwhelming scale and force of the natural weather event, with the cityscape serving primarily as a reference to emphasize the storm's immensity.",
