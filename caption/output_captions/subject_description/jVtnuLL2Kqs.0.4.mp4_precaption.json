    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping cityscape scenery shot featuring Buckingham Palace and the Victoria Memorial in London. The grand, neoclassical palace stands in the background under a partly cloudy sky, while the ornate, white marble Victoria Memorial, topped with a gilded bronze statue of Victory, is positioned centrally. Manicured gardens with vibrant red flowers and lush green lawns frame the foreground, with a road and trees bordering the iconic location. There is no main subject, as the camera's broad perspective is intended to capture the expansive and iconic atmosphere of the location, emphasizing the scale and grandeur of the environment rather than focusing on a specific person or object.",
