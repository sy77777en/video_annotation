    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot, presenting a rapid, panning view of an arid, mountainous terrain as seen through a pair of binoculars. The dusty, brown slopes and rocky outcrops are blurred by the swift movement, framed by the characteristic double-circle vignette of the optics. There is no main subject because the focus is on the act of surveillance and the vast, empty scale of the environment, emphasizing a sense of searching or reconnaissance over a specific point of interest.",
