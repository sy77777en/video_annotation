    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot of a large, wooded RV park. Numerous recreational vehicles, including large Class A and smaller Class C motorhomes, are parked in designated spots along a winding, paved road. The park is filled with mature, leafy green trees that provide ample shade over the campsites, which are situated on grassy and dirt areas. There is no main subject in the video; the camera's slow pan is intended to capture the overall environment and atmosphere of the campground. The focus is on showcasing the scale and layout of the park rather than highlighting a specific object or person.",
