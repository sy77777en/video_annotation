    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot, specifically a time-lapse of a stormy sunset over a distant mountain range. The sky is filled with dark, heavy clouds, but breaks in the cloud cover reveal vibrant patches of pink and red, illuminated by the setting sun. As the video progresses, these bright colors quickly fade, and the entire sky darkens into ominous shades of grey, with the last vestiges of light disappearing from the horizon. The focus is on the vast, changing atmosphere of the skyscape rather than a specific object, using the environmental shift to create a powerful and moody visual experience. The sheer scale of the cloud formations and the fading light are the central elements, emphasizing the natural spectacle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
