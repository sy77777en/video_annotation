    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot focusing on the entrance of a historic-style building. There is no main subject as the composition is designed to establish a sense of place and atmosphere, emphasizing the building's character rather than a specific entity. The off-white facade features a central arched wooden door, above which a sign reads \"HOTEL PROVINCIAL\" in blue lettering with a gold outline. The entrance is flanked by two dark, gas-style lanterns and two blue shields bearing a coat of arms. On the second story, a window with light blue louvered shutters and an ornate black iron railing is visible. The scene is framed by the bare, dark branches of two trees, contributing to the cool, overcast ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
