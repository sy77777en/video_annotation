    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a dynamic cityscape scenery shot from the first-person perspective of a vehicle traveling at high speed down a multi-lane highway at night. The long-exposure photography technique blurs the surrounding environment, transforming the yellow overhead streetlights and distant city lights into long, horizontal streaks against a dark blue sky. The wet asphalt reflects these glowing trails, enhancing the sense of rapid motion. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the overall atmosphere and sensation of speed within the urban environment, using the flow of light and motion to create an abstract visual experience rather than highlighting a specific object.",
