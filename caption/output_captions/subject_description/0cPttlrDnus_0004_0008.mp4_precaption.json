    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, dominated by a modern skyscraper with a dark, highly reflective glass facade that mirrors a distorted view of the urban surroundings. The building stands against a vast, hazy city that stretches into the distant hills, featuring a mix of residential towers and green spaces. To the left, a large, reddish-brown excavated area sits below several white apartment buildings, highlighting a contrast between development and raw landscape. There is no main subject because the composition is designed to capture the expansive scale and atmosphere of the urban environment, focusing on the interplay between architecture and the sprawling city rather than a specific person or object. A faint digital overlay of interconnected lines and logos is superimposed across the scene, adding a technological or data-driven aesthetic.",
