    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of the Venetian waterfront, centered on a grand, white marble church. The church features a classical facade with columns and statues, a large central dome, and two flanking bell towers. To its sides, a line of colorful buildings in shades of yellow, orange, and pink with terracotta roofs stretches along the canal. The turquoise water in the foreground ripples as the camera's perspective shifts slightly, and the lighting transitions from a warm, golden-hour glow to brighter, more direct sunlight. There is no single main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall architectural ensemble and the unique atmosphere of the city, capturing the scale and beauty of the Venetian environment rather than isolating one specific building.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
