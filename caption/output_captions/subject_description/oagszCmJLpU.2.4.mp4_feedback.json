    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic skyscape scenery shot of a powerful thunderstorm raging in the dead of night. A massive, dark cloud formation is illuminated from within by intermittent, brilliant flashes of purple and white lightning, revealing its voluminous and churning structure against the deep blackness of the sky. Above the storm, tiny, bright stars are scattered across the expanse, while a few faint blue lights glimmer on the distant, dark horizon. The video lacks a main subject, as its focus is on capturing the atmospheric grandeur and immense scale of the natural phenomenon itself. As the sequence progresses, the lightning within the cloud fades, and the storm system dissipates, leaving a clearer view of the starry night.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
