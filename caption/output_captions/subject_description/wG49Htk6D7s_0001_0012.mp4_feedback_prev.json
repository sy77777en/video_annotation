    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot that captures the overwhelming scale and atmosphere of a futuristic, dystopian metropolis at night. The video begins with a low-angle view looking up at a towering skyscraper, where a massive, blue holographic advertisement for \"SONY\" is projected onto its side, lit by a powerful spotlight. As the camera slowly tilts downward, it passes another glowing pink neon sign that reads \"EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO SEE,\" which then changes to \"EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO HEAR.\" The descent reveals the immense, dark facade of the building, with rows of dimly lit windows set against a hazy, polluted-looking sky. Further down, smaller, colorful neon signs for street-level businesses, including a green symbol and a yellow sign for a noodle shop, pierce through the gloom. There is no main subject because the shot's purpose is to establish the environment and mood; the focus is on the vast, technologically saturated, and impersonal scale of the city rather than any specific character or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
