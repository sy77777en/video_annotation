    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a waterfront scenery shot of a large marina on a cloudy, overcast day. A prominent two-story, gray-sided building with a white metal roof stands on pilings over the calm, dark water, featuring a wraparound balcony and large windows. To its left, long rows of covered boat slips with matching white roofs shelter numerous vessels. The marina is densely populated with sailboats, their tall masts creating a forest-like pattern against the water. In the background, across the bay, a distant city skyline with several high-rise buildings is visible along the tree-lined shore. The camera's slow, sweeping view captures the expansive scale and tranquil, muted atmosphere of the location, making the environment itself the subject rather than any specific object or person.",
