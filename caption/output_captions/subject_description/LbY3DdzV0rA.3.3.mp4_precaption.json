    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic desert landscape scenery shot, showcasing a powerful storm system in a time-lapse sequence. The sky is dominated by immense, turbulent clouds in shades of deep grey and purple, which swirl and evolve rapidly. A concentrated downpour, resembling a microburst, descends from the center of the cloud formation, creating a dark curtain of rain against the horizon. The foreground consists of an arid, sandy expanse with sparse, low-lying green and yellow vegetation, while the silhouettes of several tall saguaro cacti stand against the storm. There is no single main subject, as the focus is placed on the overwhelming scale and atmospheric power of the weather event in relation to the vast, open desert environment.",
