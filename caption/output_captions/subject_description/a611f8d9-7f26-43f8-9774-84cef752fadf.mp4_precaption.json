    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an urban infrastructure scenery shot capturing a point-of-view perspective from a vehicle driving through a curved, brightly lit tunnel at night. Rows of brilliant white lights line the arched ceiling and walls, their glow reflecting and refracting through numerous raindrops scattered across the windshield, creating a blurred and dynamic visual effect. There is no main subject because the focus is on the immersive atmosphere and the environmental experience of traveling through the structure. The shot emphasizes the dynamic interplay of light and motion rather than highlighting a specific person or object.",
