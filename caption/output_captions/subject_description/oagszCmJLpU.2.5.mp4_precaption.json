    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic skyscape scenery shot of a powerful thunderstorm raging at night. There is no single main subject because the focus is on capturing the immense scale and raw energy of the atmospheric event itself. The vast, dark sky is dominated by a colossal, churning mass of storm clouds, so dark they are nearly black. The scene is intermittently and violently illuminated by flashes of lightning; some are sharp, branching bolts that crackle low on the horizon, while others are diffuse sheet lightning that lights up the interior of the clouds, casting an ominous and beautiful purple glow across the turbulent cloudscape. A few faint, distant lights twinkle along the dark, flat horizon, providing a subtle sense of scale against the overwhelming power of the storm above.",
