    "pre_caption": "This video presents a disorienting nature scenery shot, captured from a low-angle perspective looking directly up through a canopy of trees toward the sky. The entire frame is in a rapid, continuous spin, which creates a powerful radial blur effect, transforming the individual trees into abstract streaks of green and brown that radiate from the center of the image. There is no main subject because the focus is placed entirely on the environmental effect and the dizzying, vertiginous atmosphere created by the camera's motion, rather than on any specific object within the forest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
