    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot featuring an expansive field of vibrant yellow sunflowers stretching towards the horizon. The flowers are planted in neat, parallel rows that create a strong sense of perspective, drawing the eye into the distance where a cluster of dark green trees and rolling hills are visible under a pale blue sky. There is no main subject in this shot, as the focus is intentionally placed on the vastness and natural beauty of the agricultural environment. The composition emphasizes the scale of the field and the serene atmosphere of the rural setting.",
