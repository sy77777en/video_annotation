    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot depicting a vast mountain canyon under a clear night sky. The foreground is composed of the dark, silhouetted ridge of a mountain, with a couple of pine trees visible on the left. In the distance, the rugged, rocky formations of the canyon are faintly visible, while a warm, yellow glow from a distant city or town illuminates the low horizon. The focus of the video is on the immense scale of the natural environment and the serene atmosphere, rather than a specific subject. The expansive, dark blue sky is filled with countless bright stars and the faint, cloudy band of the Milky Way, creating a sense of awe and tranquility.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
