    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, dominated by a modern, glass-clad skyscraper whose reflective facade distorts the image of a nearby helipad and the surrounding environment. In the background, a sprawling urban area with numerous residential buildings extends towards hazy mountains in the distance, with a notable reddish-brown excavated cliffside visible to the left. The scene lacks a single main subject as the composition emphasizes the vast scale and complex texture of the urban landscape, creating an atmospheric view rather than focusing on a specific entity. Faint white lines and logos are overlaid on the image, forming a network pattern that adds a technological or data-driven feel to the expansive view.",
