    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot featuring a low-angle, upward-looking view of a deep blue sky filled with scattered white clouds. Cutting diagonally across the frame are two parallel concrete beams, part of an unseen structure like a bridge or overpass, detailed with small metal fixtures and a thin railing along their upper edge. There is no main subject in the video. The focus is instead on the environmental contrast between the rigid, man-made lines of the architecture and the soft, organic texture of the sky, creating an atmospheric and contemplative mood.",
