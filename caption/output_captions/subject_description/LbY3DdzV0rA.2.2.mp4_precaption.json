    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot of a desert environment being overtaken by a powerful weather event. A massive, orange-brown wall of dust, characteristic of a haboob, rapidly advances from the left, creating a stark contrast with the dark, stormy blue sky visible on the right and the white, billowing clouds above. The arid landscape in the foreground is dotted with green desert shrubs and iconic saguaro cacti, which stand before a range of rugged, dark mountains that become progressively obscured by the advancing dust cloud. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the storm itself, emphasizing the environment over any specific object within it.",
