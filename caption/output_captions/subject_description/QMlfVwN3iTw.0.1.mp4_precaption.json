    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a row of modern, multi-story residential buildings lining a calm canal on a sunny day. The buildings feature a variety of architectural styles and materials, with facades of yellow siding, red brick, and grey brick, all characterized by large windows and balconies with glass railings. Small boats are moored along the stone embankment at the base of the buildings, which have small patios at the water level. The video lacks a specific main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall environment, showcasing the architectural harmony and peaceful atmosphere of this contemporary waterside neighborhood.",
