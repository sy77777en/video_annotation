    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a dramatic, high-angle, top-down view of a narrow city alleyway at night during a rainstorm. The wet cobblestone street below reflects the dim, atmospheric glow from streetlights and windows, creating pools of light amidst deep shadows between two tall buildings. A red car is parked on the right side of the alley, while scattered boxes and a few small, indistinct figures are visible on the ground. There is no main subject; the vertiginous perspective from the rooftop emphasizes the scale of the urban environment and establishes a gritty, noir-like atmosphere, which is further enhanced by the sound of a distant siren.",
