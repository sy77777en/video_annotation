    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing the iconic waterfront of Venice, Italy, under a clear blue sky. The video pans across the ornate, Gothic facade of the Doge's Palace, with its intricate patterns and arched loggia, and also reveals the towering St. Mark's Campanile. The turquoise waters of the Venetian Lagoon are active with various boats, including a white motorboat speeding past. There is no main subject, as the camera's broad, sweeping movement is designed to showcase the magnificent scale and bustling atmosphere of the environment rather than any individual element. The focus is on the overall scene and the interplay between the historic architecture and the waterway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
