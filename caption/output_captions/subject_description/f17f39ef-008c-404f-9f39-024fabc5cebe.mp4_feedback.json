    "pre_caption": "This video presents a time-lapse scenery shot of a forest canopy, capturing the transition from dusk to deep night. The perspective is from the ground looking straight up, where the stark, black silhouettes of gnarled, leafless tree branches form an intricate network against the sky. The sky itself transforms from a pale, hazy blue to a deep, dark expanse, gradually revealing a dense field of tiny, twinkling stars. As full darkness settles, a few glowing orange embers or sparks drift slowly upwards through the frame. The video lacks a specific main subject, as its purpose is to convey an atmosphere of quiet transition and to emphasize the majestic scale of the night sky as it is revealed through the natural frame of the wintery trees.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
