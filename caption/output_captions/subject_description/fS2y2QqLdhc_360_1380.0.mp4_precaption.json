    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video is a nighttime urban scenery shot featuring a large Tesla coil generating spectacular electrical discharges in an open area. The scene is characterized by intense, branching bolts of purple and white lightning that erupt from the top of a dark, mushroom-shaped tower, crackling through the air against a backdrop of dim trees, streetlights, and city buildings. There is no main subject because the video prioritizes the atmospheric display of raw energy and the visual impact of the electrical arcs illuminating the environment, rather than focusing on a specific individual or object.",
