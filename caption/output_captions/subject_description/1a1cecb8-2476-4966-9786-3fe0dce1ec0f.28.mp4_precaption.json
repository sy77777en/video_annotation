    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic cityscape scenery shot from a street-level perspective, moving through an urban intersection. The scene is defined by the bold white stripes of a crosswalk on the dark asphalt, with the blurred forms of trees and buildings silhouetted against a bright, overcast sky. There is no main subject because the focus is on conveying the atmosphere and environment of the city street. The rapid, sweeping camera movement and resulting motion blur emphasize the overall scene and its dynamic feel rather than singling out any particular object or person. The shot's intention is to capture the experience of moving through the space itself.",
