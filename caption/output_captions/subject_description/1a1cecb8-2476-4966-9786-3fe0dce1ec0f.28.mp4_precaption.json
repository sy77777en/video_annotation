    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot from a low, wide-angle perspective, capturing an urban intersection under a bright, overcast sky. The view encompasses asphalt roads with white-painted crosswalks, traffic lights, and large, leafy trees bordering the street and nearby buildings. There is no main subject, as the camera's sweeping motion is used to establish the overall atmosphere and layout of the urban environment rather than focusing on any particular person or object. The emphasis is on the general setting and the feeling of moving through the space.",
