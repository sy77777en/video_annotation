    "pre_caption": "This is an underwater scenery shot depicting the dark and murky depths of the ocean. The view pans over a dim, indistinct seabed under a vast expanse of deep blue water, with small, light-colored particles resembling marine snow drifting slowly through the frame. A large, shadowy rock formation looms in the background. There is no main subject, as the shot is designed to convey the immense scale and mysterious atmosphere of the deep-sea environment, focusing on the vast, empty space rather than a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
