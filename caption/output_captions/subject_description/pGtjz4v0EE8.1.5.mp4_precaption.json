    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a high-angle cityscape scenery shot capturing a sprawling European city with a dense collection of buildings featuring characteristic terracotta-tiled roofs and ochre-colored walls. In the foreground on the left, a tall, ornate Gothic bell tower, constructed from white and green marble, rises majestically, providing a sense of scale. The view extends over the rooftops, revealing narrow streets bustling with tiny figures of people, and stretches towards rolling green hills in the distant background. There is no single main subject; the composition is designed to emphasize the grand scale and historic atmosphere of the urban environment rather than focusing on a specific element.",
