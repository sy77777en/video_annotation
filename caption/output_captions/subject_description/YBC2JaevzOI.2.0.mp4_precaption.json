    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dark, nighttime streetscape scenery shot. A dimly lit road curves through the frame, flanked by the silhouettes of trees barely visible against the black sky, with a car's glowing red taillights visible on the left and another vehicle faintly discernible further down the road. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the quiet, almost desolate atmosphere of the nocturnal environment. The sparse points of light from the cars serve only to accentuate the pervasive darkness rather than drawing attention to the vehicles themselves.",
