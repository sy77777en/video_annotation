    "pre_caption": "This video presents an aerial disaster scenery shot, capturing the catastrophic destruction of a large football stadium. From a high-angle perspective, the circular structure, identified by a sign as \"GIANTS STADIUM,\" is engulfed by a massive, dark, swirling shockwave that tears it apart. The stadium, with its visible red seating and green field, crumbles and disintegrates as the immense force sweeps over it. The focus is not on a specific character or object but on the overwhelming scale and power of the destructive event, emphasizing the environmental catastrophe and the atmosphere of devastation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
