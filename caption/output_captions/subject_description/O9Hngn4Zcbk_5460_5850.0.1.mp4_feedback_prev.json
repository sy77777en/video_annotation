    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a fantastical, industrial complex, blending historical and whimsical elements. The structure resembles a weathered stone castle or an old factory, featuring crenelated towers and large, arched windows, all under a massive, arched glass roof. A complex network of brightly colored pipes in red, yellow, purple, and green crisscrosses the exterior walls, while one prominent tower is painted with a red and white spiral reminiscent of a candy cane. There is no single main subject, as the camera's sweeping motion is designed to showcase the grand scale and imaginative design of the entire environment. The focus is on establishing a unique and wondrous atmosphere by blending historical architecture with vibrant, industrial fantasy elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
