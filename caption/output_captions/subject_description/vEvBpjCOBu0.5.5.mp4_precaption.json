    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a natural landscape scenery shot of a desolate, fire-ravaged environment. The focus is on the overall atmosphere of destruction rather than a single subject, emphasizing the widespread impact of the fire on the terrain. The ground is a chaotic mix of gray ash, dirt, and countless rocks of varying sizes. Scattered amongst the rocks are large, blackened logs, their surfaces cracked and charred, with some showing exposed, lighter-colored wood underneath. In the background, the skeletal remains of burnt trees and shrubs are visible under bright sunlight, completing the scene of devastation.",
