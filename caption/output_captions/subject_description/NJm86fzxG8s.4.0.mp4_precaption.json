    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a vast, desolate, and snow-covered mountain range under a gray, overcast sky. A heavy fog or mist blankets the scene, obscuring the distance, while soft snowflakes drift down through the air. The focus of the shot is on the immense scale and cold, solitary atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific subject. This is emphasized by a single, small, stylized figure sitting atop a snowy peak, emitting a warm, golden glow that contrasts with the cold, muted tones of the surrounding landscape and illuminates a faint path leading up the slope.",
