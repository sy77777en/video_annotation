    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an urban scenery shot featuring a large-scale architectural structure. The video lacks a specific main subject, as the focus is on the imposing geometry and atmosphere of the environment. The camera begins with a low-angle view looking up at a pale, overcast sky framed by the converging lines of two parallel, elevated concrete tracks. As the view tilts down, it reveals the full structure: a monorail or elevated railway supported by a series of thick, weathered concrete pillars. The stark, grey tracks recede into the distance, creating a strong sense of perspective and scale, while below, a patch of green with tall grass and trees contrasts with the brutalist architecture.",
