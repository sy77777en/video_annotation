    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a sunlit school courtyard. The scene is framed by a large, multi-story brick building with numerous windows and open-air corridors, which encloses a worn basketball court painted in sections of red, green, and yellow. Students in uniform, consisting of white shirts and light-brown pants, are dispersed throughout the space; some are seated on benches along the building's edge, others are gathered in small groups, and one individual with a backpack walks across the foreground. There is no single main subject, as the wide, static shot is designed to capture the overall environment and the ambient atmosphere of daily school life. The focus remains on the place itself, with the students' movements serving as incidental details that contribute to the sense of a living, active space.",
