    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot, beginning with a tilted, low-angle view that pans and straightens to reveal a large, imposing building. The structure is a two-story, symmetrical brick building, possibly a school or institution, featuring numerous multi-paned windows that reflect the cool, blue light of the sky. It has a dark roof, a small central porch with white columns, and sits on a grassy incline against a solid, deep teal sky. There is no main subject in the traditional sense, as the focus is entirely on establishing the location and its somber, slightly ominous atmosphere. The camera's deliberate movement serves to emphasize the scale and starkness of the building within its environment rather than highlighting a specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
