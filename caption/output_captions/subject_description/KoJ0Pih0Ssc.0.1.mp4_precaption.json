    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an expansive cityscape scenery shot, presenting a hazy, golden-hour aerial view of London. The frame is dominated by the iconic Tower Bridge in the foreground, spanning the wide, reflective surface of the River Thames. In the background, a dense collection of modern and historic buildings, including the distinctive shape of City Hall, fades into the misty horizon. The words \"EAST\" and \"WEST\" are superimposed in large white text over the water, bisected by a dashed line that follows the river's course, reinforcing the geographical division. There is no main subject, as the focus is on establishing the vast scale and atmospheric mood of the urban landscape rather than highlighting a specific person or object. The high-angle perspective and wide view serve to capture the environment itself as the point of interest.",
