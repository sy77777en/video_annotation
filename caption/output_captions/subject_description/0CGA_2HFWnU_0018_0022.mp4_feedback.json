    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static, wide-angle cityscape scenery shot, capturing the sprawling urban landscape of a city nestled against a backdrop of majestic mountains. In the foreground, a mix of low-rise residential buildings and lush green trees gives way to a dense cluster of downtown skyscrapers in the mid-ground, with a body of water and a bridge visible to the left. The distant mountains, some with snow-capped peaks, rise under a partly cloudy blue sky. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to emphasize the vast scale of the city and its stunning natural setting. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere rather than any single element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
