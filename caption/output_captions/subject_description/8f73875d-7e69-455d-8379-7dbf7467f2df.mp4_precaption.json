    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, captured from the point-of-view of a vehicle driving down a multi-lane road at dusk. The scene is characterized by significant motion blur, conveying a sense of speed as the camera moves forward past indistinct buildings and other cars. In the distance, traffic lights glow against the fading light of the twilight sky. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the dynamic experience of moving through the urban environment, rather than on a specific object or entity. The rapid movement and wide perspective emphasize the overall scene and the feeling of travel.",
