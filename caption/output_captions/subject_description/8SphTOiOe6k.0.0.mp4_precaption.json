    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a sunlit street corner in a Japanese town. The scene is framed by traditional two-story buildings with cream-colored walls, dark tiled roofs, and reddish-brown wooden paneling. Several shops are open for business, including a food stall under a green awning and another advertising orange-themed products. Pedestrians, some wearing face masks, populate the sidewalk, while two women dressed in elegant kimonos\u2014one in pale purple and the other in a neutral beige\u2014stand near a shop window. The video lacks a single main subject, as the composition is designed to capture the overall atmosphere and vibrant daily life of the bustling commercial street.",
