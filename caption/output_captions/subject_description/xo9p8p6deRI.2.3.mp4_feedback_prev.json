    "pre_caption": "This video presents a miniature model cityscape, depicting a sprawling suburban neighborhood from a bird's-eye perspective. The scene is rendered in a stark, monochromatic style, with simple, blocky white buildings set against a black ground plane, connected by a network of winding roads. The camera initially shows the vast, uniform layout with a slight motion blur before slowly zooming in to isolate a single, more detailed model house, which is identified by the text \"ROBERT KARDASHIAN'S HOUSE\" at the bottom of the screen. There is no main subject in the initial wide shot; the focus is instead on the scale and anonymity of the suburban environment, establishing a sense of place before singling out one specific location.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
