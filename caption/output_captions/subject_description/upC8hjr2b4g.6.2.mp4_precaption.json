    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",
    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot of a dimly lit, narrow hallway leading to a single closed door. The scene is dominated by an intense red glow emanating from a light fixture mounted above the door, casting a sinister hue on the tiled walls and floor. A sign just over the door displays the number \"13\" alongside what appears to be Chinese characters. This stark red light contrasts sharply with the cool, bluish light filtering in from a multi-paned window on the left wall, enhancing the suspenseful and ominous atmosphere. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to establish a mood and a sense of place, focusing on the eerie environment itself rather than a specific person or object.",
