    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins in an empty train car, with natural light from the windows fluctuating between dim and bright as the train moves in and out of tunnels, while the ceiling lights remain consistently on. An older Asian man with glasses, graying hair, a dark blue suit, a white shirt, and a tie with a tie clip briefly peeks his head and shoulders out from a doorway on the left. Following this, a Black person wearing a light pink, textured, oversized sweater with light-colored pants, a headband, white plush slippers, and white plush headphones around her neck emerges from a room and walks toward the camera before exiting to the left. Subsequently, the man who previously peeked out completely exits the doorway and walks down the aisle toward the camera. Walking behind him is a woman with dark hair pulled back, wearing a gray and dark brown patterned poncho over a light-colored hoodie and blue jeans. They both continue walking forward, and the man also exits to the left. Near the end of the video, another man with a black head covering and a black beard appears behind the woman with dark hair pulled back, emerging from the corner between the left doorways.**",
    "pre_caption": "An older man briefly leans his upper body out from a doorway on the left before retracting. A Black person then emerges from a different doorway on the left, walks down the corridor toward the camera, and exits through another doorway on the left. Subsequently, the older man fully exits his doorway and walks down the aisle, followed closely by a woman. The man then exits through a doorway on the left, while the woman continues walking forward. Finally, another man appears from behind a corner on the left and begins walking behind the woman.",
