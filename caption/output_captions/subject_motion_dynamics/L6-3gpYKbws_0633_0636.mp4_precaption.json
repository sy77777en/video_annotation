    "pre_caption": "This is a scenic video of a tropical bay, shot from a split-level perspective at the water's surface. The camera bobs gently in the water, occasionally dipping below the surface.\n\nThe scene above the water features a large, green, conical mountain on the left, with sailboats anchored in the bay before it. On the right is a lush, tree-covered shoreline. The sky is blue with scattered, fluffy white clouds. Below the surface, the clear, greenish-turquoise water reveals a rocky seabed.",
