    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot filmed from a low-angle perspective, looking up towards the sky. The frame is dominated by a deep blue sky with scattered white clouds, contrasted by the underside of a concrete bridge or overpass that cuts diagonally across the view. The camera glides forward, tracking along the length of the structure, creating a sense of steady movement beneath it.",
