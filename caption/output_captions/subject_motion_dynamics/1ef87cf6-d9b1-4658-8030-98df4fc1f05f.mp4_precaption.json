    "pre_caption": "This video contains a static or near-static scenery shot with no significant camera or subject movement.\n\nThe scene is captured from a low-angle perspective, looking up from within a narrow canyon or between two massive rock formations. The rugged, reddish-brown rocks are cast in deep shadow, their dark, craggy silhouettes framing a view of the pale blue sky. A single, small white cloud is visible in the opening between the towering canyon walls.",
