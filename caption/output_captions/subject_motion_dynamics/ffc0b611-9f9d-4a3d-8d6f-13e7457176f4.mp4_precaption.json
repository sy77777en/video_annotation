    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot from a worm's-eye view, looking directly up through the center of a multi-story, rectangular staircase. The warm, orange-colored walls contrast with the dark, ornate metal railings, creating a spiraling, geometric pattern that recedes into the distance. The shot includes a slow, rotating camera movement that enhances the vertiginous perspective.",
