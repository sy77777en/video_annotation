    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject\u2019s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of \u201ca person is running,\u201d say \u201ca runner sprints across the finish line.\u201d\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of \u201ca person is working,\u201d say \u201ca construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.\u201d\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of \u201cpeople are fighting,\u201d say \u201ctwo boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.\u201d\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of \u201cbirds are flying,\u201d say \u201ca flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.\u201d Instead of \u201cpeople are walking,\u201d say \u201ca crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.\u201d Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description\u2014simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man and a woman seated at a low table in a traditional room, suggesting a Japanese tea ceremony. The man on the left is wearing a traditional gray kimono and has dark hair with a noticeable bald patch, styled into a small bun at the back. The woman on the right is dressed in a dark red striped kimono with a prominent blue sash adorned with white floral patterns. Her dark hair is styled in a bun, and she is kneeling, facing the center of the frame with her shoulders slightly straightened. Both individuals are facing away from the camera, looking at a man who suddenly appears in the center of the frame, dressed in a modern style with a black short-sleeved shirt, dark trousers, and a dark baseball cap.**",

They sit on either side of a low table, their backs to the camera, their postures relatively relaxed.\n\nA man in modern clothing suddenly rolls into the room from the right side of the frame, landing in a half-crouch in the center. Initially, he appears excited and joyful when he looks up, but upon noticing the two people in the room, his expression quickly changes, pausing briefly, appearing bewildered. He then quickly straightened up, his movements slightly flustered, his body staggering slightly, his eyes darting left and right as if searching for an escape route. Immediately afterward, he suddenly ran quickly to the left, disappearing from the frame.\n\nThe two Japanese-style figures who had been eating simultaneously reacted with surprise upon the modern man's appearance, leaning back and watching his movements intently. The figure on the left first put down his bowl and chopsticks, then quickly gripped them again with both hands and raised them towards the suddenly intruding man, assuming a defensive stance.",
