    "single": "The video features a cartoonish unicorn character with a gray furry body, a purple snout, and a rainbow-colored headband with a golden horn. The unicorn is smiling, holding a green recycling bin with an apple logo, set against a plain white background. The creature maintains this joyful pose and setting without any movement or changes for the first half of the video. Midway through, the visual representation shifts dramatically to a minimalist style, where the colorful unicorn is now a white silhouette against a black background. Despite the change in color and background, the unicorn's stance, holding the recycling bin, remains the same. Throughout the latter part of the video, there is no observed motion or alteration in the unicorn's silhouette or the scene, maintaining the stark contrast and minimalist aesthetic established at this transition point."
