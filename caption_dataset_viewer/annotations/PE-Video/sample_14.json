The cookies are Halloween-themed shaped like ghosts, bats, spiders and even a Jack-o-lantern shaped cookie. There is a mug of hot chocolate with mini marshmallows and a plate. The video is a still shot from the top-down angle. All the items on the surface slowly move out of the frame except for the calendar. "
