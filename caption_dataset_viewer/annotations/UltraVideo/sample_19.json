The camera movement is not smooth and steady \u2014 it first tilts upward, then tilts downward and pans left with slight unsteadiness, and finally pans right.\n\n4. The fishing rod is not stationary \u2014 it first moves forward and then turns to the right.",

    "single": "The video captures a serene fishing scene at a rocky coastline. It opens with a wide shot of the rugged terrain and tranquil waters, featuring a fishing rod prominently placed on the rocks, its line extending into the clear blue water. The camera slowly pans across the scene, highlighting the intricate textures of the rocks and the small pools of water among them. Gentle waves lap against the rocks, creating a soothing sound that adds to the peaceful ambiance. The video reveals more of the coastline, including distant cliffs and a clear blue sky, with soft and warm lighting indicating either early morning or late afternoon. This enhances the natural beauty of the scene. The fishing rod, with its black and yellow design, remains stationary, symbolizing a patient and calm approach to fishing. The dark, textured rocks and clear, blue water with gentle waves convey a sense of tranquility and connection with nature. The video's documentary style, using wide and medium shots with smooth, steady camera movements, allows viewers to fully immerse themselves in the picturesque and serene setting, creating a comfortable and healing atmosphere."
