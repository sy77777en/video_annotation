The ATM is spitting out a large lot of money, which are rapidly pouring out of the cash outlet. The camera sways and then moves backwards.\nNext, the camera switches to a man who stands outdoors with city streets and buildings in the background. The man wears a light-coloured, long-sleeved shirt and has short hair. He looks surprised. He turns his head left and looks down. A red and grey bus can be seen in the background, along with some pedestrians and buildings.\nThe camera switches back to the ATM. A sentence appears slowly on the ATM's screen which reads \"Honestly I thought you would have more money than this\"."
